Kinda get this feeln' like wow, yeah baby
Been tryin' to say it
But I just don't quite know how?
Oh but now I'm hangin' on
Strong to the hope that I see in your eyes
Every time you look my way
I can feel your heart beat
And it feels like a brand new day
So please say
That love will be waiting
And it will never ever go away, away, away
You been tryin' to tell me
How you were feelin' inside, yeah lady
Somehow I miss you
I can't tell you why
Oh but please gimme just one more chance
To make it up to you and I promise
Every time you call my name
I will hear your heart speak
And it speaks of a brand new day
And you'll say
That love will be waiting
And it will never

I will hear your heart speak
And it speaks of a brand new day
And you'll say
That love will be waiting
And it will never ever go away
Never go away
Never go away

Suddenly, don't know from where you came
Like a tornado, you swept me off my feet
You captured me with your esoteric charm
Too good to be true, yet to real to be a dream
The excitement, it's killing me
He walked up to me, so close took both my hands in his
Looked me straight in the eyes, stroke my hair behind my ears
He gave me a kiss on the forehead and a star up in the sky
He told me it would last forever, but then he said goodbye
Repetition, here we go again
It's nice to meet you, I hope you feel the same
Is this real, or is this that same old dream
Where I get to hold you right before you slip away
I can't take it, it's killing me
He walked up to me, so close took both my hands in his
Looked me straight in the eyes, stroke my hair behind my ears
He gave me a kiss on the forehead and a star up in the sky
He told me it would last forever, but then he said goodbye

I feel your body's close to mine
I hear your breath and mine in time
I know I'm nothing but it's you that I need
I touch your skin and it starts to feed
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
My eyes meet yours in secret glance
Our bodies look in ancient stance
You whisper something and I
know it's good
You're acting crazy just like I
knew you would
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
Embracing my life between your thighs
We will perform in the deadly skies
Reducing my mind to endless nights
You send my dreams to their demise
Realized by your last vreath
I take your hair in to my hands
I pull it tight to fit your demands
feel my body in to yours
know it's right cause that's
my soul you stir
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash

When all you need was a little motivation
They pointed fingers and yelled dead generation
When all you need was a little care
You get nothing but an old white hair bland stare
Have you ever needed an ounce of love
And all you got was a whole lot of fucked
So say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation
Condescending broad generalizations
Get real, real fast
Just because most hippies and their parents have sold out
Doesn't mean that you, your children and their kids won't last
So say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation
So say your prayers
It's the death of a nation
Say your prayers
For the dead generation
Aggressiveness is godliness
Combativeness is holiness
Destructiveness is faithfulness
Deadliness is devoutness
Praying to a God that they created
And know damn well does not exist
We'll find them on their knees

Ooh, I loved you so
But why I loved you I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you
And oh, ah, whoa, the pain you put me through
You don't care 'bout my love for you, huh
But I found a reason for livin'
And I'm through with cryin' over you
And now I feel a song in my heart again
I knew as soon as I felt him lookin' through me
I feel a song in my heart again
High on the wings of the things he's doin' to me
Oh, that a man is fine
Ooh, what's even better the man is mine
He makes me feel just like a woman
Something that you could never do
And now I feel a song in my heart again
I found a man who can put it all together
I feel a song in my heart again
I'm gonna love him and make it last forever
(Our worlds have come to an end)
(I feel a song in my heart again)
Oh, oh, oh, it feels so good
You, you, you, you, you never understood
He makes me feel like I'm somethin'
And I'm gonna keep him if I can
I know I feel a song in my heart again
Now I can open my eyes to a new door
I feel a song in my heart again
The man is all that I need to fill my love up
I feel a song, ooh, what a feelin'
I feel it takin' me higher and higher
I feel a song in my heart again
His kind of lovin' I can never get enough of
I don't need your lovin' 'cause I got his lovin'
Woo, I feel a song again, ooh, y'all
I've been born again, ooh
(I feel a song in my heart again, feel it)
I feel a song in my heart again
I've got to tell you he's twice the man that you were
I feel a song in my heart again

Another day or so he'd be one year older
God bless his soul
Nearly 18 years old when he became a soldier
God bless his soul
It's not like he didn't know
The way that things could go
Hope was all he had to cope
But he never made it home
I hope and pray
That when God called his name
He did not die in vain
I'd like to think he died for you and me
And I hope one day
When we look back again
And he's just a memory
That we'll appreciate, respect the life he gave
In another year or so she might have been a mother
God bless her soul
But she'll never get to hold her baby girl, I know her
God bless their souls
It's not like she didn't know
The way that things could go
Hope was all she had to cope
But she never made it home
I hope and pray
That when God called her name
She did not die in vain
I'd like to think she died for you and me
And I hope one day
When we look back again
And she's just a memory
That we'll appreciate, respect the life she gave
And I hope and pray
That when God called their name
That they did not die in vain
I'd like to think that they died for you and me
And I hope one day
When we look back again
And they're just a memory
That we'll appreciate, respect the life they gave
Respect the life they gave
Respect the life they gave

She wakes up to face the cold world
Full of empty words she'll prolly get hurt
She doesn't wanna be a big star
The flashy lights or the fast cars
She volunteers down at the welfare
Where spends a lot of time cause no one else cares
They out chasing them fast cars
Yeah they wanna be big stars
But just a little smile goes a long long way
If you need me im coming
Just hold on im running
Just let your love shine out
No matter the colour
We're sister and brothers
Just let your love shine out
Hes feeling low, lifes out of control
Like a traffic sign, he on stop he cant go
On his knees he prays real hard
Only time can heal these scars
Holding a sign just begging for a buck
Yeah he needs a little help or someone he can trust
On his knees he prays real hard
Dont leave me you done brought me this far
Just a little smile goes a long long way
If you need me im coming
Just hold on im running
Just let your love shine out
No matter the colour
We're sister and brothers
Just let your love shine out
Sing it out as loud as you can
I love ya I love ya
Sing it out as loud as you can

If you need me im coming
Just hold on im running
Just let your love shine out
No matter the colour
We're sister and brothers
Just let your love shine out

The band played, no one moved
They could not find the groove
I knew that wouldn't last
Someone had to act fast
I took the mic for a moment
That's when I sang
This is no talent show
And the floor is ready to go
I know you want to dance
So come on while we have a chance
All I heard was a cough
I started to walk off
Then people wanted more
As they all rushed the floor
I told the band to follow
That's when I sang
This is no talent show
And the floor is ready to go
I know you want to dance
So come on while we have a chance
This is no talent show
And the floor is ready to go
I know you want to dance
So come on while we have a chance

Darling you must know that you are only mine
Not for just right now but all the time
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
Are the only things that you said on the day we met
This love I try to fight but I couldn't know love too long
And I knew the way that I was, I wouldn't be round too long
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
When I think about all the things you said
To help me through my days
Now I need you more desperately than I ever did
All the things we've done, all the things you say
Just drives me outta my head
So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I want you to stay with me, baby, yeah
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
Please take my love, that's all I have to give
Just right now you're giving me a reason to live
Help me understand what I feel is real
For no love has meant this much to me
In the past couple of years
And if you let me there is nothing I wouldn't do for you
And if you trust me with your love
Then I will make your dreams come true
So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I just want you to stay a while with me, baby
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
C'mon and stay
Oh, c'mon take me by the hand, oh
Heaven, I want you to cherish me c'mon, c'mon

It's a gut check of what you believe
A Global Pax Americana
Neo-con, neo-fascist blue print U.S.A. hegemony
Charlatan war hawks, untried, untrue
Celebrate and exploit tragedy to steal away control
And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a new American century?
Endless
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?
Or never ending hate?
It's a think tank, psycho and crazed
War profiteering membership, a world catastrophe
They've got a war plan that counts on you
To kill for their corporate empire while they sit at home
And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a new American century?
Endless
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?
Are you going to fight back
Time to prove what you really believe
We gotta fight back
Until we win the fall
We gotta fight back
Will you heed the call?
The neo-fascist race to war
The PNAC plan to rule the world
It's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a new American century?
Are you going to?
And it's a gut check of what you believe
Will you stand up for democracy?
Or a new American century?
Endless violence, endless hatred
Endless empire tyranny
Will you make a stand for human dignity?
Will you? Or never ending hate

Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
You got me reeling and rocking, don't know what to do, what do do
I want you, I need you, you got me spinning like a top
I want you, I need you, you got me spinning like a top
If you don't love me I believe my heart will stop, it will stop
I'm crying, the sun is shining, but it's raining in my heart
I'm crying, the sun is shining, but it's raining in my heart
You got me reeling and rocking, since we've been apart, been apart
Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
You got me reeling and rocking, don't know what to do, what do do

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Hush it's not safe to talk
That terminal could be switched on
The IBMs could monitor
And flag the things we say
Make sure you keep your cover up
And cover up your TV
When you call me
And make sure you watch your TV every day
And take nothing for granted
It's a war always remember
It's like holding back the ocean
Trying to hold onto your mind
Don't forget the reason
Why you started in the first place
It's a struggle like no other for the fate of humankind
[repeat]
And take nothing for granted
It's a war always remember
It's like holding back the ocean
Trying to hold onto your mind
Don't forget the reason
Why you started in the first place
It's a struggle like no other for the fate of humankind
The fate of humankind

My dad doesn't wear a shirt
He likes to walk around in a yellow skirt
He always says hi and flirts with me
Wonders if I wanna see his broccoli
He always touches my tasty banana
masturbates to Hannah Montana
He sits and watches the telly
He has a bump on his big fat belly
I don't like my dad at all, I don't like my dad at all
My mom doesn't seem to like me at all
She threatened to cut off my balls
She once threw an apple in my face
I'm just glad she didn't hit my special place
She spits in my food
she acts really rude
She takes a shit on my pillow
She entered my ass with a dirty dildo
I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my mom at all
I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my dad at all, I don't like my dad at all
I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my dad at all, I don't like my dad at all
I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my dad at all, I don't like my dad at all
I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my mom at all, I don't like my dad at all, I don't like my dad at all
He always touches my tasty banana
masturbates to Hannah Montana
He sits and watches the telly
He has a bump on his big fat belly
She spits in my food
she acts really rude
She takes a shit on my pillow
She entered my ass with a dirty dildo
I don't like my folks at all, I don't like my folks at all

Look at you
And if I wanted to,
I could see someone in there
Who'd like to be the happiest clam on the beach
But look at you
You're the Angry Clown
Trying to push all the kids around
But there's a flying horse that could change that course
Hey Hey Hey!
Hey Luno!
Hey Hey Hey!
Hey Luno!
Can he stop the enemy?
-We only believe in what we see!
But he can do it, you never know
-But we don't know!
Hey Hey Hey!
Hey Luno!
Hey Hey Hey!
Hey Luno!
Why can't you just call his name?
Then Luno could come down
And take you far away to the land of the same
Then you'll see how fun it is
That flying horse is true
And you're stuck in a world with people just as sad as you
Can he stop the enemy?
-We only believe in what we see!
But he can do it, you never know
-But we don't know!
Just call his name
And he will come
The Flying Horse
Luno:
Hey Hey Hey!
Hey Luno!

I don't feel that prejudice,
Can't see divided lines.
To me we are all just the same,
Our difference in our souls and minds.
You tell me that the difference,
Is red, brown, black and white.
A world of such variety,
To you becomes an excuse for hate.
(Chorus)
We've gotta learn, have hope, unite
And care enough to end this fight.
You're hating with no real insight,
And burning crosses in the night.
A hundred years of barriers,
Yet still we can't see fit
To bring about world unity
And learn to live with it.
Now I'm not just complaining
And I won't preach to anyone,
But we should think about it
'Cos this war has not just begun.
(Repeat Chorus)

Again
This couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more
This never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly, suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never, never, never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear
What matters, what matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never, never, never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear and oh
What matters, what matters, what matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again, again
Never, never again, again

Please don't cry, that's not the way I want to go
I did the best that I could
The sacred souls of the reluctant few
Wander the world like they should
You said my life was so different
You said you loved me for me
You said I was one in a million
Isn't that what you believe?
Don't think you have to say something
I don't expect that of you
You are just like all the others
Nothing that speaks of the truth
Well, the streets don't shine like I was led to believe
How could you do this to me?
You serve up your swill when it's time to feed
You say it's the way it will be
You said my life was so different
You said you loved me for me
You said I was one in a million
Isn't that what you believe?
Don't think you have to say something
I don't expect that of you
You are just like all the other
Nothing that speaks of the truth

All night out on the streets
I got the back of all my friends
We never want to go back home
Never want the night to end
Because we want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free, free, free
We want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free
We want to be free, free, free, free
The schools that they send us to are prisons
The same can be said for their churches too
I don't want my mind or my arms tied in bondage
I don't want to be another cloned state tool

Spoon-feed me medicine
Shed myself, see me for who I am today
My will is genuine
Mistaken for someone that you embrace
My sober eyes are red
My mind is spinning around an error that I create
Someone to represent, someone I forget, something I will never bandage
Separate
Soak your head into the sulfur
Stay patient for me
Paint yourself my favorite color
Stay pretty for me
I bled myself out again
You possess something that I never could replace
My time is running thin
You won't be back again
My time is running thin
You won't be back until I say so
Put your head under the water
Stay quiet for me
Make your mouth a little smaller
Stay quiet for me

Spin round
Tell me what to say
Break down
And no other way
What is it
Is this it
This is it
Back to
I never knew your name
Stick through
Soon after the rain
She shines
How she shines
This is it
And shadows blend one last time (save those kisses)
Your picture speaks on this time (eyelash wishes)
Cause I been up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
The world still turns
What makes sense
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
And all things close
All I wish
Never change these distances
Green eyes
Everything I see
Green skies
If left up to me
And I know
And she knows
This is it
And shadows blend one last time (save those kisses)
Your picture speaks on this time (eyelash wishes)
'Cause I've been up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
The world still turns
What makes sense
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
And all things close
All I wish
Never change these distances
Just be brave
Just listen to me
Your heart gives mine reason to beat
Now
'Cause I've been up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
The world still turns
What makes sense
Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days
Awake awake
2 more weeks
And I'm turning to fade
And all things close
All I wish
Never change these distances
And shadows blend one last time (save those kisses)
Your picture speaks on this time (eyelash wishes)

Waiting for Charlie to come home
Bring me all the love I need
Waiting for Charlie to come home
Bring me his lips, his wild hungry arms
And all of the love that I need
I said a lot of things to him I didn't mean to say
Instead of holding him close to me I drove him far away
Here am I the fool who let happiness walk out the door, no
And I don't really believe that he wants to come back to me anymore
And I'm waiting for Charlie to come home
And bring me all the love I need
Waiting for Charlie to come home
Bring me his lips, his wild hungry arms
And all of the love that I need

Ruler of my heart
Driver of my soul
Where can you be?
I wait patiently
My heart cries out
Pain inside
Where can you be
I wait patiently
When you're alone
The going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back
I've had enough
Make me a queen
Happy again
Hear my cry
Please, my king
When you're alone
The going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back
I've had enough
Make me a queen
Happy again
Hear my cry
Please, my king

umph....umph...umph!
I'm tripping out, I'm tripping out over you baby, over you baby
I'm tripping out, I'm tripping out over you baby, over you
Each day I'm not with you, is like a day without sunshine
I'm hung up on you baby, you've become a part of me - oowee
You're not like other girls or is it my imagination
This pounding in my heart, girl, it's all because of you
You've got me...
Tripping out, tripping out over you baby, over you - little mama
I'm tripping out, tripping out over you baby, over you baby
Let me be your slave because I want to worship you
I'll do anything you say, anything you want me to do
To me you are a queen, and I'm your knight in shining armour
standing guard over the love, the love you've given me
You've got me...
Tripping out, tripping out over you baby
I'm going crazy for you mama
I'm tripping out, tripping out over you, c'mon

c'mon
Each day I'm not with you is like a day without sunshine
I'm hung up on your love, you've become a part of me
To me you are my queen, and I'm your knight in shining armour
standing guard over the love, the love you've given me

I saw right through your eyes
I saw right through your guise
Every word that left you lips was
Just a covert disguise to hide your absent mind
You live and breathe, sleep and drink
Beg and plead, blind, diseased
No water can wash the blood off your hands
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
Traded the Nobel Peace Prize
Exchanged for Vietnamese lives
Bombs filled the Cambodian skies
In East Timor you stood up for the wrong side
Wrong side, wrong side
You live and breathe, sleep and drink
Beg and plead, blind, diseased
No water can wash the blood off your hands
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't

Should I even listen
Should I even try
Will I just be hearing the same old lines
See it doesn't matter
What you say this time
'cause our whole relationship
Is built on one lie
You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me
How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night
Gotta hand it to you
You had me there for a while
I was so in love with you
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
Boy, I got a wake up call
And it left the message
That you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to
Believe that she doesn't mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin' my darling
I just don't need
Hook
Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you
To me last night
Oh baby why
Why do men think that love's just for the moment
Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere
Are you deservin'
Don't blame me if
I just don't believe
I just don't believe
That you'll always be here
Hook

In the twinkling of an eye
Girl you had me hypnotized
And I didn't care a thing about love
But I quickly start believin'
'Cause I found myself a reason in you
Yea I got a thang for you
And when I think
Think of the way I used to be
I was always all alone
Always doing something wrong
And when I think
Think of the change you brought to me
Girl I wonder why it took you so long
[Chorus]
Well alright
Well OK baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
Well alright
Well OK baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
It was deep within my heart
Where the feelin' had to start
I had reason to believe it was love
And I'm sure that's what it was
'Cause I've never felt so much in me
Yea you brought love into me
And when I think
Think of they way things used to be
I was always much too cold
I was always all alone
And when I think baby
Think of the love you brought to me
I don't know how I could've ever got along
[Chorus]
In this wake of happiness
I can't help but feel blessed
From you baby
'Cause of you girl
For the first time in my life
I know I've done it right
I fell in love with you
[Chorus]

Oooh, oooh (x2)
Climb the highest mountain
Sail across the sea
Take a look in your social book
You'll find that
Nobody loves you like me, no, no, no.
Nobody loves you like me.
Travel across the desert
Climb up a big redwood tree
Ask a worm that's about to turn
He'll say that nobody loves you like me, no, no, no.
Nobody loves you like me.
You can hunt and scour
On the Eiffel tower
But if you don't choose
It's me you're gonna lose

When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
Oh when I look at you
I probably should go
Cause I wanna be with you
More than you'll ever know
Hmm for a taste of you
I could calm my desire
Baby you blow my mind
You light my fire, oh
I want you (yeah)
Need you (yeah)
Can't live without you
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
Is it the way I feel?
The curiosity or the things you do
That brings out the lust in me
The thought of me and you, drives me wild
Come close to me
Can you stay awhile?
Hold you, need you
Can't live without you
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
Yeah
Hold you, need you
Can't live without you
When I'm all alone at night
I can hear the beating of your heart
I should tell you and I might
Before you tear me apart
You're all I ever think about
All I ever dream about
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

Sons and daughters of a dream
The urge to struggle for an ideal
To stay and fight, oppose war fever
Refuse to kill or be killed
There's voice's calling in the wind
Power to the peaceful
Power to the peaceful, oh
Let's go, oh yeah, alright
With a readiness for war
They come down hard on dissent of all forms
Blood and militarism has swept the country by storm
There's voices calling in the wind
Power to the peaceful
Power to the peaceful, oh
Power to the peaceful
Power to the peaceful, oh
This is not a war of the urging people
This is not a war of economic independence
It's a war for conquest, it's a war for military power
It's a war for money, the road to universal slaughter
Oh no, yeah go
Sons and daughters of a dream
The urge to struggle for an ideal
To stay and fight, oppose war fever
Refuse to kill or be killed
There's voice's calling in the wind
Power to the peaceful
You know it's power to the peaceful
Alright, check this out
There's repression and intolerance
On any deviation from the norm
In all factions of your life
At this time of entry into war
Say hey, hey, if you know what they sing
Say hey, hey, yeah you know what they sing
Say hey, hey, do you know what they sing?
Say hey, hey, hey, hey
Power to the peaceful
Power to the peaceful, oh
Power to the peaceful
Power to the peaceful, oh
Alright, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Lets talk about the question of what you should or shouldnt think
I dont think you know it. Cause youre drinking at their place
Make up your mind, dont sit here wasting my time. You just said youre a nazi,
so why are you in my face
I feel my blood is pumping
My heart nearly stops, forgets to beat
I know that he is watching
Though I try to ignore we always seem to meet
All of a sudden theres a guy in front of me
He said I heard you hate us, oh but I wanna be your friend
Is this a fucking joke, I will never understand
Why these guys, these guys care about me
I feel my blood is pumping, my heart nearly stops, forgets to beat
I feel my blood is pumpin
I feel my blood is pumpin
I feel my blood is pumping, my heart nearly stops, forgets to beat

My heart has been broken cause of you
One always must leave, that's nothing new
I thought that you'd really like to try to stay
Stay together, let's try again
It's been 17 months on my own
The nights are so quiet all alone
I long to feel you in my arms again
Girl, won't you please come back home
Spendin' my nights all alone
Really, really wish you'd come home
Savin' my heartbreak for you
Makes me blue, sadder than blue
Days walk past me like years
I struggle to swallow my tears
It's been a long time since I held you near
I still remember the scent of you dear
29 hours in my day
Feel like hell every day
Hopin' I get through to you
'cause I sure miss you
Come back, come back to me
Hook
I never wanted to swallow my pride
I tried to play it cool, so cool
Girl, if we only could go back in time
I wouldn't hold back a damn thing from you
Hook

I got a nuclear explosion
Breathing down my back
And my brain is burning
Look through the pins in my eyes
Well I don't care about living
(Well all I care about?s singing)
And I don't care if I die
I got a flame thrower love
Honey can't you see

We fell in love and who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder
Why we didn't last
We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves
So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves
When everybody says to let it end
It makes me wonder
We can't let them win
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
If we'd only just try we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I want to know that, that we can go back
Back to a time when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

This is for the girl down the hall
Misused and abused
Yeah, yeah yeah
Pick ya head up love, smile
This is for you
Girl I know sometimes that I mistreat you, and you still come back
And I see your homegirls try to reach you, but you ain't hearing none of that
They try to get through, they say I ain't the move
I don't know, cause girl it might be true
When they tell you, you should walk away but you stay anyway
Girl I think it's best for me to say this, I ain't no good
And your heart ain't something I should play with
So let's get it understood
I ain't trying to ruin your life
If anything I just want to make it right
And tell the judge I ain't even gotta plead my case
I can tell my baby to her face
I was just your nigga next door
But girl I see more for you, (I see more for you)
And you ain't gotta have no fear, no I'll always be here for you, girl I'm here for you
And I know you may not end up with me
'Cause I'm still playing outchea in these streets
But I'm just saying
You deserve better, I'm saying, you deserve better
I know that love can be blind
But you should open your eyes (open your eyes)
Take a look in the mirror
Baby girl you a prize
And any man that don't see that you should let his ass go, believe that
Because his love ain't real
What he won't do another nigga will
Girl I think it's best for me to say this, I ain't no good

Ten easy steps to create an enemy and start a war
Listen closely because we will all see this weapon used in our lives
It can be used on a society of the most ignorant
To the most highly educated, we need to see these tactics as a weapon
Against humanity and not as truth
This is how to create an enemy
This is how to start a war
This is how to create an enemy
First step
Create the enemy
Sometimes this will be done for you
Second step
Be sure the enemy you have chosen is nothing like you
Find obvious differences like race, language, religion
Dietary habits, fashion
Emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job
They are heartless murderers who enjoy killing
Third step
Once these differences are established
Continue to reinforce them with all disseminated information
Fourth step
Have the media broadcast only the ruling party's information
This can be done through state run media
Remember, in times of conflict
All for-profit media repeats the ruling party's information
Therefore all for-profit media state-run
Fifth step
Show this enemy in actions that seem strange, militant or different
Always portray the enemy as non-human, evil, a killing machine
This is how to create an enemy
This is how to start a war
This is how to create an enemy
Sixth step
Eliminate opposition to the ruling party
Create an "Us versus them" mentality
Leave no room for opinions in between
One that does not support all actions of the ruling party
Should be considered a traitor
Seventh step
Use nationalistic and or religious symbols
And rhetoric to define all actions
This can be achieved by slogans such as
"Freedom loving people versus those who hate freedom"
This can also be achieved by the use of flags
Eighth step
Align all actions with the dominant deity
It is very effective to use terms like
"It is God's will" or "God bless our nation"
Ninth step
Design propaganda to show that your soldiers have feelings
Hopes, families and loved ones
Make it clear that your soldiers are doing a duty
They do not want or like to kill
Tenth step
Create and atmosphere of fear and instability
Then offer the ruling party as the only solution
To comfort the public's fears
Remembering the fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear
This is how to create an enemy
This is how to start a war
This is how to create an enemy
We are not countries, we are not nations
(Enemy)
We are not religions, we are not Gods
We are not weapons, we are not ammunition
(Enemy)
We are not killers, we will not be tools
Motherfuckers
I will not die, I will not kill
I will not be your slave
I will not fight your battle
I will not die on your battlefield
I will not fight for your wealth
I am not a fighter
I am a human being

This is my same old coat
These are my same old shoes
It was the same old me
With a same old blues
Oh, then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And when I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl, oh me
Just because of you (just because of you)
Just because of you, woah
Just becasue of you (just because of you)
Just because of you
I've got the same old friends
And they've got the same old shins
I tell the same old jokes
And I get the same old grins
But now the joke is on you
It happened somehow with you
Everyday of my life
I'm as fresh as morning dew
Just because of you (just because of you)
Just because of you, woah
Just becasue of you, oh (just because of you)
Just because of you
I go to the same old places (same old)
I see the same old faces
I look at the same old sky (same old)
See it all with a brand new light
I got brand new boy (brand new)
And I got me a brand new smile
Since I found you baby
I got me a brand new star

If there's anyone here
Who knows why these two people should not be joined together
Let them speak now or forever hold their peace
Wait, wait stop the wedding
You just marrying her for spite
If she knew the inside story
She'd tell you what your doing just ain't right
I know you don't wanna hurt me
So stop this madness before it starts
Revenge will only cause you regret
So don't do it, don't do it
Don't break two hearts
(Don't break two hearts)
'Cause you belong to me, oh darlin'
And I belong to you and deep down inside me now
I know you feel that way too
So baby, don't do it (don't do it)
Don't do it (don't do it) don't do it (don't do it)
Oh, don't you break two hearts
(Oh don't break two hearts)
No, no, no baby don't do it (don't you do it)
Don't do it (don't you do it)
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)
Oh, don't you break, don't you break two hearts
(Oh don't break two hearts)
No, no, no, no, don't do it (don't you do it)
Don't do it (don't you do it)
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)
Oh, don't break two hearts
(Oh, don't break two hearts)
No,no, no,no, don't do it (don't you do it)
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)
Oh, oh don't you break two hearts
(Oh, don't break two hearts)

You knew you were right-until I proved you wrong
You knew you were on track-till I showed you that you were lost
You knew that things were going good-till I showed you what life's really like
You're not everything you thought you were
*chorus*
It's not too late, not yet at least
You can always change for the better
I'm not saying it's easy, but neither is life
You've noticed your mistakes, it's time to make a change
You knew you weren't right - when I showed you how bad you were
You knew you were lost - but I told you how to get back on track
You knew things weren't good - when I showed you your life
Do you notice the mistakes you've made

Feel you move through this crowded room
And I catch myself like a spell fallen under you
I've been here before
Watching the wheels go round
Everybody that I've ever known
They just ache all night and they wake up alone
Yeah, we wait in the dark
For something to put us to sleep
And, oh, my dear, you never know how
'Til the things you've done come and run you down
And we want love like it was a drug
All we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
And could you be to me a love supreme?
'Cause we wait out this life just to hold on to anything
'Cause most of the sparks are just sweet little cherry bombs
Oh my dear don't make a sound
'Till somebody burns you and spits you out
And we want love like it was a drug
All we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
Use me up (use me up)
Yeah and I'll be enough
Come and use me up (use me up)
Oh don't you love the way I drag you down?
Ain't that enough for you now?
Don't you want love like it was a drug?
Yea don't you want a little relief?
From every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
And we want love like it was a drug
Yeah all we wanted was a little relief
And every heart I held in between
They were painkillers to me
They were painkillers to me
Come get your painkillers from me

It's in the paper every day
I see it in the headlines and I feel so sick, yeah
As another life leaves this world, this world
So full of hate but short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity
Asking myself in vain, shaken by the shock
"Do we even have a chance?"
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
This is a plea for peace, world peace
To the oppressors of the world and to
To the leaders of nations, corporate profit takers
To the everyday citizen
Greed, envy, fear, hate, the competition has to stop
When you see someone down
Now's the time to pick them up
Set your differences aside, never look back, no
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
Isn't everybody tired of the fighting? Hey, hey
Isn't everybody tired of the killing? Hey, hey
Isn't everybody tired of the dying? Hey, hey
Isn't everybody tired of the hatred? Hey, hey
Violence hey hey, fighting hey
Killing hey, dying hey
And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream, we will be able to speed up that day
When all of God's children, black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands and sing "Free at last, free at last
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last"
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna die
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
We are all human

It's giving me a chill
Every time I think
About the love we make
It makes my heart sink
Deep into my soul
Everywhere I go
I'm always thinking of
When we make love
Wanna go back to the day
When I touched you girl in every way
Gotta take the change to hear you say
That you want me girl
Girl you know you rocked my world
'cause
I can't eat, can't sleep
You know that it's unnatural
What you do to me
You know that it's so sexual
What's come over me
Never thought that love could be so addicting
The feeling hurt so bad
It makes my body weak
I can taste you even when you're not with me
Look what you've done to me
Wanna go back to the day
When I touched you girl in every way
Gotta take the change to hear you say
That you want me girl
Girl you know you rocked my world

You are the only girl i
I wanna share my world

One night of sin
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make a dream stand still
[Chorus]
Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I've lost my sweet helping hand
I've got myself to blame
Always lived a very quiet life
I ain't never done no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Been too lonely too long
One night of sin
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make a dream stand still
I lived a very quiet life
I ain't never done no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Been to lonely too long
[Chorus]

I took a shot at the world
And I missed (amo te')
Traded my bow for a new year's kiss
Broken arrows and loveless wrists
Tell "J.C." I'm dying in Mass
And if it wasn't so cold
I'd swear this was hell

Land of treason-waste no reason-
we are breathing fire
We're packs of dogs-
we're enemies of men-we are not desired
Our face show-
we've grown cold-but
have not conspired
Old hearts gone-
the future's on-mother nations mired
I like a recepticle for the chosen dead,
we find our bodies clawed
And with the scent of death,
we find that we are not so very awed
Loyalties burned-
the words our blurred-overturn your own
Walk like dogs and watch the doors-
have your other stone
Stop the toys that match disordered-
calculate the thrones
Feel the pulse descending-
decaying hallowed tomes
In the starving sense you worship-
the nations of debris
You wear a cost of sewage-
that you've never ever seen
The time is now-the vicious here-
a stolen dinner code
The license of the savage land-
that you've always sold
So bite the hand that needs you
and bless another coal
The virus never issues-
from a cotton so very old
As the lights come down
You wash your hands and start to climb
the ladder that you stole
Slip the hatch-and spin the sword-
the money lords are poor
Push the tan-that rolls downhill-
their sense of dream absorbed
Still the cat that breaks the night-
tie him to the core
Chase the viruses that believe-
that what's right is scored
It's a senseless cash in of right for right-
what's wrong is never gone
And left is just a bassion for the fools
golden dawn

City of the angels spread your wings for me
I've been other places looking for my dream
Eastern cities move to fast
Southern ones to slow
I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow
City of the Angels
Clear your cloudy skies for me
I heard you got some places that I ought to see
Heard you got a Disneyland not to far away
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day
LA, LA, find a place for me
Give me all your spaces please
It's where I want to be
City of the Angels spread your wings for me
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see
Heard 'bout your Disneyland not to far away from town
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day
LA, LA, find a place for me
Give me all your spaces please
It's where I want to be
I heard you got a Disneyland not to far away
And when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day
LA, LA, find a place for me
Give me all your spaces please
It's where I want to be

Baby Come To Me
I will chase your tears away
Put your trust in me
Girl I swear I'll never change
Darling you will see
That my love is here to stay
I promise you, I will be true
From here and now, forever girl I
[Chorus]
I said I love you
I said I care
When I tell you I love you
It means I always will be there
I'll never leave you
I ain't going nowhere
When I tell you I love you
Cross my heart I will be there
Open up your heart
Don't be afraid to love again
We can take it slow
You should know I understand
Baby take your time
And I don't care how long it takes
Cause I promise you, I'm here for you
From here and now, forever girl I
[Chorus]
And I will be there
(And I will be there for you)
Forever sincere to you
(Girl I'll always care for you)
I just want to share my life with you
Right here, right now, forever girl I
[Chorus]

I'm crawling through my tunnel
When everything is dim
where does one go
I crawl in to my tunnel
It's kinda shaky may even crumble
I'm talking to a lame man
When you're maimed
where does one go
I fall into my tunnel...
I'm walking into the jungle
When everything is right
where does one go
I walk into the jungle
Sometimes I run-sometimes I stumble
I'm talking to a saved man
When you are sane
where does one go
Back into the jungle
Out, out, out of the tunnel
Back, Back, to the jungle
Out, out, out of the tunnel
Take me back to my jungle

I'm Darby Crash
A social blast
Chaotic master
I'm Darby Crash
Your meccas gash
Prophetic stature
I'm Darby Crash
A one way match
Demonic flasher
Deep, deep, deep, in my eyes
There's a round, round, round,
circle of lives
It's a tame, tame, tame sort of world
Where you're caught, bought,
taught, as it twirls...
I'm Darby Crash
A social blast
Chaotic master
Snap, crackle, pop
Snap, crackle, pop
Snap, crackle, pop-in here
Snap, crackle, pop
Snap, crackle, pop
Snap, crackle, pop-out there

I take it anywhere, any time that I can
I am the fucking son of a superman
I got a weapon that's as deadly as life
It's a well trained tool, a master guy
Every day it's the same, regime
A dozen girls are on my scene
Say sex boy, will you come into my hand
They're all on the floor, I better do what I can
Take a number, it's supply and demand
Anytime that I can
I'm the fucking son of a superman
I got a weapon that's as deadly as life
It's a well trained tool, a master guy
I put my knife into your gut
You gotta be above when you're above
Wanna make love
Say it exactly, sex boy, such a sideshow poster
After such a sweet, sweet slut
Any time that I can
I'm the fucking son of a superman
I know what it takes
What in the time that I can and can't do
I know what it takes to satisfy you
I know what it takes
That's why your time is due
In the house of fortune
I take it out and you know
It's gonna come from behind
Just like you and you and you and you

Each time I fight the battle, they've won again
And I know there is no use in denying, they just can't win
Oh, won't they bring my soul-------------------
And they see that there is troubled waters, they move, they cry
And they see this is no tomorrow and they decide
Lord, have mercy on my soul!
And they stand there and ask me these questions
What do I know?
And they see this is just no denying
They just can't go
Lord, have mercy on my soul!

Oh, baby
Girl, don't pull the rug from under my feet (don't do it, baby)
Don't leave, don't leave me so, I'm talking in my sleep
This could be the start of a nightmare
Waking up and not finding you there
It would be more that I could stand
Oh, baby
Girl, don't leave me so I'm pacing the floor (don't do it, baby)
'Cause that's, that's what I'll do if you close the door
Maybe I've been too hung-up on myself
But don't change me by putting my heart on a shelf
'Cause that's more than I could stand
Why you wanna leave me?
Why you wanna go?
I promise not
To never, never hurt you no more
Oh, please don't leave me
Please don't go
By causin' my heart to ache
Causin' it to break
We, we've still got a lot of love to give (yeah)
So turn around, baby (turn around)
While there's a lot of life to live
Leavin' me would ruin all of my plans
It would be like tying the both of my hands
And that's more, baby, than I could stand
Why you wanna leave me?
Why you wanna go?

Sit right down and talk to me
About how you want to be
You ought to be with me
Yeah, you ought to be with me
Thinking about what people do
Talking about how I love you
Thinking there's nothing to what they say
You're going to be with me, anyway
They don't want to see us do
All of the things we want to
You ought to be with me
Hey, you ought to be with me
You don't have to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
You can leave me now and walk away
And turn your back for another day
Oh babe, yeah, yeah
Say you ought to be the kind of girl
That can brighten this old world
And it's hard to see why you and me
Can't be together happily
I'm trying to realize
You being with some other guy
I don't know the reason why
You ought to be with me until I die
You ought to be with me until I die
I don't want to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
I want to hold you tight, love you right
Put good feelin' in your night

Excuse me, just wait one sec, have you ever really listened to a thing we've said,
You're not convinced that we could ever be a major force,
But just another youth subculture with a different song,
But for others, there's this other side,
not really looking for some credit for the things we've tried
Communication, it could work so fast,
Just 'cause now you say it's over, does that make it past
[Chorus]
We could be the new wind - oh, oh!
We could be the new wind - Do you know, do you care?
We could be the new wind - oh, oh?
We could be the new wind - Will you try, will you dare?
A simple dream, no, not just that, can you just appreciate there's something we must find,
I'm not a "punker," just a human being, with this urge to exercise,
What's in my heart and mind,
It's not me hiding, from reality, pretend that I can shine it, turn around and walk away,
The contradiction, seems to follow you, assuring that there is really nothing we can't do

Ooooohhh
Why are we fighting
Why do we scream
Seems all we do now is treat each other mean
We used to be so understadning
About each others ways
Since we've come together
Seems all we do is get in each other's way
[Chorus]
Better Friends than lovers ( so much better friends)
We used to have a ball
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
Cause we don't have to lose it all
Better friends than lovers
Honey can't you see
You need you and I need me
So its time now to set each other free
You get mad when guys stare at me
And I'm mad when girls look
I don't believe we're ready now
For living by this book
The things we love about us
Are the things we seem to hate
When we go out for good times
We just come home with big headaches
[Chorus]
We were both out there fishing
We weren't ready to care
And no room in our hearts for love
To love each other back
[Chorus]
We come home with big headaches
[Chorus]

Hold up, let me take my pants off, baby
Hold up, let you make love to me, baby
Hold up, let me take my pants off, baby
Hold up, let you be real to me, baby
Messing around again
Acting like way back when
We were just beside ourselves
With love, touching your lovely skin
Remembering feelings within
To rush the moment could be so hasty
When you taste me
Hook
Exploring the most within
If we're in love then is it sin
Pushing my thoughts into your dreams
You know what it means
Pouring your body melts
And in the morning tell me how it felt
Hope it's just as good for you
As you are to me
Hook
Me wanna love you and know you, baby
Me wanna get it up for you
Me wanna take my pants off, baby
Me wanna get loose with you
Me wanna love and know ya, baby
Me wanna take my pants off, baby
Me wanna get real nasty, baby
Can I get nasty with you, girl
Hook 3 times

does this fear stop you from living
have you thought you might be stuck
fear of the unknown
fear of whats out there
trapped inside your mind
fear of the world
fear outside
fear to live
fear of the unknown
trapped inside
by your ipod, iphone, imac, ilife
are you dead or alive
whats going on inside your mind

Everyday when I get in my car
It's a Honda, you know
I sit on down but I don't get too far
You wanna know why?
''cause I've gotta reach down
And scratch an itch
In an area, an area
That's so sensitive
So I do a
[Chorus]
Pinch and Roll [x2]
(Everybody do a) Pinch and Roll [x2]
(If you're itchy do a) Pinch and Roll [x2]
(We don't scratch, we do a) Pinch and Roll [x2]
So if you've got a problem
You know what to do
Whether you're watching TV
Or sniffing airplane glue
Which we don't do
Now the girls don't know
But us guys we all know
How to do a little dance
We call the Pinch and Roll
And we do the
[Chorus]
(Untranslatable nonsense, a sorry attempt at toasting)
(Complete jabber in a terrible Jamaican accent)
Pick it up
Now if you've got a rash
Or a minor glitch
Stick your hands on down
And give yourself a big pinch
Then you roll it around
Around and round it goes
But after you're done
Make sure you know where it goes
Not in your nose!
[Chorus]

Have I never told you I love you
Have I never told you I care
Have I never told you how much I need you
Have I ever , ever not been there
If I've never told you I care
Girl, I swear to you
It's not because the feeling's not there
I promise to you
From the top of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
Girl, don't you know
I loved you then, I love you know
And will for ever more
Have I never told you I love you
Have I never told you the words
Baby I love you (you know I love you)
Just know that I love you
Have I ever told you I miss you
Have I ever hurt your heart
Girl I never ever meant to mistreat you
Girl I could never knowingly break your heart
If I've ever caused you to feel
The words I speak straight from my heart
Are not very real
I promise to you from the tip of my heart
Through the depth of my soul
I pray that you will know
I loved you now, and I loved you then
And will for ever more
Hook
Oh baby, baby, baby you will
Always be my lady
And I promise I will
Never break your heart
'cause I love you
I need you
And will forever

I love you
Just know that I love you

Politicians talk of freedom, they talk in this country that we live in
They talk, free to be harassed and be beaten by the pigs
Your rights, no rights till you're fucking broken, crippled
Or until you're fucking dead
They pass laws unfair to gays
Their work and separatist laws to keep the non-whites in their place
Their work, family values as a smoke screen blowing in your face
Their truth, no truth, family values isn't something
That shouldn't be based on hate
Justice presides over them, late into the night
A blindfold covering their eyes but something isn't right
Under their arms, there are shackles on her legs
And the hands that once held up her scales
Are bound, are bound in chains
And behind their closed doors, they conspire through the night
More work, sick work, and they won't stop
Until this nation is all straight and all white
They call it a free nation but all it is, is a Nazi nation

Well, you've taken everything we've got
Even the guitar and the band
They were makin' the right moves
Playin' in the blues like a light is at hand
Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
Cause my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright
Don't you wanna go
Well, you've taken a right notion
Enough to fill the world and the ocean
While we're driving in your car
No one knows who you are
Let me know who, big people in power
Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
Cause my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright
New York City, don't you wanna go, c'mon
Yeah sure, climb on
Don't you wanna go, c'mon

Whatever happens
We'll have some love along the way
But it ain't easy
We'll look for some words of love to say
And smile..mmmmm
It may happen anyway
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight'
And whatever happens
They're'll be some time along the way
When it ain't easy
It just can't be sunshine everyday
We'll smile...mmmmm
And be happy, anyway
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight'
I've got you in my life
Together we can reach the higher ground
We'll be alright
Just as long as you're around
Girl, I won't let you down
Whatever happens
There'll be some good times, and some bad
But it ain't easy
Let's just remember the good times that we had
And just smile...mmmm
And be happy, anyway
And we'll kiss before we say 'goodnight' (x2)

Tonight I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna touch you, and lay you down
Tonight I'm gonna kiss you
I'm gonna taste you, all the way down
Tonight you don't have to be lonely
You need only to call me
And I will be down
When your body gets weak
And you need some affection, oh baby
I'll lay you down
When your body's in need
And you need some attention, oh lady
I'll lay you down
Tonight when I've been inside you
I'll lay down beside you, and stay all night long, yes I will
Tonight I just want you to teach me
Girl I just want to please thee
So just let's get it on, baby
Tonight there be no intermissions
I have only one mission
That's turning you on
When your body gets weak
And you need some affection, oh baby
I'll lay you down
When your body's in need
And you need some attention, oh lady
I'll lay you down
Tonight you don't have to be lonely
You need only to call me
And I will be down
When your body gets weak
And you need some affection, oh baby
I'll lay you down
When your body's in need
And you need some attention, oh lady
I'll lay you down

I'm a little old fashion
That's the way it is with me
I'm in love with one man
And I know he's feelin' me, oh yes, he is
Things are gettin' kinda serious
When there's no one else around
I ain't into shackin' up
So we gotta lock it down
Gotta put it on paper
It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
(You know I do)
There's only one thing I want you to do
(Put it on)
Put it on paper

Whoa
Now-now-now I'm an old school brother
Don't want my business in the street, no, no
What I have for this woman
Is very serious to me
She's so real
Don't wanna bring no shame
I feel so good about her
I wanna change your name
It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
(You know I love you)
There's only one thing I want you to do
(All I wanna do is)
Put it on paper

Waitin' on you, waitin' on you
It's not that I don't love you

I've fallen so deeply in love
This I can't deny, yeah
If I'm gonna share my love
I wanna do it, do it right
But wait a minute, wait a minute
I wanna respect you
And love you every, every night
The only way I can do that now and feel good
Is to make you my wife
It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
There's only one thing I want you to do
(Lets put it on)
Put it on paper

All you gotta put in on paper

It's not that I don't love you
'Cause you know that I do
There's only one thing I want you to do
Put it on paper

We all know it's like a game
Pieces of flesh involved in pain
Day after day, same old thing
Try different lives but always the same
Have the time of your lives
One more day 'till another dies
We all know it's bound to come
But who would have guessed, the other side would have won
Playing life like a movie, everone's got their role
Some make it big, the others pay the toll
Time has come to stay alive
Annihilation of our kind
The scene is dying, maybe its dead
Just another fucker you wanna kick in the head
Try to find piece of mind
Keep on trying, its hard to find
People fuck you over the first chance they get
Never trust no one, my mind is set
Believe what you will, try believing in me
I'll tyr to take you ther to make you see
Stop the bull shit, enough is enough
Try to be so hard but I called your bluff.

(No)
I remember the way you used to touch me all the time
I told you how I was the luckiest man alive
And now I hear you showin' off your new boy
And frontin' like everything's alright
I'll be damned if I let you know that I still find it hard to sleep at night
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
(Oh)
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(yeah oh)
I just keep denying till I get over you
Endless times I stayed up all night waiting for you to call
Lying to myself 'cause you weren't thinking 'bout me at all
My eyes are holding back the tears
My pride won't let you see me act a fool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let you know that I still feel something for you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Oh)
I just keep denying till I get over you
(I get over you, till I get over you, baby)
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Yeah, crying)
I just keep denying till I get over you
(Yeah, over you baby, oh)
Can't forget the way we touched
(Every day, every night, baby)
And the way we used to make love
(I still remember how it feels)
Baby, but now it's over and you're gone
(I've got to say "Goodbye")
Hey, because I know, I can't go on without you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Oh, oh)
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you

My love
Oh baby, my love
It's always been you
You make me so damn happy
I thought I knew who you were
Oh, but after twice around
I can say exactly
Of course this is love
And I never say
I didn't care about you
You sweet thing
But you can't pretend
The serious burn
That I feel in my heart, and there it's
A wedding ring, oh
I got to get over you
Its so hard
Youre my everything
Baby, when I think of us when
It's in the tea leaves
That we won't get our turn
You can't always have
What you want
You have to take the bitter
With the sweet
I'm a big girl
And I know what I want
Three nights in your arms would be
A super treat
Got to tell me baby
Got to get over you
But it's so hard
Because you're my every, everything
When I think about us when
I know it's in the tea leaves
And we won't get our turn
Oh baby
Oh baby
Hey boy
So damn happy
Babe, it's always been you
Oh baby
I'm so happy with my baby
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Yes, always with you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
I remember the moment
Yeah, baby
Yeah, boy
Forget about it
It's always been you

[Chorus]
You can call me day and night, night and day
Girl you're all that I want
I need you up around my way
We go together like a potter and clay
Girl you're all that I want
I need you up around my way
Michael Angelo would faint
Rembrandt would cry
To stand in line for a lock of your hair
I'd fly around around the world
Just to be close to you
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
[Chorus: x2]
Just tell me what I should do
Tell me what I should say
Rub me I'm your genie
Your wish is my command right away
Can we talk about it
Lady can we get together
I'm free, I'm free
Left of the sun
Right of the moon
You're hotter than the fourth of July
One taste of your sweet sweet lips
Will have me doing cartwheels and flips
Kinda shy to say that I'm sweating you
Judging by the smile on your face
Says I'm getting through
You no rush, come will the day
You come around my way
Come on
[Chorus: Repeats]

Hey you
With the hand-me-downs
Ripped up shoes and the Buster Browns
No tattoos, you don't stand out
It's all about the Lincolns in your bank account
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
High School kids do you got enough
Of all those silly monkeys who think they're tough
And teen queen babies who whine and whine
About their brand new car that works just fine
What does it matter?
It doen't matter
What does it matter?
Anti-Matter
What does it matter?
It doesn't matter
What does it matter?
Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?
Look what we do got
Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?
So what
What ever happened to my radio?
It must have happened a long time ago
Disc jockey dudes really make the scene
But did you spend a lot of money on those cool white jeans?
What does it matter?
It doen't matter
What does this matter?
Underwater
What does it matter?
It doesn't matter
What does this matter?
Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?
Look what we do got
Hey kid!
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?
When all those people
Try to hold us down
With what they got
I said, hey kids
What do we got?
Not a lot
So what?
You don't got nothing
You got nothing to lose
So what?
I'll tell you something
It's gonna be alright

Tell, tell me it isn't so
You say you have your reasons for leaving
You have to go
I watch you turn and walk away
And I'm searching to find
The right words to say
Hoping and praying you'll stay
[Chorus]
So I'll kiss your love goodbye
I guess it wasn't meant to be
I gave my all, you've tried
And now I see
The love caught my eye
I went blind
And now it makes me cry
The only thing I can do
Is kiss your love goodbye
Why, why should I look deep inside
To find where I went wrong, girl
'Cause after all, you'll still be gone
Oh how I've tried
Though I gave my best to you
You were determined to leave
And there's nothing I can do
Guess that none of my dreams won't come true
[Chorus]
I won't ask you why
(I won't ask you why)
Give me back my pride
'Cause time will mend
The heart that you've broken, baby
I'll let you go
Though I love you so
I'll find a way to kiss your love goodbye
[Chorus]
I guess it wasn't meant to be
I gave my all, you've tried
And now I see
The love caught my eye
I went blind
]Now it makes me cry
The only thing I can do
Is kiss your love
Is kiss your love
Is kiss your love goodbye
Goodbye

Let me ask you, baby
Well, do you live here everyday of your life
In a burned out war zone
Just like Beirut or something
Man it hurts my eyes
Detroit breakdown
Got my whole damn head on fire
Detroit breakdown
Ooh, what a surprise
Motown schmotown, there's nothin left
No more Iggy or the MC5
Waynes been doin it in L.A. now
So youre just livin a lie 'cause
Detroit breakdown
Got my whole damn head on fire
Detroit breakdown
Ooh, what a surprise
Let me ask you, baby
Do you live here everyday of your life?
Im a town that makes a career
Out of waiting for hell night
Detroit breakdown
Got my whole damn head on fire
Detroit breakdown
Ooh, what a surprise
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Ooh, what a surprise

Here's to Him my guardian
There He is, He moves faster than light
His body holds tremendous might
His face doth shine ever so bright
His enemies tremble with fright
Jesus is my Superhero
Once He died for me
I'm His trusting sidekick
We will beat the enemy
There he is, He labors day and night
Somehow I'm always in His sight
Without a doubt He'll do what's right
With any foe He'll win the fight
Evil's on its way
But my Savior's here to save my day

So many years that you sacrificed
So many chances you let go by
And girl never once did
you complain, no way
And now he's got nerve just to criticize
You let yourself go, like you've got no pride
You do what you do hoping he will stay
The first thing you do is put on your make up
But he doesn't notice a thing
It's not how it's s'posed to be
When men grow old
Do they lose sensitivity
When men grow old
They forget how to love
When men grow old
They have no sense of loyalty
Well if that's how it is
I don't want to grow anymore
So many nights when you sat alone
He's out with his friends like he's got no home
But you understood that he needed his space
But now it seems like that he's always gone
And he won't admit that
there's something wrong
He finds a young girl who will take your place
The first thing you do,
you go get your hair done
But he doesn't notice a thing
It's not supposed to be that way
[Hook]
Time after time
Year after year
So many women are drowning in tears
Waiting and hoping and praying for love
Something that most men don't
know the true meaning of
Why can't they just open their hearts,
don't they fall in love

A summer love is beautiful
But it's not enough
To satisfy emotions
That are shared between us
A winter love is cozy
But I need so much more
It just intensifies my wants
To have a love that endures
Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are
[Chorus]
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
An autumn love is special
At this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone
Does that love disappear
I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart
I know my love's lasting
Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

We people who are darker than blue
Are we gonna stand around this town
And let what others say come true?
We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish, grown up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
We people who are darker than blue
This ain't no time for segregatin'
I'm talking 'bout brown and yellow two
High yellow girl, can't you tell
You're just the surface of our dark deep well
If your mind could really see
You'd know your color the same as me
Pardon me, brother, as you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Get yourself together, learn to know your side
Shall we commit our own genocide
Before you check out your mind?
I know we've all got problems
That's why I'm here to say
Keep peace with me and I with you
Let me love in my own way
Now I know we have great respect
For the sister, and mother it's even better yet
But there's the joker in the street
Loving one brother and killing the other
When the time comes and we are really free
There'll be no brothers left you see
We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true
We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish, grown up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
Pardon me, brother, while you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Pardon me, brother, I know we've come a long, long way
But let us not be so satisfied for tomorrow can be an
An even brighter day

The future has arrived
The future's arrived
Nobody can doubt
The future is what everything's about
It's better for you and its better for me
It's better than what everybody thought it would be
The future has arrived
The future has arrived today
The future's alive
Alive as can be
Just open your eyes it's as plain to see
Just don't be afraid
Just keep going on
One step at a time and you can't go wrong
It's time to create
Time to grow
If you're feeling right
The world
Yeah she's changing
Don't it make you feel alive?
The future has arrived

The future has arrived today

My friends tell me
That he's been cheating on you
And that he treats you unkindly
He's using you
My friends tell me
That he keeps messing around
And that your love is so blinded
You think that it's it cool
Well, he never sends you roses
He never kisses you goodnight
He never thinks about your anniversary
He says he don't have time
Well, I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use
[Chorus:]
What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty
What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty
My friends tell me
That he's been bragging about
All of the girls that he's doing
All over town
My friends tell me
He's putting you down
And you're so in love you can't tell
He is turning you out
Well, he never sends love letters
He never takes you out at night
He never wines and dines your heart
He says he don't have time
Well, I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

Father of lights
You delight in your children

Comes from you
Every good and perfect gift
Comes from you
Father of lights
Father of lights
You never change
You have no turning
Father of lights
You never change
You have no turning

Face our fears all through the years
Now I know there are no more tears
Love's is a beautiful thing
Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire

Hold me, hold me for the good times

Here I am
Beautiful, beautiful, it's a beautiful thing
Don't let nobody change your mind
It's a beautiful thing

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last
Now romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right next time
That's the end of me
My name is not susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about susan
She got nothin' on me
So show some respect
For the love you receive
Get it right
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me boy
Hook
I never wanna be the girly
That you call one and only
You know the kind of girly
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name
Well anyway
Hook
Don't wanna hear about susan
Hook 3 times

Before the sun goes down
I will love you
You drive me crazy babe
But I will love you until the end
And I can be
I can play
I can fight
I don't care
I wanna be with You
Don't leave me alone
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
You are, all I need in this world
I have to take my eyes off You
Before my heart gets stuck in your moves
Wherever you will go
Whenever I should go
You must be
In my arms again
The awful truth is I need you here
The way you look at me when we fight
Sometimes It hurts so much
I am not done
It's no time
To finish here
What we had
I wanna be with you
As long as I can
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
You are, all I need in this world
I have to take my eyes off You
Before my heart gets stuck in your moves
Wherever you will go
Whenever I should go
You must be
In my arms again
The awful truth is I need you here
I just wanna be with you
It is crazy but it is true
And everything I will do
Before you Go
Before you stay
I should pay for my mistakes
I have never meant to hurt you girl
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you

Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
In the corridor on a wall
Underneath the staircase in the hall
On a hook behind the door
In the closet, on the floor
In the cupboard on a shelf
In the basement in the dark
Oh, anywhere, see if there's
A place for me in your heart
'Cause I've been wanting you, needing you
Having you, waiting for the door to your heart
To swing open, to swing open
To swing open so that I can come on in
Let me in
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
In the corridor on a wall
Underneath the staircase in the hall
On a hook behind the door
In the closet, on the floor
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
In the cupboard on a shelf
In the basement in the dark
Anywhere, won't you see that
Just one little
Place for me in your heart
'Cause I've been wanting you, needing you
And loving you, waiting for the door to your heart
To swing open, to swing open
To swing open so that I can come on in
Let me in, let me in
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
In your heart, anywhere
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?
Why don't you open the
Door to your heart and let me in?

Yeah, the sky is so much bluer now
Since you came into my life girl
The sun shines so much brighter now
Since you opened up my eyes, girl
Yeah, everything in my life is sweeter, sweeter
And it's all because of you
Yeah, you make everything in my life much sweeter, sweeter
Got me sayin', yeah, yeah

In the rolling night
In the stardust of a pale moon light
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams
I walk alone through the shady streets
Listening to my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
And we were born in time
Just when I thought you were gone
You came back
Just when I regretted to receive you
You were smooth, you were rough
You were more and enough
Ah babe, why did I believe it
I believe it in the rising curve
And the ways of nature will test every nerve
I took you close and got what I deserved
And we were born in time
Just when I knew who to thank
You went blank
Just as the firelight was gleaming
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, and you were plain
Oh babe, can it be you've been scheming
Well I'd really be in the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You're still so deep inside of me
And we were born in time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original version:
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You're comin' thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams
You're blowing down the shaky street
You're hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time
Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It's revealing
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reelin' with this feelin'
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won't get anything you don't deserve
Where we were born in time
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire
Is still smokin'
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken
In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what's left of me
Where we were born in time

And so the time has finally come!
The bourgeoisie has signed the war decree with proletariat blood!
And that blood which flows from their pen
Is the closest that they've ever been to the people!
You've been to our shows!
You've sung our songs!
Now we're asking you to add to each chorus you've sung and...
Protest!... Against!... Injustice!... State terror!...
On the streets of the world for the disempowered!
You've sung at our shows,
Cheered right over wrong.
Now it's time to hit the streets,
Back up those words you've sung!
Because our voices alone this time will not get it done...
Looking to stop a rogue regime?
Well the first one that we must confront is Washington, D.C.!
The Bush "terror war:" unconstitutional, unconscionable!
We refuse to let him kill, in our name, for oil!
We know their game,
Know they're corrupt!
It's up to us to hit the streets -- time to take our rights back!
Protest!... Against!... Injustice!... State terror!...
On the streets of the world for the disempowered!
You've sung at our shows,
Cheered right over wrong!
Now it's time to hit the streets,
Back up those words you've sung!
Because our voices alone this time will not get it done...
Because the people, united will get it done!
Protest!... Against!... Injustice!... State terror!...
On the streets of the world for the disempowered!
Protest!... Against!... Injustice!... State terror!...
On the streets of the world for the disempowered!
Protest!... Against!... Injustice!... State terror!...
On the streets of the world for the disempowered!
Protest!... Against!... Injustice!... State terror!...
On the streets of the world for the disempowered!

I bet I know your day
Bet you left for work 'bout ten minutes late
You didn't even wear the dress I bought
Didn't eat at our favorite spot baby
You found a new place uum
So I'm sittin' here at the same time
Pickin' up the pieces you left behind
Oh now God know that I miss your face
Can't help but wonder what it takes baby
To get back in your life girl
How often do you think of me
How often do I enter your mind girl
Is there ever a time
How often do you cry for me
I cry for you like all the time
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
Your mind, your mind
Girl what we had was so strong
That's why it lasted so long yeah
You couldn't find yourself a better man
That's why I just don't understand dear
Why you're not here girl

We were wrong to let things go
I need to know you still love me

I heard Jesus smoked weed
I heard Jesus smoked weed
Was the holy man from Galilee
Well i heard jesus smoked weed
No place to call home not a thing to eat
JC and his apostles loved to chief
They roamed around the land and tried to teach
Preached about the gospel and THC
Now all the little kids is smoking weed
They all be swinging stoned and free
Why is all the children toking trees?
'Cause they all heard that Jesus smoked weed!

What do you mean when you say
We've changed our ways?
Say we're just too political,
Or we don't have much to say.
The ones who criticize our reasons,
Always seem to disagree.
No matter what we do,
It's them we just can't seem to please.
(Chorus)
Forgot the things we've said,
We're only clones.
Not cool enough to make it on our own.
Judged by the elitist chosen few.
Their labels aren't for me,
Are they for you?
You say some years ago our songs were fine.
And our debut EP was just divine,
But now a shadow haunts us through and through
And songs we wrote before you never knew
(Repeat Chorus)

The ideal for the practical
The exchange: freedom for truth
The path you set out on...
Someone will finish it
But it will not be you
(Why don't you fly? Why aren't you alive?)
'Cause you're a Dead Duck
You dug the hole that you've fallen into
Your lost hopes and Broken Dreams
Fallen away, should have fallen asleep
Dark is your path, can't see what stumbles your feet
Seduced by the times you who once were an heir
Our joys should all be doubled and our trials be shared
(If I saw you cry, would you too want me to die?)
You are not alone it seems

Mass halucination on the ballroom floor
and an ancient rite of passage on the shit house door
you keep stealing all my cigerettes
and your whiskey breath
is drowning out the words you're saying
but go ahead, get 'em off your chest
And I feel it in the marrow of my lazy bones
your on to something better
and there's always someone better
Did I drag you down
Did I drag you down
Don't let me drag you down here to my level
that ain't no good
that ain't no good
that ain't no good
Well here I go again
you've heard it all before
but I only caught a glimpse
can I see a little more?
they give it all and give it up
it ain't never enough
when you're deaf and dumb and blind with love
And I can see down to the bottom of your big blue eyes
You're on to something better
and there's always someone better
Did I drag you down
Did I drag you down
Don't let me drag you down here to my level
that ain't no good
that ain't no good
that ain't no good

May not know enough about you, babe
That can only come in time
Only know enough to make you stay
On my mind
Though I met you only yesterday
And only for a moment then
I knew I couldn't let you get away
I just can see you, girl
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
Can't say I can't live without you, babe
That's just some worn out loser's line
May not know enough about you, babe
But you stay on my mind
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart
Try to find a place for me
I can be the one you love
Let me be the one you need
Take a look into your heart

Love and devotion
That's what I give you
Honest emotions
That's what I feel
Fire and desire
Whenever I'm near you
My love comes down
And I want to love you
Wherever you go
I want to hold you
Never let go
I want to love you girl
I want you close and I want you right now
Oh girl
Love and affection
That's what I bring you
A heart full of passion
And girl it's for real
No pain is pleasure
I promise to reasure
And love you down
And I want to love you
Wherever you go
I want to hold you
Never let go
I want to love you girl
I want you close and I want you right now
Oh girl
Baby baby baby
And I want to love you
Wherever you go
I want to hold you
Never let go
I want to love you girl
I want you close and I want you right now
Oh girl
And I want to love you
Wherever you go
I want to hold you
Never let go
I want to love you girl
I want you close and I want you right now
Oh girl

Wearing braces, the red, white, and blue
Doing what he thinks he ought to do
Used to be a punk and a mod too
Or is it just a phase he's going through
[Chorus]
He's a Clockwork skinhead
Just a clockwork skinhead
Clockwork skinhead - got no choice
He's a Clockwork skinhead
Just a clockwork skinhead
Clockwork skinhead - One of the boys
Take him to the pub, buy him a beer
Tell him what he wants to hear
Wind him up like clockwork toy
Wants to be a man but he's just a boy
[Chorus]

no words to this song

Look out, look out

This place is taking all my self esteem
And everybody is afraid of me
And I can't make eye-contact with anyone I see
This place is taking all my self esteem
And everybody is afraid of me
And I'm afraid to go out in the streets
Reminders of my failures everywhere that I will be
Everybody is afraid of me
People freak me out
People make me scared
People make me so damn self-aware
I get bronchitis twice a year at least
My lungs aren't the way that they should be
And I smoke more than a motherfucking chimney
I declare war on my body

Your love's so exciting
Boy i can't deny it
Since you found a place in my heart
Givin' me a feeling
Ooh it's such a feeling
I pray that we never will part
How can i explain it
Please hear what i'm sayin'
You bring so much so much joy to my life
Words cannot express
So much happiness
I'll forever be by your side
[Chorus]
And i will give you my heart
And i will always be true to you
And i will love you forever
If i could just make love to you
Make love to you
Girl i must confess it
You've been such a blessing
Never felt so good in my life
You know how to take it
I know how to give it
We both always have a good time
I hear what you're sayin'
Lord knows you ain't playin'
Ain't no doubt that i'm satisfied
And i'll keep it comin'
Keep bringin' the lovin'
So baby bring your lovin'
Every morning, noon, and night
[Chorus: x 2]
Oh give me just a minute and
I'll jump right on in it
We can make love under the stars
All year pleasure pleasure
I'll be yours forever
Girl, i'll never leave now
I'll be there to please you
We won't have to worry at all
[Chorus: x 3]
I will go all the way down
I'll make it feel so good
I want to do you right
If i could just make love to you
[Chorus: x 2]

I can't remember
The last time I felt this way
You're keeping a smile on my face
You know exactly how I tick
Every time I light the wick
Seems like you're ready to explode
I want you to know
You got the bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb, bomb
Just keep on blowin' me up
You got the bomb, bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb, bomb, blowin' me up
I recall
The first time I kissed your lips
(Think I'm gonna shout about it)
(Baby, there's no doubt about it)
Whenever you want me, girl, I'm there
Whatever the time, girl I don't care
I got no place to go
Baby, I know
You got the bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb, bomb
Just keep on blowin' me up
You got the bomb, bomb
Just can't get enough
You got the bomb, bomb, blowin' me up

Say you've seen too many things
That turned out to be too good to be true
Against your better judgment opened up your heart
Till you found the joke was on you
Looking out on the rest of our lives
If we're gonna be together or apart
About the only way that I know how to come
Is right straight from my heart
I want you now, I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around, but now I've found
That you're the only one for me
You say you'll never fall again
You won't subject yourself to such pain
But if you give me half a chance I'll win
I'll never leave you standing out in the rain
But if you think that I can look you in the face
And lie right through my teeth
Then turn around and walk away
But cross my heart girl I care for you
When I look into your eyes and I say
I want you now, I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around, but now I've found
That you're the only one for me
I need you so, I can't let go
Gonna be all that I can be
I want you still, I always will
'Cause you're the only one for me
I want you now, I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around, but now I've found
That you're the only one for me
I need you so, I can't let go
I'm gonna be all that I can be
I want you still, I always will
'Cause you're the only one for me

I remember how you used to wait by the phone
Counting every minute that I was gone
And you used to call me sweet things in the morning light
After you would hug me so tender
Each and every night
Lately you got so much to do
And your never at home
By the time I get to see you
You need your time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you
But I need to know
[Chorus]
Is this the way love goes
Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way love goes
Staring at a photograph of you and I inframed
When I blink my eyes you start to fade away
Oh, I recall that day in fall and all the things you said
All of the promises that you never kept
Lately you got so much to do
And you're never at home
When I finally get to see you
You need you're time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you
But I need to know
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Everybody needs to a love they can count on
I'm the kind of man who needs to know exactly where I stand
Stayin' up late at night I'm wondering
How we can make it right
Never gonna say goodbye
I'm crying
Find a way to make it right

I'm gon' put it out there,
Lay it on the line,
And even if it breaks my heart,
I'm giving it a try.
Not waiting for tomorrow,
Confessing it today,
So baby, here it goes,
I'm out of time,
It's do or die.
I wanna be your baby,
Wanna be your man,
I wanna be your soldier,
When you're too weak to stand.
I wanna be your baby,
Be the end of your day,
Forever in your life,
And ever by your side,
Forever I'll stay.
I'm hanging on a thread here,
I don't care if I fall,
But I ain't gonna foe,
Even though,
I don't know,
If you feel me at all.
I'm ready to be right, or wrong, with you.
I'm ready for my heart, to win, or lose.
I'm ready to give all I've got to you,
Girl I want you to know.
I wanna be your baby,
Wanna be your man,
I wanna be your soldier,
When you're too weak to stand.
I wanna be your baby,
Be the end of your day,
Forever in your life,
And ever by your side,
Forever I'll stay.
So I'm saying I love you,
Ain't holding nothing back.
And I'm saying I want you babe,
I hope you don't mind that.
I'll wait on you forever,
And girl I promise that.
Oh baby,'cause I love you,
I love you babe,
I love you.
I wanna be your baby,
Wanna be your man,
I wanna be your soldier,
When you're too weak to stand.
I wanna be your baby,
Be the end of your day,
Forever in your life,
And ever by your side,
Forever I'll stay.
I wanna be your baby,
Wanna be your man,
I wanna be your soldier,
When you're too weak to stand.
I wanna be your baby,
Be the end of your day,
Forever in your life,
And ever by your side,
Forever I'll stay.
I wanna be,
I wanna be,
I need to be,
I got to be.

Detroit City
It was the finest in this world
Yes, Detroit City
It was the finest in this world
I'm crazy 'bout that city
And I love its pretty girls
When you leave that city
And you feel this kind of love
When you leave that city
And you feel this kind of love
Just one goes out hasty
And you find a good place to go
You don't need a lot of money
To have a real good time
You don't need a lot of money
To have a real good time
Just be a real good sport
And everything will turn out fine

See you out there, it's like you'll dance the night away,
But the feelings aren't too good because you need to lead the way,
You call them friends, but now to you they have no air to breath,
And when the time is right you know you'll have to have the final say
[Chorus]
Music makes you feel good, so why make it a drag,
Too boots, the fist, the stance, you're out to win a loser's game,
How hard is it, to take them, when size is on your side,
Too blind to see, it's just a shame, when music's played in vain,
Big man with mean face now, are you bigger than you seem,
Find time to push around, and bring it down, until there's nothing left
Our music and our message, out of love more than exists
Are you there to hear it stop now, are you there to see it end
[Chorus]

Watch your right
Watch your left
Watch the right
Watch the center
And watch your back
Hey
Okay, its on the radio, its on the TV news
Conservatives and liberals, with ever clashing views
But as the days go by I cant tell which side is talkin'
Their left is in the center and labeled 'Liberal Doctrine'
They do nothin' for you
They do nothin' for me
No they give us nothin' to believe
Yeah
Watch your right
Watch your left
Watch the right
Watch the center
And watch your back
Watch your right
Watch your left
Watch the right
Watch the center
And watch your back
Let the Fed's pass a law, that takes your rights away
'Cause, you gotta sacrifice if you want to stay safe
'Til the day you find the Fed's in your back pocket
Lockin' you away for sayin', Question, Think, or Stop It
They do nothin' for you
They do nothin' for me
No they give us nothin' to believe
Yeah
Watch your right
Watch your left
Watch the right
Watch the center
And watch your back
Watch your right
Watch your left
Watch the right
Watch the center
And watch your back
Joseph McCarthy and Reagan, set the motherfuckin stage
For the right leanings that now grip the U.S.A.
They framed and jailed the Reds, lost the keys to the cell
Set up the capitalist machine to go in for the kill
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Social divisions, encouraged by the few
(Few)
Those few in power, suckerin suckers like you
(You)
As corporate welfare, flows from troughs of the state
(State)
Yeah big business, takes more than their fair take
(Take)
But in the end it is suckers like you
(You)
Who buy that the poor, are givin you the screw
(Screw)
Dont you realize that its just talk, talk, talk, talkin'
Like tax men at your door, fuckin, knockin knockin knockin
Watch your right
Watch your left
Watch the right
Watch the center
And watch your back
Watch your right

All I need
Is someone like you
My dearest darling
Please love me to
Within my heart
I pray your answer's yes
I'll make your life
Full of happiness
I'll be there by your side
Oh,I pledge my love to you
With God as our guide
Unh, my dearest darling

Unh, my dearest darling

You go right, I'll go left
Sometimes we don't agree
But that's okay 'cuz in the end
We're still brothers, you and me
We'll go to Steak 'N' Shake sometimes
'Cuz we hang out every night
And we do the same ol' thing
Sometimes we fool around too much
'Cuz we are a frisky bunch
We get in trouble everyday
Hey! Ho! Straight through the heart
I'm for you and I know you're there for me
Give me a high 5!
Hey! Ho! Friends till the end
Can't you see that's the way it's got to be?
You're the money and the bomb
But I talk about your mom
Even though it isn't right
Go to Mikey's, play some games
Stay up till the break of day
Maybe get into a fight
Even though we're hittin' 20
And we haven't yet matured
You know I think it's kinda funny
That we're all a bunch of nerds
Can't you see God has destined us to be?

I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
Take this anyway you want to
but don't expect me to be there when you crash and burn
I've got a closet full of demons
and you're just another waiting to break free
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my life
I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
I knew who I was this morning
but that's changed so many times since then
These are the nights we will remember
and I'll hold onto that till the day I die
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my life, fuck!
I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
I don't see any other way
for you to get out of this mess and
this town is a loaded gun
with its sights on you
and you can't get out of here
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my
This is the last time I kiss this city goodbye
it's the first time I get on with my life

Wild and free is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for those people
Power to the people
Setting down the old crew
Bringing in the brand new
Wild and free with peace finally
Wild and free is the way I want my life
Natures wait for me
Without pain in its stride
Fighting what is wrong
Across the world as well as home
But respect for everybody's right
Would be really out of sight
Our great obligations
Would not be bad situation
If the young what we listen to
For what they really know is true
Respect for those people
Power to the people
The old people who worry 'bout me
'Cause I am so wild and free
Wild and free is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for those people
Power to the people

Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you
I bought a house, a diamond ring
I had to give up everything
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you
I stopped my rambling, I even stopped gambling
And I stopped staying out all night
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you
I tried so hard to do what's right
But you only wrecked my life
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

Just out of Monday
I run into a friend
Down the street, down the street
Where I live
Sad things begin
I could feel from within
From the message, from the message
He had to give
About a buddy of mine
He run out of time, his life run out of time
Somebody past noon, shot across the room
And now the man no longer lives
Too bad about him
Too sad about him
Don't get me wrong, the man is gone
But it's a wonder, he lived this long
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was an alley cat
Ah, didn't care nothing about being black
Oh, Billy Jack
There can't be no fun, can't be no fun
To be shot, shot with a hand gun
Your body sprawled out, you without a doubt
Running people out, there on the floor
Sad bloody mess
Shot all up in his chest, shot in his chest
One sided duel, gun and a fool, ah
What a way to go
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was a alley cat
Ah, didn't care nothin' 'bout being Black
Oh, Billy Jack

Could I be the one that you're thinking of
My goal is to be the one you're dreaming of
I wanna be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Trust me and I'll never let you down
Let me be with you through all your hard times
I wanna be around when the ?
It'll be me and you, I can see our position
Can't you see our love shinning through?
You've been there to solve all of my problems
You've been there to help me solve them
I don't know what, I don't know what you do to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Could I be the one?
Trust me with your dreams, I'll make them all come true
For the rest of my life, I'll be grateful to you
Time will pass, our love will last
I'll spend my life cherishing you
Let me be the one
Let me be the one in your life at the end of the rainbow
Let me be the one
Let me be the one that you love so
Late at night, the time is right
I wanna be the one you just think is out of sight
Let me be the one
Let me be the one, let you be the girl
Let me be the one
Let me be, let me be the one at the end of the rainbow
Oh, I'll never, never, never, let you done
Let me be the one, let me be the one
Oh, talk to me girl, let me be the one, be the one, oh yeah
At the end of the rainbow, I'll never, never, never let you down
Let me be the one, let me be the one

the world is evil, we're all goin to hell
my glass is half empty I don't feel so well
a pessimist from the very start
negative emotions fill my heart
but when I see your pretty face
it's hard to hate the human race
just whisper softly in my ear
I love you more with each passing year
I wanna go to mexico
when I think about you (when I think about you)
when I think about you (when I think about you)
when I think about you (when I think about you)

And I was burnin' like a forest fire
Yeah, I was burning like gasoline, lit
When I heard the things you said
Drown out the things you did
than I thought of your neck,
thought of your beautiful blue eyes
While the police gas suffocated our lungs
but not our insides
and than that protest sign
it came to my mind
when we were young we never could have known that,
never could have known that
this world would be so cold
Set up; knock down our souls
Our innocense would be forever stole

If you want to save some trouble in your life

When I was a boy I used to live in corduroy
OP shirts and slip-on Vans.
My life was so simple
I had not one pimple,
My everyday was made up of these plans:
To ride my bike to Thrifty's,
Run past the balls and ice cream and
find the Star Wars figurines.
Thinking of my action men,
Kung-Fu grip and all,
What happened to them all?
[Chorus]
Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone?
Now that we're all older
Before we grow much colder
Let's all look forward to the new dawn
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll stand together and sing this song
We'll sing this song
It's not too long
So everybody sing along
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
Take me back to my happy land
Now my brothers and sisters
I don't mean to make a scene
But I lost my action figures
and it makes me want to scream
Greedo, Chewbacca, Luke, R2, and Han,
3PO, Yoda, Bobafett, Obi Wan
Green Machine, Suckerman
Silly Putty, Lincoln Logs
Sitting in my Underoos
Reading christmas catalogs
What happened to my action men and all?
What happened to it all?
Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone?
Now that we're all older
Before we grow much colder
Let's all look forward to the new dawn
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll stand together and sing this song
We'll sing this song
It's not too long
So everybody sing along
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land
Take me back to my happy land

Feels good, everybody
Tender lover, tender love
Eleanor Rigby
Spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go
Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time
Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart
Don't ever give up
In spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep lookin' for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want
Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time
[Hook]
My tender lover
Tender lover, tender love
Tender lover, tender love
Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
If you got a woman that's cold
9 times outta 10 she can't be stole
If you got a woman that's hot as fire
You can wave your woman bye-bye
If she's hot she knows she's hot
Then you can't please her with what you got
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
If you gotta woman that's hard to get
9 times outta 10 the lil' girl'll stick
If you gotta woman that talks to every man that hits
When you get home she might done split
If she listens to them long enough
You can wave bye-bye to your good good stuff
('Cause)
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
(I say)
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
If you gotta woman that don't like to laugh and grin
Aw buddy, she'll stay with you until the end
But if you gotta woman that likes to flirt
You can call your family doctor buddy 'cause you bout to get hurt
If you got a woman that can't count her fingers and toes
It's no telling how many men have seen exposed
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman
Cold women with warm hearts is my kind of woman

Whoa, yes, it's me
And I'm walking in the rain
I'm looking for my baby
Her name is Ida Jane
And if she don't come back today
I'll give her prayers away
The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart
Because Ida Jane
Has broken my heart
And if she don't come back today
I'll give her prayers away
I believe I'm losing
I'm losing my mind
Because Ida Jane
She can't be found
And if she don't come back today
I'll give her prayers away
The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart
Since me and Ida Jane
Have been apart

Sometimes we wish for the better
When we have it good as it gets
Sometimes the grass isn't greener
Soon as we find out we forget
Sometimes the fool doesn't know he's a fool
Sometimes a dog he don't know he's a dog
Sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really don't mean it all
Sometimes a man
Is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse
It's just how it is
Sometimes the wrong
Don't know that they're wrong
Sometimes the strong
Ain't always so strong
Sometimes a girl
Is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you
So girl I'm sorry for the stupid things I wish I didn't do but I do
Oh so sorry, oh no, oh so sorry
Sometimes I wish I was smarter
Wish I was a bit more like you
Not making stupid decisions made at the last minute
You live to regret when it's through
Well, sometimes the fool doesn't know he's a fool
And sometimes a dog he don't know he's a dog
Sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really didn't mean it all
Sometimes a man
Is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse
It's just how it is
Sometimes the wrong
Don't know that they're wrong
Sometimes the strong
Can't always be strong
Sometimes a girl
Is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you
So girl I'm sorry for the stupid things I wish I didn't do but I do
Sometimes the fool doesn't know he's a fool
Sometimes a dog he don't know he's a dog
Sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really didn't mean it at all, at all
Sometimes a man
Is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse
It's just how it is
Sometimes the wrong
Don't know that they're wrong
Sometimes the strong
Ain't always so strong

Is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you
So girl I'm sorry for the stupid things I wish I didn't do but I do

First a boy and a girl meet each other
Then they sit down to talk for a while
In your heart, you'll want her for a lover
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
You may start with a simple conversation
My darling, please put me on trial
She says, yes and your heart starts beating
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
You ask her if she loves you she answers, "I do"
Your heart starts glowing inside
And then you will know she is just for you
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
Then you put a ring on her finger
And the tears start flowing awhile
Then you'll know she's yours forever
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle

See them on the TV screen, looking back with electric eyes;
Razorblades and vaseline; what I see is synthesized.
Photographs and magazines will accept no compromise;
Radio and nicotine, all of them are synthesized.
Synthesized. Synthesized.
Every day now, more and more, names and faces obsolete.
See the movement on the floor; always listen to the beat.
One by one, ____ __ ____ stream, every movement synchronized,
Dancing like they're in a dream; everything is synthesized.
Synthesized. Synthesized.
Calling cards and catalogs sacrificed for their disguise;
Disconnecting analogs, anything to synthesize.
Nothing here is what it seems, nothing ____ will be recognized;
Perfect fit for the Machine: everyone is synthesized.
Synthesized. Synthesized. Synthesized. Synthesized.

Every time I'm with you darling
A fever comes over me, oh yeah
And there's a burning deep inside
That just won't let me be, oh no
I tried to be patient baby
But I just can't stand the pain, oh no
And there's no time like right now darling
While we're alone again
The feeling is right
And the time is right now
Now you say it, the feeling is right
I got to have your love
My desires won't wait forever darling
My willpower's growing weak, oh yeah
And I can't fill this need inside
With promises you won't keep, oh no
So put away your childish ways
And let the woman in you shine, oh yeah
And let a good thing come between us girl
Get down with this love of mine
The feeling is right
And the time is right now
Oh the feeling is right
I got to have your love
I said the feeling is right
And the time is right now
Sometime you make me feel like

Sunrise
Sunset
Since the beginning it hasn't changed yet
People fly high begin to lose sight
You can't see very clearly when you're in flight
It's high time that you found
The same people you misuse on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
Vintage wines from the year '62
It's your thing, it's your thing
It pleases you
You got to frown when you cross town
You think it's an honor just to have you around
It's high time that you found
The same dudes you misuse on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
You think the sun rises and sets for you
But the same sun rises, sets and shines
On the poor folks too
I don't mind you turning round
I myself would even like a little higher ground
It's high time that you found
The same people you walk on on your way up
You might meet up
On your way down
On your way down

I'm waiting for my man
26 dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 125
Feel sick and dirty
more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man
Hey white boy, what you doing uptown
Hey white boy, you chasing our women around
Oh, pardon me, sir, it's furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
P.R. shoes and and big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man
Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split
Because you've got no time to waste, ah
I'm waiting for my man

I thought I'd begun to see a change
But the more things change
The more they stay the same
Back stabbing and name calling
The trade marks of your act
You talk and talk of unity
But divide with your attacks
I'd like to see a change, I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy
Tearing everyone down, tearing everyone down, stop
And all us kids, we try to make a change
Some kids start a band, others start a zine
You, no matter what your path
You throw a curve in what could be achieved
Then give up and move onto some other thing
I'd like to see a change, I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy
Tearing everyone down, tearing everyone down
Take a break from your fights
Try to open up your mind tonight
When you feel that's complete
We can tackle this society
You may not like everything in life I do
But that doesn't mean, I'm not trying to change
The same problems as you
I'd like to see a change, I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy, come on
Tearing everyone down, tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down, down, down, down, down, down
Tearing everyone down, down, down, down, down, down
Tearing everyone down

Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure
Makes will power weak and temptation strong
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man
They say that it's a man's world
Well you can improve that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man

Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
Verse 1
We were too young
To know what this means
And we, we were too dumb
To let ourselves believe
And we stood by sides
We thought that we'd recognise
And we, could draw lines
But it cuts reality too fine
Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Go back in time
It was intentional
We had our hearts full, of life
Verse 2
It was too soon
To break down walls we'd built
And it, it wasn't true
Or fair to throw all of the guilt
And now, now it's too late
To back-track on what's done
We won't hesitate
We'll burn brighter than the sun
Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Go back in time
It was intentional
We had our hearts full, of life
Instrumental
Chorus
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Change the world in little time
What were we thinking that we'd
Turn the darkness into light
What were we thinking that we'd
Go back in time
It was intentional
We had our hearts full, of life

Why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why do I hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad
My life's been better since the day you left boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did things I said I would do boy
I found someone who loves me for me
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me thru
Leaving you has been the best thing for me
Hook
Never again that's what I said to myself
I never wanna feel your kinda pain again boy
Just when I think it's over
Just when I think it's thru
I find myself right back in love with you

He was a king without a crown
Thy hanged him on on his throne
And nailed him in the ground
The prophet, he upon the tree,
Sacrificed himself for the whole world to see
He bled for you, he bled for me
On that day, that day on Calvary
It was a day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
It was for real
Upon the hill
The Savior gave his life
So you and I might live
He had to die
To pay redemption's price
It was the only day the angels ever cried
He died for you, he died for me
The lonely road on his way to Calvary
It was the day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
Then came Sunday morning
The angels sang and the stone it rolled away
It was the day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
So wipe your weeping eyes
'Cause he died for you and I
And he's coming back again
So every time we sin

Astrid was from a planet blue
He spoke of love for me and you
He could set your mind ablaze
With sparkling eyes and visionary care
He stood like a remnant from an outbreak past
Wore a ring in his ear and boy was he fast
Had hair like a rocket's nest
But when he cheered he gave his best
He made a noise that stirred our souls
Got us moving out of control
When Astrid moved he changed our tunes
They filled his arms with needles bare
Shot him up and cut his hair
Tied him to an evil plot
Told the kids that he was not
their man
He gave us life and dealt us love
Sold us out for the great above
On a starry night in mid-December
Astrid died you might remember
Live it to the end
Share it with a friend
Deny me not
Cause now you're caught
I'll be with you in the thought
Beyond

Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why you keep dissin' me
Poor little me
And why you have a change of heart
And turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me
But don't you know
I could be a trip
I could make things hard
But baby I believe that you still got a heart
That's why i
Try to stop myself before I start
'cause I could make it tough
I could make it rough
But I won't
Well I'll be givin' you the benefit
Of the doubt
Givin' you a minute to
Try to work it on out
I'll be givin' you the benefit
Of the doubt
And I'm givin' you a minute to
Try to work it on out
Baby, work it on, work it on out
Work, work, work
Baby, work it on, work it on out
Work, work, work
Baby how could you be hangin' out on the town
And claim that you missin' me
Poor little me
When you knew all the time
That you could've been with your homegirl
Lovin' and a kissin' on me
Sweet little me
But don't you know
If you wanna be a man
You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel I'm like your number one and
Nothin' in the world should make us part
Cause we can make it work
If you take away the hurt
From the heart

It's an evil wind that blows no good, yeah
It's a sad heart that won't love like I know it should
Oh how lonesome(oh how lonesome) you must be (you must be)
It's a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share your love with me
It's a heartache, yeah (it's a heartache)
When love is gone (baby it's a heartache)
But it's bad (bad) and even sad (sad) oh later on
And there's no one blinder than you won't see
It's a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share some of your love with me
I can't help it, oh no
He is gone
I must try to forget
Because I've got to live on
Oh it's a good thing it's a sweet thing (it's a sweet thing)
To love someone (such a sweet thing)
But it's bad (bad) and even sad (sad) when it's not returned
Oh, how lonesome, how lonesome, how lonesome (oh how lonesome)
You must be (you must be)
I tell you it would be a shame (shame, shame)
A shame if you don't share your love with me (share your love with me)
It would really be a mistake baby (shame, shame) if you don't share
Your love with me (share your love with me)
It would sure be a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share
Share your love with me (share your love with me)

You asked me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
That won't be easy you see
After all the things you've done for me
Though I'm a man, I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
Without you girl, I'm nothing at all
Like a snowman in the sun, my life was wasting away
Your love gave me hope and strength, you're the reason I'm alive today
How, I wanna know
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me
You'll always be a part of me
Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the air I breathe
I wanna know, how
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me
Girl, you'll always be apart of me
How, I wanna know
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me
You'll always be apart of me
How, how, how can I forget ya, woman
You've been so good, good baby
How can I forget ya
It's impossible to do
How can I forget ya, woman
You've been so good, good, good to me
How can I forget ya
I want to know
How can I forget ya

God must love you, I said to myself
'Cause you are more beautiful than anybody else
God must adore you, it's easy to tell
Must be wonderful to wake up to yourself
And the moment I saw you, had a vibe that's fit to kill
It was then you knew that I knew love was real
On the day I met you, you were so so true
On the day I fell in love with you, my heart stood still
And I never thought this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could feel
Yes, God must love you, He's proud of himself
When he made you girl, He broke the mold for real
There's just something about you that you can even help
It's the way you flow, you don't even know
That you got that whip of view
But the moment I first saw you, had your vibe all set to kill
It was then you knew that I knew love was real
On the day I met you, you were so, so true
On the day I fell in love with you, my heart stood still
And I never thought this happening to me
It's like something just came over me, yeah
On the day I met you, you were so, so true
On the day I fell in love with you, my heart stood still
And I never thought this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could feel, baby, yeah
Never thought, love at first sight could be real
Suddenly I see your face and I get you, baby
And everything I never thought that I could feel is for real
Love is real on the day
Oh, baby, on the day I met you, you were so, so true
On the day I fell in love with you, my heart stood still
And I never thought this happening to me
It's like something just came over me, yeah
On the day I met you, you were so, so true
On the day I fell in love with you, my heart stood still
And I never thought this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could feel
No, no, I never thought that I could feel

Daddy always told you, do it like a man, never get too friendly,
ome won't understand, friends have got you in on all those "hard" things that they've planned,
All your life they told you, never shed a tear, 'cause boys don't crave affection,
Boys ain't got no fear,
But did they ever show you how to shut those feelings on then off again
[Chorus]
And now you gotta hide yourself, hide yourself away,
Show you care and you might show the world that you're only gay,
Crying is for babies, for boys is it a sin,
To be a caring, sharing, loving, human one
Handshake show you're friendly, but don't get caught,
You gotta fight to prove you're not afraid, fuck just to prove you're not,
And all your life you play this game and it goes on and on and on and on,
Now you've grown into a man, proud as hell to be,
It's now your turn to raise a son, don't let him be one,
And you can teach him all the things you were taught yourself

As I lay me down too sleep
I pray to lord my soul too keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to lord my soul to take
My cup full I'm laid back, I'm bout mine you know that
I'm rag racing, zoom zoom, in a rush too get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, come through your hood in all black
If you real you'd recognize
All I do is grind and pray, riding through the streets all day
All I do is grind and pray, riding through these streets all day
They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause me and you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is to hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damm I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping at Onyx, keep it clapping at Magic
Got them niggas tricking at Palace
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out
And you cash in, they going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be, when income is uncertain
Hustling just too make a way, know you're thinking damn I hope
Somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
That money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if I ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers 'cedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gon' get your money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that (that body baby it's yours)
We do it big, an no together we about to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of these niggas
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

You're not alone, no
And no one's gonna hurt your heart again
And this I know, yes
You can count on me, I'll be there as your friend
For no one knows the pain that you've endured
They took the best from you
Girl, I know
You gave 'em all ya got
You tried, they played around
You cried, they let you down
You gave 'em everything you had
They treated you oh so bad
[Hook]
Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'd teach this world a lesson
And I'd never let you fall
Given a chance
It's not yuor fault
That you were born with such a trusting heart
Erase that thought
You're so beautiful, please stay the way you are
And no one understands how much it hurts
You tried to make it work
Girl I know
You gave it all you got
Don't cry, it's over now
Don't sigh, things are better now
I will give you everything you need
You can always count on me
Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'd teach this world a lesson
And I'd n-n-n-n-never let you fall
Don't cry, it's over now
Don't sigh, things are better now
I will give you everything you need
You can always count on me
Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'm gonna teach this world a lesson
And I'm n-n-n-n-never gonna let you fall

Most of this life's been a drag of a high
And lows like a blow in a paid thrown title fight
Most of my sins were born in a kiss on a night like this
Calling all lonely hearts
Don't you want a life like we saw on the picture show?
So come on, give me something, come on, keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life
My love seems that it goes from a dream
To a crash and a roll, just shaking up everyone
Maybe there's more than the treasures we secure
That become heavy chains, to sink us in tidal waves
And all I could do is take you from the circus show
So come on give me something, come on keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life
And all my nights they always end the same (with the blacktop, blacktop)
Coming from behind
It's just the age-old game from the living dead buzzing in my head
They keep me up all night
You say, my baby, all this time in between drives me crazy
I want a life on fire, going mad with desire
I don't wanna survive, I want a wonderful life
(All my sins were born in a kiss on a night like this calling all lonely hearts)
I want a wonderful life

Verse 1
Thank god, cus' i dont need this
I was smiling as i walked in
You wiped the smile right off my face
Give me a second before i begin
Verse 2
Thank god cus' i just needed
A weight to be lifted off my shoulders
Since today i have been feeling
Like i was backed down into a corners
Bridge
I'll sing you a sad song
So you can drown your sorrows
Chorus
Just wait, you'll be
A million miles away from me
When i say that i am
Feeling a whole lot better
Just wait, you'll see
That with your childish little frown
You were only bringing me down
Verse 3
Hey you i heard you needed
Something to make you smile wider
Have you heard that i have seen it
A future that is so much brighter
Bridge
I'll sing you a sad song
So you can drown your sorrows
Chorus
Just wait, you'll be
A million miles away from me
When i say that i am
Feeling a whole lot better
Just wait, you'll see
That with your childish little frown
You were only bringing me down
Middle 8 x2
So smile like you mean it
Make me believe it
I am sick of you
You think that you're a know-it-all
Pride comes before a fall
You're starting to un-do
Bridge
I'll sing you a sad song
So you can drown your sorrows
Chorus
Just wait, you'll be
A million miles away from me
When i say that i am
Feeling a whole lot better
Just wait, you'll see
That with your childish little frown
You were only bringing me down
You're only bringing me down

Hello
They've sold our their music's changed
This sold out record sounds the same
Don't criticize our hobbies
We don't criticize you for being fucking assholes
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Teenage Kennedy lobotomy
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
The Free Mumia tent was all out of Mumias

Fuck off, we're not here for help
We're clearly in this for the wealth
Okay Pat

I always wonder where you are
I'm right beside you, you're so far away
Moments you're not facing me
Moments you're not chasing me
I don't believe in good good-byes
Cause even when the roses die
There's still some thorns left in your side
It's like a funeral for the bride
And I know candy girls, yeah they just wrapped your tears
I've always been such a sucker for sweets
I need affection
All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to point your direction
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes me talk to you about affection
I need affection
Somewhere along is when I died
On the banks of some canal
Yeah the river bed of tears I tried to ride
Even fools will believe in lies
And if every word you said were true
You'd be my god and I'd just pray to you for affection
All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to make a confession
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes a man come unglued
Affection, I need affection
Why won't you dance with me
(Covered in gas you couldn't catch fire)
There's no more romance with me
(I know there's someone else burning in your eyes)
You don't think I see you
But I see right through you baby
Affection
All I want, someone's affection
All I need to, was affection
What ya do (what ya do)
What ya do (what ya do)
Where'd ya go
Affection
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And don't think I see you
I see right through you
You don't think I see you
But I do

-Mommy?
-Yes Son?
-Where does dirt come from?
-Dirt comes from: The Worms.
-Wow! Awesome!
There is a chipmunk
At the center of the earth
And in his big oven
He bakes his own desserts
He warms the ocean
And from that, life springs forth
Little organisms building trash around the clock
Compost heaps
Or melting pots
For Farmer John's
Smoked Sausage stocks
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And all of the roots have a place to sleep now
All the chanuks have squash to eat now
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And people hold hands and feel terrific
Food comes from dirt
It's scientific
Yeah! Wow!
There's so much to learn!
The Sun came from a cave
And it made the clouds go by
(Hi!)
The clouds had a conference
And rain fell from the sky
(Wow!)
Worms got thirsty
From eating too much dirt
(Yeah!)
They came up through the ground
And got eaten by the birds
(Huh?)
Some worms escaped
With their lives
(Oh boy!)
They excreted soil
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And all of the roots have a place to sleep now
All the chanuks have squash to eat now
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And people hold hands and feel terrific
Food comes from dirt
It's scientific
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE IS AWESOME!
AWESOME!
Worms make dirt

Yeah, you do drugs, you know I don't,
Yet it's a trend just 'cos I don't,
Leave me be, can't you see,
I hate the way it fuckin' smells.
I hate the way it makes me feel.
Thumbs down to all those drugs you need,
'Cos I'll just stay high naturally,
Just more false starts, it tears apart,
Your heart, hour head, your soul, your brain
It helps the feeling, eases the pain.

Now we're broken on the floor
She just wants me to share her
It hasn't been this way before
She just wants me to dare her
The phone rings
And she screams
Stab my back
It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do
I can't get past her
Falling faster
True.
It hasn't done a lot for you
And every time he held you close
Yeah, were you thinking of me
When I needed you the most
Well I hope that you're happy
The phone rings
And she screams
Stab my back
It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do
I can't get past her
Falling faster
True
It's better when I bleed for you
I hope that love he gave you
Was just enough to save you
You nearly broke my heart
Just look at what you're tearing apart
Stab my back
It's better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do
I can't get past her
Falling faster
True
It hasn't done a lot for you
It's better when I bleed for you
It never was enough to do
It hasn't done a lot for

One boy, one girl, two hearts, their world
Time goes by, secrets rise
One more, sad song, tears shed, she's gone
She'd take it back, if she only could
All the perfect words they seem so wrong,
She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see,
The door is closed and you wish you could be
Alone with you, alone with me
What can I do, I can not breath
My heart is torn, for all to see
Alone with you, alone with me.
Best friend, worst thing, she's been, cheating
Friend deceives, she leaves
Last date. she cries, whispers, goodbye
She walks once more, out that door
Please stay, don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
Stay, don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
What can I do?
Alone with you, alone with me, what can I do
I can not see, alone with, alone with

Here's a story that must be told
It's kinda' new, not very old
About a female martian with a wild grin
Big orange eyes and green skin
Blue was her hair
She came from way up there
She wore silver underwear
Almost naked but she didn't care
Why oh, why did she come from
Planet V?
I don't know woh who who
[Chorus]
Martian girl from Planet V
Will you marry me?
Wo wo wo wo wo
She came from outer space
She came to see
If earth was good
Wo wo wo wo
In the supermarket she got distracted
In the meat department
Wo wo wo wo wo
She's looking at me
She's looking hungry
Think she's gonna eat me!
Wo wo wo wo wo
She's not a bird
She's not a plane
She's got green blood
Pumping through her veins.
Saw a light in the sky
And then I found her
Now I'm having my own close encounter
She smiled at me as she fixed her hair
And then she kissed me
Right then and there
I started bleeding,
That's the weirdest part
''cause this alien's teeth were razor sharp!
[Chorus]
Woah, Oh Baby,
What a wacky alien she was
I'll tell you why, It's just because
She had an appetite that couldn't be beat
She came from space to eat people meat
I guess I didn't taste good anyway
''cause when she kissed me,
she flew away!
[Chorus]

Sometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep,
I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep,
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of,
My cup runneth over with love . . .
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see,
I study the small things, you do constantly,
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of,
My cup runneth over with love . . .
In only a moment, we both will be old,
We won`t even notice the world turning cold.
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above,
My cup runneth over with love . . .
With love . . .

If you had a dollar
And I had a dime
I wonder, could I borrow yours
As easy as you could mine?
Because when you need my love
And I give time after time
And turn around to find me no returns,
Then my friend, you've used my dimes
If there's water in the pitcher,
And we both need a drink
To stay alive, my darlin',
I'd need less water than you think
My love, my love, these things, I swear, I say are true
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you
Oh, yeah
Listen to this
Some people want,
But they don't wanna give
They can do all of the wrong in the world
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of loving me
Starting today,
Tomorrow, and forevermore
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me
Then, baby, just don't darken my front door

If You've ever had
A broken Heart
You promise yourself
To never let it happen again
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to dream about it
But it finds it's way back into your head
The "I love you"'s
The "I need you"'s
They're only words that people say
They're just words
When they're hand in hand
With the games that people play
If I never see the top of a mountain
If I never set foot in the sea
I promise you I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will follow
You've changed the way that I need to think
I promise you I'll you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me
Take a look at me
I let you have my heart
I swore I'd never let it happen again
I'm not mad about it
I'm kinda glad about it
Cause I know on you girl
I can depend
The "I love you"'s
The "I need you"'s
They're only words that people say
They're just words
When they're hand in hand
With the games that people play
(But) If I never see the top of a mountain
If I never set foot in the sea
I promise you I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will follow
You've changed the way that I need to think
I promise you I'll you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me
I believe
Yes, I believe
I believe in love again
And I swear
I'll always be there
Isn't this the way that it should be?
If I never see the top of a mountain
If I never set foot in the sea
I promise you I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will follow
You've changed the way that I need to think
I promise you I'll you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me

I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord
Singing
Yes, Lord, Yes Lord
Yes, Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord
Yes, Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord
Yes, Yes Lord Amen
I'm trading my wealth
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down
To the Joy of the Lord.

Amen

Standing in the line we're aberrations
Defects in a defect's mirror
And we've been here all the time
real fixations
Hidden deep in the furor-
What we do is secret-secret!
We're influential guys for the D.C.C.
We can lie so perfect
And we've got a party line
to every call
It's a very short circuit-
What we do is secret-secret!
Licensed to drill with the torch
in our lives,
Walking on shallow water
Progressed to the
point of no distinction
Dementia of a higher order
What we do is secret-secret!

Some fellas only think of themselves
Themselves and no one else
Don't care if it's good for you
And fall asleep before you're finished too
Let me be your Tarzan
Swingin' from a tree
Triple w dot superhero dot me
I will show you things
You've never seen
All about you
What you want to do
Everything you like
Pullin' on your hair
Keep it right there
All night, all night
Can't go too long
Put it down strong
'Til your work is done
Somebody said
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
I'll do whatever you want me to
For as long as you want me to
Whatever's clever, baby
I'm prepared
I got a camera
Can we take it there?
I can be a Tarzan
Swingin' from a tree
Triple w dot superhero dot me
I will show you things
You've never seen
All about you
What you want to do
Everything you like
Pullin' on your hair
Keep it right there
All night, all night
Can't go too long
Put it down strong
'Til your work is done
Somebody said
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
Don't stop
Get it, get it
I'm just playin'
Unless you're with it
In '95 I told you 'bout the floor
(When we go down on the floor)
The ratio is one to floor
I don't see nothin' wrong
This could go on & on
It's a privilege
To have you here
With me
All about you
What you want to do
Everything you like
Pullin' on your hair
Keep it right there
All night, all night
Can't go too long
Put it down strong
'Til your work is done
Somebody said
Relax don't do it
When you want to come

I feel like I haven't trust in what has changed has been enough
I couldn't grasp what wasn't there
Until I fell through tongues sweet grab
These fragile eggs will likely crack
Unless we pick another trap
I have myself I've straightened my back
Advance forward I won't look back
I broke this bubble that bought my sense
This machine rebuilt again
What other city can be a test
Do I really think I'm at my best
These fragile eggs will likely crack
Unless we pick another trap
I have myself I've straightened my back
Advance forward I won't look back
I've completely life goes on
I have been up until the sun
Cut through that small place at my back
I will prevail I don't need that

Some people wait for a life time
Waiting for dreams to come true
But sometimes all our dreams just dont happen
And that makes you feel like
Like nothing can work out right for you
But then again, I got you in my life
Im good with that coz nothing can come between us
At least I got one thing right
And thats a fact coz there aint no there to see
It reminded me of something to hold on to
While I dont need something coz I got you
Thats how we get right
Chorus
All you need is one good thing that makes you happy
One good thing that lifts your heart
One good thing that makes the difference
Thats more than enough if it makes you happy
Sometimes you get just what you wish for
Whatever you want, whatever you say
But somehow you still feel like something's missing
Lord knows I looked everywhere else
Now I look inside myself
Repeat Chorus

It starts in your head
And moves to your hands
Your body starts shakin'
Cuz you're in demand
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neuro-sutra can can...
You're lashed 'twixt the stars
With your ice and motor cars:
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neuro-sutra can can
Oh yea! Yea! Pull out the zen
I've got a Buddhist principle in my hand
Your life seems wasted your bodies laced in
Don't stop now you've got to trace it...
You put your hands together
Writhe in the shackle
You twist your body round
Till it starts to crackle:
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neuro-sutra can can...
Right here right now shake it in and out some
Lights on off now make it spin and fight now

Girl, take this heart of mine
Take it and do what'cha wanna do
Huh, you know you made my life a mess
But I must confess
I can't stop, can't stop loving you
'Cause you know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I'm so helpless, ain't nothin' I can do, yeah
'Cause you know my weakness is you
I built a wall around my heart
When you left me for that other man
Aww, but brick by brick, girl, you tore it down
And I find myself loving you again
Somehow you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I'm so helpless, ain't nothin' I can do, yeah
Cause you know my weakness is you
And I'm just your fool
Yes, I am
Huh
One more thing I have
I said the next time you knocked on my door
I rehearsed and planned to send you away
Baby, but the words I rehearsed came out in reverse
Instead of sending you away I begged you to stay
You know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do
Just like a child, I'm so helpless, ain't nothin' I can do, yeah
Cause you know my weakness is
You know, you know
You know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
My hands are tied, I'm so helpless, ain't nothin' I can do, yeah
'Cause you know my weakness is
I'll be doggone
You know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
My hands are tied, I'm so helpless, ain't nothin' I can do, girl
Cause you know my weakness is
One more time, now
You know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do

Like kings and queens we dance!
To keep this night alive.
Honestly we're just too honest.
Full blooded friends, don't break their promise.
You don't Have to be blood to be family.
Wake up to all the town.
Its way to late but were still down.
Its way to late but were still down.
Dance with me.
This should be the soundtrack to the show,
Look out! We're always asking for.
We play for keeps in this game of loss.
We love to laugh and laugh and love.
We dance to show them what kings and queens are made of.
Singing a life with no regrets,
There's no time and I feel better spent...
With my best friends.
Honestly we're just too honest
Full blooded friends, don't break their promise.
You don't have to be blood to be family.
Wake up to all the town.
It's way to late but were still down.
It's way to late but were still down.
Why can't we all just sing along?
Why can't we all just sing along?
Why can't we all just sing along?
Why can't we?
Why can't we?

Here I sit in a low lit room
I think I'd like you right on top
All I have is a mind that needs to sink
You're always right on top
Guess if you were around tonight I'd know
I'd ask the questions if you still got it
You still got it?
Hey
Here I sit in a place we used to lay
And I'd love you right on top
Now I know like a taste that melts away
One day you'll stop
If you say
"I'm scared"
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right?
It's too bad you're lonely
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you (as long as I'm with you)
Guess your name on a wall I see
Your face too and I just can't stop
Because I know your body your press your taste you waste
When you're not right on top
Guess if you were around tonight I'd think
I'd ask the questions if you still got it?
Do you still got it?
I'll ask the questions again
Do you still got it?
'Cause I got it
If you say
"I'm scared"
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right?
It's too bad you're lonely
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
You say
"It's just goodnight"
It's no way
But I can't deny
This once and only
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
I think that you know
I don't want to want you
All that I need is a better day
I want you to know too, you can leave me dry
Can't you leave me tonight?
If you say
"I'm scared"
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right?
It's too bad you're lonely
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm
If you say
"I'm scared"
It's never right
It's unfair
Was it ever right?
It's too bad you're lonely (lonely)
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
You say
"It's just goodnight"
It's no way
But I can't deny
This once and only (and only)
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
(I don't want to want you) As long as I'm with you
(I don't want to need you) As long as I'm with
(I don't want to want you) It's too bad you're lonely (lonely)
'Cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you
('cause I'm alright as long as I'm with you)

Billy Druids face is marble
He keeps veery thought in its place
He lets the days turn tomorrow
Someone's always walking
on his grave
He wears the lines just like Garbo
And talks at a saturmine pace
Listening to the strange notes marvel
Only giving what it takes
It's a sad man's world
And for Billy it's sure to crown
Dragging beauty into darkness
Inflciting a pale white frown
And the matter the runs
Through Billy's head
Is too concerned to fall

What good is a kiss
Especially if it's not
With the one you truly love
Baby, don't kiss your life away
What good is a house if it's not a home
We don't wanna spend our lives alone
Baby, there's nothing that will stay
Don't leave me now
Some people search but they search too far
When love is so close to their hearts
I won't be searching 'cause love was right here
And it's clear it's right in your arms, baby
Don't you go breaking my heart
Don't run away from these arms
There's something I need you to know
Love will be waiting at home
Don't you go breaking my heart
Don't be afraid of these arms
There's something I need you to know
That love will be waiting at home
What good is a heart
If it's heart alone without
Someone special there to hold
The heart was not meant to waste away
What good is a love if it's not sincere
You need someone special who's always there
Not someone who'll just drift away
Some people search through their whole life long
Trying to find someone true
Well don't you go searching cause love is right here
Don't you fear it's waiting for you
Don't you go breaking my heart
Don't run away from these arms
There's something I need you to know
Love will be waiting at home
Don't you go breaking my heart
Don't be afraid of these arms
There's something I need you to know
That love will be waiting at home
I will be there waiting for you
You need only call I'm there for you
I'll give you my heart and I'll be true
I'll be there for you and only for you
Don't you go breaking my heart
Don't run away from these arms
There's something I need you to know
Love will be waiting at home
Don't you go breaking my heart
Don't be afraid of these arms
There's something I need you to know
That love will be waiting at home
I will be there be waiting for you
You need only call I'm there for you
I'll give you my heart and I'll be true
Love will be waiting for you

Too much is never enough. Super-size, my eyes like satellites. The say live faster. The say die harder. I've got my TV on channel zero all night long. My volume knob's turned up to eleven... 4, 5, 6... 24/7. Everybody wants a redder red, blacker blues, and deader deads. Everybody wants a broken heart yeah, yeah. Fill me to the top and baby don't stop. I want sixty jolts per minute. More volts, gimme lightning bolts. I want my radio to blast that static all night long. My volume knob's turned up to eleven... 4, 5, 6... 24/7. Excess, access always on. Excess, access all night long.

The memo says
We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using the people's voice
"We don't want to talk about it"
The press scribble, scribble every half-truth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April fools joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care
They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue
(Red white and blue)
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still a-skew
They don't want to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
(Wo, wo)
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute, oh
And on the TV screen diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
Was it WMDs or Democracy? Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say
We don't want to talk about it
The White House boils over, "Al Jazeera got it wrong"
The Press Corpse jumps on board singing the White House song
While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
The spineless war drumming, press corpse have taken lives
They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue
(Red white and blue)
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still a-skew
They don't want to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
(Wo, wo)
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute, oh
Fires fueled on endless lies
Black shrouds coat desert skies
A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
As embeds report what they're fed
We don't want to talk about it
We don't want to talk about it
We don't want to talk about it
We don't want to talk about it
(We don't want to talk about it)
We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk about it
(We don't want to)
We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk
They don't want to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
(Wo, wo)
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute, oh, oh

You can't change it
Can't re-arrange it
If time is all that we got
Then baby let's take it
Lovin' is a lovin'
The moment is a-right
It's worth all the years in the past
Let's go one more night
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more
Goodnight my darlin'
Another day has passed
Forget all those painful memories
Our love's gonna last
Come to me baby
Come to me one more time
It's time we got movin'
Time to move on
Let's slide out the door
Let's slide out the door
Ride our way home
Let's glide our way home
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
I've come back for more

Take your pick and make a stand,
With no regrets or change of plan,
Keep your head, don't be afraid,
Be proud of the choice you've made.
Support your scene, you must believe,
Never stop just move ahead
(Chorus)
Oh Oh Oh! Definite Choice!
Be positive, no ignorance,
To mindlessness, we must protest.
'Cause we're for real, we're gonna prove
That our movement's on the move,
Fuck big business, church and war,
That's not what we're fighting for
(Repeat Chorus)

That day, oh, yeah
When you walked away
I wanted to call you back
But I didn't know what to say
But when you said you had to part
Something hit, hit me all at once
Love walked right in
And caught me by suprise
Cause you
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Ooh, girl
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
That's right
You threw a lucky punch
Baby, baby
When I saw you, huh, uh huh
For the very first time
I wanted, wanted to love you
And leave you behind
Until you put me down
I had won every round
But something hit
Hit me all at once
Girl, I never thought you
Log on to kill this message.
Would open my nose
But you
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Ooh, girl
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You threw a lucky punch
Since I loved you
Let me prove my love is true
And love you tender
Oh, please, baby, surrender
I've been a playboy, it's true
But I'm hanging up my heart for you
So I guess I'll wait around
Tears falling down
Hoping you'd change your heart
And realize I need you by my side
Cause you
You threw a lucky punch
(You threw a lucky punch)
Ooh, girl
You hit me in my heart
(You threw a lucky punch)
That's right
Come on, it was a TKO
You made me love you so
You hit me left, right, left
Knocked me down...

There is something baby about you
That's really attracting me yeah
And your sweet love darling
Really got a hold on me
I've got a little taste of your love
And now I'm hooked on you yeah
And I keep falling
Falling but what can I do
I'm too weak to fight
Listen to me baby
Too weak to fight, yeah
You're breaking down my health girl
Can't eat, I can't sleep
I've tried to turn you loose
But your hook is in too deep oh yeah
My resistance is getting a little low
And I've got to find a cure
Cause I keep falling, falling
Falling for you yeah
I'm too weak to fight
Listen to me baby
Too weak to fight, yeah
I'm too weak to fight
You're messin' with my head
You got me too weak to fight
Too weak to fight now baby
Calling wrong numbers
Too weak to fight now baby
You got my head going round and round
Too weak to fight now baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Too weak to fight

Every time my baby and I have a quarrel
I swear I won't give in
Then my baby starts to smile at me
And I know, I know I just can't win
When my little girl is smiling
There's nothing more I can say, whoa
I see those big bright eyes and then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way
Oh, let me tell you now, when my little girl is smiling (when my little girl is smiling)
I can't stay mad at her for long (when my little girl is smiling)
Why should I want to fight when I can hold her tight?
I just don't care who's right or wrong (when my little girl is smiling)
Oh, let me tell you now, when my little girl is smiling (when my little girl is smiling)
It's the greatest thrill there can be (when my little girl is smiling)
She gets her way it's true, but I know I won't be blue
As long as she just smiles for me (when my little girl is smiling)

I'm the son of a [?]
Son of Shaft
(Don't forget my daddy)
Son of Shaft
Son of Shaft
I was born and raised
And thrown in the street
Had the problems of a man
At the age of three
My daddy was bad
I've been told
So my family name
I must serve on
I love by the clock
And live by the gun
If you ever met the father
Assume you met the son, yeah
Check now
I'm the son of Shaft
(Now you can believe that)
Have trust on me

Come on
Come along
Come on and get up, get down
[Chorus]
(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet
(Come on and) rise, rise, rise
Shake your hips
(Get up) let me see you
(I wanna see you)
Let me see your tight wire come alive
(Get up) you ain't too old
(You ain't too hip) (get up)
I ain't asking for a cartwheel
(A somersault) or no flip
I just want you to
[Chorus]
(Get up) now look at mama
(Look at mama)
She'll tear you up (get up)
To make sure you feel the cool
I get to turn the music up
(Get up) clap your hands
Stomp your feet (get up)
Keep in time with the music
Get on down with the beat
I just want you to
[Chorus]
Come on
[Chorus]
Come on and get down
Get up and get down
Come on, girl, oh, ooh
[Chorus x2]

Their 2 + 2 does not equal 4
Their 2 + 2 equals whatever, they want us to die for
About face, snap to attention
Form your own conclusions to the things you see
About face, sometimes the explanations
Don't add up to the facts
Time and again they manufacture a cause
And rally the public around it, check out the movie, "Wag The Dog"
Killing to further the interest of private corporations
Killing to control global economic situations
Killing for personal gain, i.e. Bush in Panama
Learn the fuckin' truth, you won't be so quick to sign on
About face, snap to attention
Form your own conclusions to the things you see
About face, sometimes the explanations
Don't add up to the facts
Our lives reflect TV sitcoms and tragedies
Like a bad joke, I ask, "How many of you don't see and just how many?
How many of you swallow the lies?
How many of you do not realize?"
Gung ho and true to the Stars and Stripes
They fuckin' brainwashed you to do their bidding
And like a flock of sheep with wool over your eyes
You never stop to question, you just fall into line
The media's a business that provides entertainment
Their bottom line, money, and stories that will make it
So they run with stories that promotes the lies
To keep the ratings coming, wealth from promoting world strife
Life must be so easy when you don't have to think
Black and whit, like printing from the newspaper's ink
I wish I had the chance to reveal all the lies
But you're so fucking brainwashed, would it even help to try
To get through to you
To get through, through, through, through, through, through
To get through to you

I heard from your mom that you cried out last night
For a certain someone to turn on the lights
You found that someone was not by your side
And Mom had to wipe away your tears
You asked her, "Why Dad isn't here?"
She starts to tell you that Dads working late
You say, What come every day of the week?
But she answers you with, "Why? Go back to sleep"
Your heart tells you something has changed
Why they've been acting so strange
Well, I'm here to tell you, you don't have to fear
Cause your daddy loves you, I'm not going nowhere
And I won't give you up, not gon walk away
When it comes to you and I nothing's gonna change
I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be scared
I'm not going no, I'm not going nowhere
Its true that I live in a whole different house
But that doesn't mean that I won't come around
I'm still best of friends with your mom, have no doubt
We'll still make time to hang out
I promise I won't let you down
Well, I've got a room with your name on the door
Your favorite things you could ever ask for
Then best of all if you cry out at night
I'll be the one by your side
Someone to help dry your eyes
Well, I'm here to tell you, you don't have to fear
Cause your daddy loves you, I'm not going nowhere
And I won't give you up, not gon walk away
When it comes to you and I nothing's gonna change
I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be scared
Cause I'm not going no, I'm not going nowhere
I know you feel a little scared, I know you think its not fair
You think its all your fault but its not, I swear
If it wasnt for you things could never be so cool
So I thank you for being the one in my life
That showed both of us that we did something right
Well, I'm here to tell you, you don't have to fear
Cause your daddy loves you, I'm not going nowhere
And I won't give you up, Im not gon walk away
When it comes to you and I nothing's gonna change
I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be scared
Well, I'm here to tell you, you don't have to fear
Cause your daddy loves you, I'm not going nowhere
And I won't give you up, not gon walk away
When it comes to you and I nothing's gonna change
I'm here to tell you, you don't have to be scared
Cause I'm not going, no I'm not going nowhere

Seeking, hoping, trying to be who you want
Fearful, thankful, able to see a difference, oh, oh
Change my name
Change my name
I left myself and you remain
Change my name
Come and take away my breath
Break it, burn it, I know that you've always hated it
It's hard to say it, but I love you more than all of this
I love you more than this
Change my name
Change my name
I left myself and you remain
Change my name
I change my name
When it's all lost, I find a freedom
When it's all gone, I find a light
So give me a name and I'm yours forever
Oh, give me a name and I'm yours
I'm yours
Change my name
Change my name
I left myself, I'm not the same
I left myself in yesterday
I left myself and you remain
Change my name
Change my name

Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday I saw your smiling face
Love walked through my door
One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything alright
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever
Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
Felt the sun shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through a storm, through the darkest night
I found my brightest star
One magic moment made one magic night
I fell in love with one look in your eyes
I never knew I could feel so alive
Darling, in your arms I could feel forever
Hook
Do you get lonely (ooh I get lonely)
Thinking about you me (thinking about you)
Am I the only (girl I dream of or think of at all)
Are you into me
Outta your mind for me
Say you can't go a day without me
Hook 2 times

Every morning when I rise
I can just see heaven in your eyes
It makes me know
This is not an every day love
We've got something I'm sure we can be proud of
We've got so much love
We've got so much trust
I can see a halo hanging over us
Your love is heavenly design
I like kissing you
Holding you
Wanting you
Squeezing you

Well I remember my first day of public school
I was very scared of getting pummeled
And sure enough i did at first recess
I got pegged in the head by a big red ball
And stumbled, my head hung
Back to class with a bloody nose
and soon it was lunch time
Mom said I should ask about how poor kids there get fed
So i got a book of tickets and a scedule and it read
(chorus)
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
All the kids would line up super early just to eat
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of pork and beans
Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day
The best day of the week
Well i remember my first day of Jr. High
I had hairspray in my hair and my pants were way too tight
And all the breakers and new-wavers and the rockers and the preps
Would all be in their places on the front lawn or the steps
I hung out with some punker kids who used to make me laugh
Got thrown in the dumpster by some rich kids near the caff
As time went on we figured out it was totally uncool
To eat the welfare lunch
Provided by the school
So in poser punker fashion we just mooched off all the kids
And lived off eating candy bars and bags of nacho chips
(chorus)
Well now I'm out of school and i don't have a job (you're a slob)
I just sit around all sweaty and lethargic
And i'm just thinkin' 'bout where it all went wrong
Why I can't concentrate on anything but reruns
I wish i had some more stability and I
I wish I had somebody makin' lunch for me
I guess I miss the simple things in life
The thought of pizza day
I thought it stupid then but I wish I had it now
I just want
(chorus)
Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day...
Best day of the week
Says Michael Jackson of Ensino California.
When he's not in his little theme parks,
He's eating pizza with the kids.
Whoa, moonwalker's back.
Hey, grab a slice buddy!!
Take your glove off first,
You'llenjoy it more.

With Sugar Pie DeSanto
I don't wanna believe
The bad things about you
Oh, no, now
Cause if they're true
I'll have to get along without you
Oh, ooh, now
I said the word, the sound
The song about the things you do
Moving and a grooving
Using and a fooling
Chasing around every skirt in town
If it's true, you'll be on your way
Do I make myself clear
Do I make myself clear
I said you're gonna have to
Stop and check yourself
Oh, yeah, now
I'm not gonna have a man
That's got somebody else, oh, no
Oh, you tell him now, girl, now, now
So if you're running around, baby
Thinking of putting me down
You're wrong
Taking away what belongs to me
Giving to her when I'm in need
If it's true, you'll be on your way
Do I make myself clear
Do I make myself clear
I said, do, do I
Do I make myself clear
Do you understand me
Do, do I, do I make myself clear
Oh, you better listen to her now
Oh, yeah, ohh, yeah, now
Oh, oh, oh...
So why won't you try to do
Something to change it
Yeah, yeah
And make me know it's not
The way they claim it, oh, yeah
Now let me tell you something
All I wanted you to be true, honey
Love me like you say you do, oh, yeah
And I won't care for what they say
Instead, I'll turn my head and walk away
But if it's true, you know what to do
Do I make myself clear
Do I make myself clear
I said, do, do I
Do I make myself clear
And oh, oh, oh, yeah, now
Oh, oh...
I said do, do, do, do
Do I make myself clear

Sorrow
Is the street that I'm living on
Across pain avenue
In a town call moan
The people I see are sadder than me
A river of tears
Don't you know it flows by my door
And I'm living
(next door to the blues)
Yes I'm living
(next door to the blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move
Oh lord
Next door to the blues
Memory
You can tell it in my talk
My heart hurts
Even when I walk
I cry on
A pillar made of stone
Pity is my name
And that thing called love is to blame
And I'm living
(next door to the blues)
Yes I'm living
(next door to the blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, oh lord
Next door to the blues
Bittersweet
Is the food that I cook
My only joy is in a storybook
The talk I give
Every word brings a tear
Every hello
Just ends with a sad goodbye
And I'm living
(next door to the blues)
Yes I'm living
(next door to the blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, oh lord
Next door to the blues

You'll get yours when you're good and ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes
You can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
The sign said: "detour"
So I did
And I found myself in a wonderful place
Fields of green
When the wind blows cold
The kind of place one could grow old
Sky opened up (yeah!)
Sun showered down (aww!)
Onto a row of wooden pikes
What an awe inspiring sight
Birds shy on top of them
Puts your head in a beautiful state
You'll get yours when you're good and ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes
You can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
Life is a horror show
And baby it will never stop
They tell me to watch my step
I answer back: "You watch your mouth!"
So many stories you have told
You and stories have grown old
SOS who will save our ship?
SOS who gives a shit?
Sinking like a rock with a heart of coal
Sinking like a rock without a soul
Please note, don't underestimate
Cause I'm a cruel motherfucker!
You'll get yours when you're good and ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes
You can be good and sure
The day belongs to us
The new dawn starts this day
As strange and savage poetry make up your eulogy
Tables turned around and turned on you
No one sheds a tear
No one loses sleep
You disappear
We fall asleep
You disappear

Blank face, little girl
Your color's running down
Its the one you love
Cry out my world
This copulated kiss
Its the last that you deserve
Ive done wrong
Ive been gone
Its the one you love
Drink down and your candles burn
Away, away
Dreaming you, is so easy, yeah
If it was up to me
Then you would cry tonight
If it was up to you
Take you, take me
I cant go with you now

So kiss yourself goodbye
Ive done wrong

One drink and your candles burn
Away, away
Dreaming you, is so easy, yeah
If it was up to me
Then you would cry tonight
When it's up to you
You kiss yourself goodbye
Let go, push your daisies
A thousand maybes
A thousand left I'm done
A white glow, just for tasting
A life for wasting
(Its the one you love)
And I look into your eyes
It's the one you love
Last one then I fill you up today, today
How can you sleep?
When dreaming you, is so easy, yeah
If it was up to me
Then you would cry tonight
When it's up to you
You kiss yourself goodbye
You would cry tonight
(Yeah)
So kiss yourself goodbye
(Yeah)
You would cry tonight
(Yeah)

Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do between us
That managed to tear us apart
But oh I believe if we work real hard
We can get through, through it this time
Girl just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing that we can't get through
[Chorus:]
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you, babe
To stay with me
Trust never came between us
And that's just the way that we are
It's the crazy things we do between us
That managed to break both our hearts
But oh I believe that we can survive
Through anything if we'd only try
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Go
No one flag flies over the multi-national company
No allegiance to the board's homeland
Fellow citizens, the flag, born of their country
As the brainwashed nationalists move
To shed their blood on battlefields
War profiteering rich, watch their stock reap high yields
We're tearing down the borders
We're fighting for the rights of freedom
Woah, woah woah
We're tearing down the borders
We're fighting for the rights of freedom
Woah, woah woah
Go
No patriotic pledge from multinational companies
Only a commitment to lock away
Equality and steal away all freedom from the
Poorest of the poor so that the board room can insure
Their stockholders profits are higher in return
We're tearing down the borders
We're fighting for the rights of freedom
Woah, woah woah
We're tearing down the borders
We're fighting for the rights of freedom
Woah, woah
It's our world, let's take it back
(Let's set ourselves free, woah)
It's our world, let's take it back
(Let's set ourselves free, woah)
It's our world, we want it back
(Let's set ourselves free, woah)
It's your world, take your world back
Take it fucking back
There's a call, a ringing sound
Around the globe, it's gaining ground
We're tearing down the boarders, woah
There's a voice in your heart
It beckons you to do your part
We're tearing down the boarders, woah
Your line is drawn in the sand
On one side, you're a slave, the other, a free man
We're tearing down the boarders, woah
There's a call, freedom's sound
Around the globe, it's gaining ground
We're tearing down the boarder
We're tearing down the boarder
We're tearing down the boarder

I run after you
Like a fool would do
But mama didn't raise no fool
And I should know
That baby you got it
That's all I can say to you
[Chorus]
You got soul, too much soul
Foxy clothes, the cutest nose
The greatest shape
There's nothing fake about you
Baby you got it
People can be cruel
They say I lost my cool
But it's very hard to keep my cool
When I'm around you
'Cause baby you got it
That's all I can say to you
[Chorus]
Now that I found you
Gonna cling to you
I'll give you lovin', money
Everything to you
No matter what they say
Doesn't matter what I do
I'm never gonna love another girl but you
'Cause baby you got it
That's all I can say to you
[Chorus]
My friends say no can be
You're not the girl for me
But I see a lot of things
In you that they can't see
Oh baby you got it
That's all I can say to you
(Repeat Chorus)
You got soul, too much soul,
Baby you got it
Foxy clothes, cutest nose,
Baby you got it
Greatest shape, nothin' fake
Baby you got it
Groovy lips, make me flip,
Baby you got it
Pretty eyes, hypnotize
Baby you got it

I want to spend the night
With you
Forever
Every time we wind up spending the night
Together
Do you ever feel it?
I want to share my life
With you
Forever
Ever time we wind sharing a night
Together
Do you ever feel it?
And when I stay away from you
I never get to sleep
I try to hug my pillow
And pretend that you're with me
But I can't feel it
Then when we are together
It's right there for me to see
I can't keep looking at loneliness
And trying to call it freedom
Do you ever feel it?
I want to spend the night
With you
Forever
Every time we wind up spending the night
Together
Do you ever feel it?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?
Do you ever want to spend the night?

Put your arms around me, honey,
And hold me tight,
Huddle up and cuddle up
With all your might,
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me,
My heart begins to float,
Then it starts a rockin'
Like a motor boat,
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you.
Hold me tight
All your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
Begins to float
Motor boat

Any girl like you.
So put your arms around me, honey,
And hold me tight,
Huddle up and cuddle up
With all your might,
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you
Any girl like you [Repeat to Fade]

Boyfriend I'm true to you, don't make me blue
I thought we had together and that everythin' was going okay
But than you started showin' me another side of you
I've never seen before
Nothin' that I would do was ever enough for you boy, ooh baby
And that you're drivin' our Mercedes Benz
Loaned you a little cash to spend
But still that just wasn't enough, oh no
'Cause what you see always seems to be what you sweat
Ooh, you're never satisfied, you're always wantin' somethin' better, yeah
That's the way you are, wantin' more and more and more
My friends all think I'm crazy after everythin' that I know about you
I'm still havin' mixed emotions boy, they just don't wanna fade away
Nothin' that I would do was ever enough for you boy, ooh baby
I let you cruise in my Mercedes Benz
Loaned you a little cash to spend
Still that just wasn't enough, oh
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
Ooh, you're never satisfied, you're always wantin' somethin' better, yeah
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
You're never satisfied, always wantin' somethin' better, yeah
He's sweatin', he's got to conquer, he's sweatin' by the hour
He's sweatin', he's got the taste, still sweatin' on the flower
He's sweatin', he can't stand it
He's makin' moves that's how he planned it
He's not satisfied with the best, he' got to check out all the rest
Nothin' that I would do would ever enough for you boy
You wanna have my Mercedes Benz
Gave you a little cash to spend
Still that just wasn't enough, oh no
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
You're never satisfied, you're always wantin' somethin' better
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
You're never satisfied, always wantin' somethin' better
What you see, you're never satisfied
Always wantin' somethin' better
What you see always seems to be what you sweat
Always wantin' somethin' better

The future's not promised, the past unknown
I'm only working with flesh and bone
One thing's for certain is that I need you now
And all of the time
But I don't know how 'cause
I'm going crazy, going out of my mind
Cause you've got me thinking about you
At the most inappropriate times
I don't want a cure for this
If I exist, it's only to serve you
For all you are to me, baby
Life is being with you
And everything else is just waiting
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Life is making love to you
And everything else is just waiting
So hold on, baby

It's hard to stay focused in times like this
What on me's broken only you can fix
Cause I'm feeling you so strong
Baby, you're my favorite song
And I'm gonna play you all night long
But I don't know how 'cause
I'm going crazy, going out of my mind
Cause you've got me thinking about you
At the most inappropriate times
I don't want a cure for this
If I exist, it's only to serve you
For all you are to me
Life is being with you
And everything else is just waiting
Hold on, baby

I was born in a crossfire hurricane, well
And I howled at my ma, at the driving rain, ooh yeah
But it's alright, oh, that is a gas
I said, it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas, oh yeah
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag, yeah
I was schooled with a strap right across my back, oh, yes, I was
But it's alright, and that is a gas
I said, it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas
I was drowned, washed up and left for dead, yes, sure was
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, ooh
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yes, I did
I was crowned with a spike right in through my head, oh yeah
But it's all, it's alright, oh, and that is a gas
I said, it's all, alright
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas, yes, it is
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, will you jump?)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

You could be the one
Did you say you had to leave
Can you stay the night with me
Is that the way it has to be
How I hate to see you go
But it's ok
Because I know
You could be the one
I waited for
You could be the one
That opens up the door
You could be the one
I run to
You could
Be the one
You could be the one
To share my nights
You could be the one
That brightens up my life
You could be the one
I run to
You could be the one
Every night I wish upon a star
Only wanna be with you
I just wanna be where u are
My body's callin' out your name
Girl tell me that you feel the same
You could be the one
I waited for
You could be the one
That opens up the door
You could be the one
I run to
You could
Be the one
I waited like forever
Thought I'd find you never
I just might be done
Think I've found the one

I can feel you flowing through me
Holy Spirit come and fill me up
Come and fill me up
Love and mercy fill my senses
I am thirsty for your presence Lord
Come and fill me up
Lord let your mercy wash away
All of my sin
Fill me completely with your love
Once again
I need you
I want you
I love your presence
I need you
I want you
I love your presence

I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings
About being fair
Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shines
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town
It's hard to do right
In this filthy night
Just plain simple comfort
Is completely out of sight
My little sister, she hungry
For bread to eat
My brother's hand me down shoes
Are now showing his feet
Ghetto blues showed on the news
All is aware, but
What the hell do they care
You across the track
Completely relaxed
You take a warning fact
Don't you never come back
I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings
About being fair
Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shines
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town
Oh baby, it's hard to do right, you know
On the other side of town
Depression really got a hold on me
On the other side of town

Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in
Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I must've had too much weekend
Call my job, have someone operate my machine
Call my job, have someone operate my machine
You look so good to me this morning, I must've had too much weekend
Hang the hat off the hook, lock the door too, spend my time, making love to you
Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
I must've had too much weekend

Girl, it's been a long, long time comin' yes it has
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait yeah
Yeah
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up it's gates for me and you yeah
And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you, yeah
And you've got me too (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause

That someone like you loves me too yeah
Hooh yeah
Hoo huh I think that you're truly somethin', yes you are hoo
And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true yeah
With you baby, it never rains and it's no wonder

It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you
And every time I close my eyes

And you've got me too (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause

7 Seconds
The Crew
This Is The Angry (Part 1)
Tired of hearing us moan and complain,
Just 'cos you don't feel it
Doesn't mean there's no pain,
Brought up then let down and run through the course,
Able to fuck us and feel no remorse
(Chorus)
This is a cry for the ones who can't fight,
We're just the bad seeds who didn't turn out right,
We'll get a chance and we'll break down the door,
This is the angry, the young and the poor
Turned on your own, kicked the dirt in our face
We're stuck without money, no working, no pace,
Just think what you'd do if you were in our place,
Reality's waiting while you take up space
(Repeat Chorus)
(Break)
(Repeat Chorus)

The time has come to say goodnight.
The time has come to say goodbye to the old guard.
Goodnight.
Goodbye.
Witness the setting sun.
The tables have been turned.
We will not suffer their reprise.
A brave new voice rings out.
Intense, fearless, devout.
A listless body now revived.
Old stories fit with retreads.
Half-truths with truth left unsaid.
Each time their lips moved we heard lies.
So now it's time to say goodbye...
To the old guard, goodnight, goodbye.
To the old guard, goodnight, goodbye.
Witness the setting sun.
This century's crash and burn.
Autocracy dethroned by ire commissar doused in fire.
Make note a million times.
Their class war, deceit, lies.
Their compassion laced with despise...
All of the hatred they bred.
All the division they spread.
We always knew they lived on lies.
So now it's time to say goodbye...
Bear witness to this setting sun.
The dawning of a new age has begun.
From east to west we watch this setting sun.
The dawning of a new age has begun.
Now it's time, to say goodbye.

- And do you know what the press and everybody is gonna be asking?
- What?
- Who IS Danger Woman?!
If you've seen it once, you'll see it again
I told everyone and all of my friends
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:
(You're gonna get it!)
She's hanging off the chopper
And no one's gonna stop her
Don't try and call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground
If you could just believe what you can not see
Well that may be, she may as well be
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:
(You're gonna get it!)
She's hanging off the chopper
And nothing's gonna stop her
Don't even call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground
(I can hear her voice from miles away)
(Yo, ATL, where's she at?)
(Yo, yo, where she at, where she at, yo)
Woah, she's flying around in her head
(Danger Woman!)
Woah, Punishing what's left of the WWF
If that's what you want
That's what you get
You want Danger Woman
That's what you want
That's what you get
That's what you want,
You want Danger Woman
Well she's fighting a crime
That's all in her mind
At the Kareoke showdown
Don't try to understand her
The Phantom Highlander
The Songbird Avenger
It's Danger Woman!

(How could I say goodbye?) I was gonna say goodbye to you tonight But then you told me how much you missed me & then you took me in your arms & kissed me Oh how could I say goodbye? Oh how could I say goodbye?
You're a troubled kind of guy, that's why, that's why Tell me you can't stay for too long in one place Without a word you'll go running off to someplace Oh oh how you made me cry Oh oh how you made me cry

My man is a watch dog
My man is a watch dog, yeah
I don't want no watch dog, I want a man, uh-huh
I don't want no watch dog, I want a man right now
I don't want no man of mine
Everywhere I go, now, he's a-right behind
I don't want no watch dog, I want a man
Every time I visit my girlfriend's house
He sends his baby brother to check me out
I go outside to sweep in my front yard
He stands over me like a prison guard
I've never seen a man sneaking and a-hiding
when he should be out working and providing
He's a watch dog
Yeah, he's a watch dog

Nobody knows my trouble
Nobody seems to care
Bad luck and trouble
Follow me everywhere
Well I went to the fortune-teller
And I had my fortune told
She said "son don't worry,
Days will change when you grow old"
Well I held my head up high
And I started, started to cry
I'm not gonna worry
Days will change by and by
Well I went to the fortune-teller
And I had my fortune told
She said "son don't worry,
Days will change when you grow old"

On Saturday night, where I was born, down on the farm
Guitar plinking and we started singing 'til the break of dawn
About twelve o'clock ev'rything gets hot, up steps old Jones
We started clappin' and he started singin' a sweet little country song
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil, where've you been all day
Your momma's been lookin', hasn't stopped lookin' since you went away
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil, where did you go and stay
Your momma's been lookin', hasn't stopped lookin' since you went away

When I was a little boy back in West Virginia
We lived very close to a railroad track
And I remember I used to dream about them trains
And where they might go
And the people that worked on the trains
And the train made music, it made you feel good
I can remember sometimes
I could just stand off all by myself
And just get funky listenin' to the train
And I used to pick up a handful of gravels
And throw 'em down on the ground for ties
Yeah, and I'd make up songs, I'd sing
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
He rode across the plains
He rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
And wore bandannas made in old Japan
He was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
And a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
He used to change his name
To every place he came
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
And a railroad man
No, he was a railroad man
And a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
Used to change his name
To every place he came
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
He rode across the plains
He rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
Wore bandannas made in old Japan
And he was a railroad man
He was a railroad man
Oh, a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
Used to change his name
[Incomprehensible] to every place he came
His name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
You know, he was a good time railroad man
Good time railroad man
Oh, a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
It's alright
Say you know it's alright
If you've ever been downtown
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know, he was a good time railroad, road
Good time railroad man
Oh, a railroad man
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train
He used to change his name
To each and every place he came
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas
And Bangor when he went to Maine
He rode across the plains
He rode, he rode on a fruit freight train
The hauled bananas to Savannah
And wore bandannas made in old Japan
Oh, railroad man
Oh, railroad man
Oh, railroad man
Stepped in front of the railroad train

I'm looking through
Communist eyes
I'm seeing planes in bloodshot skies
I see the flag of a working people
Who conceal the lies in the stars
and sickle
It's a double edge
Communist eyes-c'mon inside
I can't ever find the way out
Communist eyes-lost inside
I never get a day out
I'm looking through Communist eyes
All I see is an old man's alibi
There's a world outside
but I'm unaware
I open my books but the pages stare
It's a double edge
Communist eyes-all so blind
I can't even play the game now

Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there u are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again
Hook
Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya
From that radio
It's just another lonely love song
Hook

I used to think that love was so silly
Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
And it all was for me (no not really)
But there was not a guy who was special enough
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
You bring me joy, you bring me joy, you bring me joy
I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
As if I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
I was so, so anticipating
Girl, I didn't know I had love inside of me
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
Oh girl, my, my girl
I never thought that I could love a girl the way I do
Oh boy, my my my my boy
I'm so glad that I found your love too
Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy (x2)
You bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
You bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
Keep on bringin' me
Keep on bringin' me joy
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love made me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger, danger of pain
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it, love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
I just can't explain it
My heart can't contain it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it, love saw it, love saw it, love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy

Lately I'm beginning to see signs
That you've got leaving me, on your mind
I get a cold cold feelin, when I touch you
It's hard to face, but I know the truth
[Chorus]
You see the handwriting is on the wall
I just looked up and read it all
You're getting ready to call it off
The handwriting is on the wall
The handwriting is sure on the wall
Lately when I want to make love to you
You say you're too tired or some other excuse
I might as well quit foolin' myself
There just ain't much love between us left
[Chorus]
[Chorus:Repeat x3]

I'm a gangster now look at me.
I am in the KGB.
Me and the boyz we're all so bad, so don't diss us or make us mad.
Cause we're the Kokomo Gangsta Boyz, we're tough.
We are rough and we like to cuss.
Get me by myself and I'm so weak,
But when I'm with the boyz I can't be beat.
Well, now, I'm in a gang and I'm so bad.
I got my colors they're just so rad.
I got my boyz and they got my back.
Well I'm only a freshman, but I don't care.
I'm still a man 'cause I got pubic hair.
You better watch out, cause I'm so tough.
I'm a gangster now look at me.
I am in the KGB.
Me and the boyz we're all so bad, so don't diss us or make us mad.
Cause we're the Kokomo Gangsta Boyz, we're tough.
And we are rough and we like to cuss.
Get me by myself and I'm so weak,
But when I'm with the boyz I can't be beat.
So don't look at me wrong, or get in my way,
Cause I guarantee that you will pay.
If you're messin' with me, you're messin' with the whole family.
We'll wait till after school one day
When you turn your back the other way.
We'll all jump you at once, 'cause we're so tough.
You wanna be in a gang? And you wanna be like me?
It's not hard at all, in fact it's easy.
Just follow these ten easy gangsta rules.
And you can be in our club of G-boy gangsta fools.
There's ten steps to be in a gang.
We're gonna bust a cap in your head.
If you're not in our gang, you might as well be dead.
One, get a knife or a gun. Two, get some name brand shoes.
Three, by some jnco jeans. Four, buy some more.
Five, talk like a gangsta. Six, dress like a gangsta.
Seven, listen to G-boy gangsta music. Eight, cause trouble and be full of hate.
Nine, pretend to be so tough. Ten, get a rude attitude.
And the last thing you gotta go through is let us beat the crap outta you,
Beat the tar out of you, beat you till you're black and blue.

Don't mess with my toot toot

Your ice cream man when the days are through

I want to thank you for listenin' to all of my problems
And being my shelter in and out of the storm

I can live since I found you, baby
Now I can live since I got you back, baby
I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' this man
Don't you understand what you're doin' to me, baby
We both hooked up, we played together

I want to thank for saving my life

(Rollin?)
If you utter a sound
Don't make a move
We'll kill you
Then they gathered around me
One man took my right arm
And another man took my left
When the third man grabbed the front of my coat
Then thrown in to an automobile we go
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in that 20 mile ride
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in the beautiful California moonlight
In an auto with six man and chauffeur
Yeah these Christian patriots
They put fingers in my eyes and nose
As they subjected me to torture
Yeah the torture that a good fearing man
Is capable of conceiving
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in that 20 mile ride
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in the beautiful California moonlight
You won't kiss the American flag
Well by god we'll make you
We'll ram it down your throat
Sing the Star Spangled Banner with feeling
They put their autos together
So the lamp set a sickly stage light
Fourteen defenders of this country
All commanding me to undress
They poured tar over my body and hair
In the absence of feathers they rubbed sagebrush instead
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in that 20 mile ride
Oh I wish
I could describe
The terror in the beautiful California moonlight
My suffering was terrible
But my greatest pain was over you

When could I stay away from the arousal of love
And my soul would not be inferfered by my eyes and ears easily
I adjust my gesture of my softest tenderness
My heart is so cautious I won't react hastily
Love
It's not as beautiful as anticipated
The woman in remorse
Sad love songs can be heard in every street
On this horizon is there a man suitable for me
Who can appropriately comfort my indescribable loneliness
How many years have I been drifting in the sea of love
How many times did I cry and go wild when I was young
Whenever I fall in love
There is always a force driving you involuntarily
The faces of my previous lovers are unclear
When everything is over my heart still feels the pain
Next time when I meet the right person
How can I turn back
How should I handle?
From now on
I am not eager to breakthrough from the freedom of loneliness
As long as love doesn't sneak it's way in and bother me
Beautitful lies and genuine love are only separated by a thin line
If you are not careful, everything will be mixed up and
It'll be hard to take back your hear
Love
It's not as beautiful as anticipated
The woman in remorse
Sad love songs can be heard in every street
On this horizon is there a man suitable for me
Who can appropriately comfort my indescribable loneliness
Hook
You'll only ask for one outcome when you're in love
How come whenever we meet it will turn out to be
A complex of love and hatred?
What would be considered a promise of mutual benefit
Let give and take can be clearly shown until the last moment

I fell in love with the girl in the picture
That I used to keep
Carried her 'round in the back of my pocket
She was always with me
I imagine that I was a man of importance
And she had a fancy for me
And I use to dream she would call
Crying her eyes out
She had an obsession with me
I was the love of her life
And she was all mine
The girl in the life magazine
The first time I we met in an aisle
At the market
She was staring at me
I knew even then we would share
Something special
And it was like chemistry
I fell in love from the moment I saw her
So I took her straight home with me
And that's where I'd dream
She would step right out of the picture
And spend a whole evening with me
And oh how she hated to go
Back to her picture
The girl in the life magazine
All of my friends used to laugh
Said I was certifiably mad
'til the day she came
And she blew them away
And asked me if I'd be her man
It seems that she went and fell
In love with my letters
Says she's been looking for me
So the story ends well
We end up together
The girl in the life magazine

Fue de la chica de aquella revista que me enamore
En mi bolsillo su foto escondida
Para siempre guarde
Y yo me sentia un hombre importante
Al verla mirandome a mi
En suenos a veces la vi
Obsesionada
Llamando y llorando por mi
Yo era su vida, su amor
Y ella queria
Delar la revista por mi
La vi una tarde alla en el mercado
Me miraba al pasar
Y adivine que algo estaba empezando
Una aventura especial
Me enamore en ese mismo momento
Vino conmigo a vivir
Y en casa sone
Que salio de aquella revista
A darme una noche feliz
No se queria marchar
Solo queria

Y se reian de mi (y se reian de mi)
Como si fuese un loco total
Hasta el dia en que a todos se lo demostro
Ella me vino a buscar
Y fue asi que al leer todas mis cartas
Se fue enamorando de mi
Y al final ya lo ve
Por fin la muchacha

Dear lie
You suck
You said you could fix anything
Instead I'm fucked
You made things even worse for me
If I had balls I'd tell you get away from me
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my head
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me (out of me)
Out of me
Out of me lie
Lie lie lie lie
Dear lie
You're dumb
You think you've got the best of me
You think you won
Misread my vulnerability
I've got your walls
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned your art
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no
No more
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my head
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me (out of me)
Out of me
Out of me lie
Lie lie lie lie
Lie lie
I've got
Your walls
Now get the hell away from me
I learned your art
Won't let you unnerve me
Wont' let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no
No more
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my head
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me (out of me)
Out of me
Out of me lie
Lie lie lie lie
Lie lie
Dear lie

Performed by boyz ii men
I know you've been goin' through some things
The pain you hold inside is written on your face
I know you're 'bout tired of the rain
Well baby so am I but I know things can change
Well you can die, you can sigh, you can cry
'til you're midnight blue
But that's not you, no no
'cause I know you're stronger
It's apparent to me
So to you
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way
I know it's been heavy on your mind
Baby give him up he's not worth your time
Where is it that says you need a guy
Well you don't need his love to justify your life
So he can go, let him go, make him go
You should want him to
So can you
I now that you're stronger
It's getting clearer to me
So to you
Hook
So don't let your defenses down
I know somehow you'll work things out
Don't make your heart on no one else
You should just believe in yourself, yourself
Hook 2 times

You interrupted my life, little girl
Got in my way, got into my world
Now you're telling me, you got to go
It would have been alright about a thousand kisses ago
But now you got me loving you
Now you've got me hooked
Now you got me wanting you
A little bit of your love was all it took
You came along and feel me so
I've never felt satisfaction before
Now it's not so simple just to let you go
But it would have been easy a thousand kisses ago
But now you got me loving you
Oh, now you've got me hooked
Now you got me wanting you
A little bit of your love was all it took
Oh, but now you got me loving you
Now you've got me hooked
Oh, now you got me wanting you
A little bit of your love was all it took
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit

Thrown out by her family
With the midst of anger
Mom and dad can't make sense
Of her sexual preference
It seems the car
Just drive by on this night
No one has any idea
What this feels like
You wave your flag
Tell me I'm free
Then use the word fag
To fuck with me
(You have a)
Hey hey, a right to choose
(Gender is)
Gender is not the issue
Judged by parents and the public
With the fingers pointed at them
Well, I'll point mine right back
They must realize
You can't change whom you love
Gender is not the issue
That night she said, "I will be true"
Meant every word she said to you
(You have a)
Hey hey, a right to choose
(Gender is)
Gender is not the issue
It seems today to be yourself
It takes so much courage and strength
You were half the human as people who come out
This world would be a better place
You wave your flag
Tell me I'm free
Then use the word fag
To fuck with me
Go and wave your flag
Go and wave your flag
Go and wave your flag
I'm free, fucking free, yeah
(You have a)
Hey hey, a right to choose
(Gender is)
Gender is not the issue

Girl I'm in love with the feeling
The way you touch my heart
You are the good in my good times
You are the sun in my sunshine
You know you know you know you mean the world to me
You are my everything
When I'm with you I'm walking on air

Nothing better than holding hands together walking in the sunlight
Spending time forever with you

I never knew that I could feel this much in love with you
So in love with you
When I'm with you I'm walking on air
When I'm with you I don't have a care
Nothing better than holding hands together walking in the sunlight
Spending time forever with you

Spending time forever with you
When I'm with you nothing compares
When I'm with you girl...can't help but swear
When we're together wander in the moonlight

In a state of torpor
how could i slip away so far?
my body dumb to your questions
was letting yours decide on the replies
this cruise in myself
did lose all my head
oh you were my lover
now for me you just have tender eyes
feel the bounds wave
on my drowned face
Masses walk in torpor
deep to the northern endless nights
everybody seem so distant
hazy paths hard to clarify
who's on my way ?
who's on my way ?
no one's gonna wake me
as long as i veil my heart so hard
feel the bounds wave
on my drowned face
i'm a living sleeping pill, well
trying now to recall the past
anybody knows how to get there ?
sink into sleep with me and watch :
who's on my way ?
who's on my way ?
oh you were my lover
we now have all the time for us
feel the bounds wave
on my drowned face
sleepwalk in haze
recall the place
i am the torpor

I'm gonna kiss you in a special way
Make me your baby
I'll find a way to please you every day
Make me your baby
Make me, make me your baby
(Doo ah)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe
(Doo oh)
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
Ooh
You'll know a love no one has known before
Make me your baby
A love that we would share forever more
When I'm your baby
Make me, make me your baby
(Doo ah)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe
(Doo oh)
You'll see paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
Make me your baby
Oh, make me your baby
Make me, make me your baby
(Doo ah)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe
(Doo oh)
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
Can't you see I want to be your baby
(Make me your baby)

This is the house that Jack built, y'all
Remember this house!
This was the land that he worked by hand
The was the dream of an upright man
This was the room that was filled with love
This was a love that I was proud of
This was a life of a love I planned
Of a love and a life we loved
Of the house that Jack built.
Remember this house!
There was the fence that held our love,
There was the gate that he walked out of
This is the heart that is turned to stone
This was the house, but it ain't no home
This is the love that I once had
In a dream that I thought was love,
This is the house that Jack built,
I'm gonn' remember this house!
Oh oh what's the use of crying?
You know I brought it on myself
There's no denying
But it seems awful funny
That I didn't understand
Was it a house of an upright man
Up on the hill
There's a big stand still
In the house that Jack built
Gonn' remember this house
Listen!
I got the house
I got the car
I got the rug
And I got the rack
But I ain't got Jack
And I want my Jack back!
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
Oh, Jack
You oughta come on back
Oh Jack
You oughtha come on back
To the one where you live
Back to the thing that you built
You oughtha come on back
I didn't understand until
I lost an upright man

Performed by outkast
Oh yes I love her like egyptian, want a description, my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows, bitches and hos to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talkin' like that, man fuck them niggaz I'm goin off
And comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, bankhead is better for 'em
When they can let they throw 'em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' niggaz
Until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin' jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you ms. goodie, four-shoes, even bo knew, that you got caught
Like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas
Of our chillun, they fuckin' a different nigga every time
They get the feelin' to, I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my senorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real jazzy belle
See what if you was a playa real playa not no slouch
Havin' the very best of life lots of steak and perignon
Smokin' an ounce of weed yeah every single day was personal freaknik
Freakin' these hoes in polo clothes life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, lookin' into your watch I see
You weapon and it's depressin, they're diggin' up in your thighs
Leavin' deposits keep your closets open not your boots and drawers
Hopin' to get you sprung like bell-bottoms, steadily callin' me antwan
'cause you thinkin' that you my lady bitch don't play me 'cause you're chanky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the goodie we got danky
So thank thee, you runnin' that southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo' name
It's a shame, you crackin' em up and fuckin' a nigga like tupac up
I'm leavin these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me see
I gotta be feedin' my daughter, teach her to be that natural woman
'cause you'll be waiting to exhale while you other hos be
Dumb and dumber, yeah you know what I'm sayin'?
One two, yessss, ummkay, check this out right here now
See me ain't no good, in the black on black llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Strap stickin' together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog eat dog world, kitty cats be scratchin' on my
Furry coat to curl, up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl, cause most of the girls that we was likin
In high school, now they dykein' - nasty bitch
Havin' no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hangin' around the crew lookin' for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be, askin' me all about mine
How she doin' how she be, I know she's sippin' that wine
Behind my back they skwak like vultures
Off and on like trendz of cultures baby
Hey he, fakin' it like these sculptured, nails
But they can go to hell and lay with lucifer
'cause they burnin anyway, big boi user and abuser

We ride The Wild Sea
And if you want adventure,
It's the place to be
The sea wolves and the giant squids
Are coming up from The Wild Sea
And here's where I'll stay
For ten years and a day
We're on a quest to find hidden treasure
And mystery on The Wild Sea
Now the Sun she's shining for everyone
But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on
Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la (x2)
Now we're taking on water
In the Dead Dog's Galley
A man overboard everyday
Captured by pirates
In the isle of donuts
Rescued by some maidens
Who then ran away
And here's where we'll be
We never know what we'll see
We can battle ghosts
On the bottom of the ocean
Or ride the waves
Of The Wild Sea
Now the Sun she's shining for everyone
But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on
Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea
Captain's Log: 1978
We've been on the sea now for over three years
And the unbelievable things we've found and seen,
No man can write.
Things like the discovery of the Purple Pearl of Pinoche,
The mysterious island of Bigfoot Women,
The SeaGhost in the Isle of Dread,
Pirates on the sea - pirates that no man can name -
The underwater bison family . . . and much more . . .
Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea
(La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la[x2])
Do you hear that son?
That's the voice of the Sirens calling from the sea.
Quick! Put some cloth in your ears!
Don't steer towards the island!
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me

Yes you can pack your suitcase
I don't want you here no more
Yes you can pack your suitcase
I don't want you here no more
You know you done me wrong
And it's time for you to go
I used to give you all my money
And all my loving too
I used to give you all my money
And all my loving too
Yet the things you got me
I wouldn't do them to you
No, don't want you no more!
No, don't want you no more!
You done me wrong, time for you to go!
Well if you see my mama
Tell her I'm coming home to stay
Yes if you see my mama
Tell her I'm coming home to stay
Tell her I'm tired of being mistreated
Can't go on this way

If I cried like a baby would you change your mind?
If I told you I'm crazy would you come running back to me?
The harder I try to break away, the more I get lost in yesterday
The man that you know is just a shell, living without your life is hell
I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl, it's killing me, well
[Chorus]
I don't want to die tonight, but I think I might be going down
'Cause the only one I ever cared about is nowhere to be found
I don't want to close my eyes 'cause I might not see the light of day
I'm almost out of air
You're my reason for breathing
You're my reason for breathing
I don't want to go clubbing, I got no one to dance with me
I don't want to go shopping, I got no one to spend my money on
Spending my time with one glass of wine
Playing solitaire just to ease my mind
Poured one for you, but I drank that too
Anything to kill the pain of losing you
I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl, it's killing me
[Chorus: x3]
So I'm reaching out on this distant line
Hoping deep inside your heart's gonna find a reason
To keep me breathing
But I'm lost in this pain and I don't have much time
I'm so tired of walking this same old line
So I'm taking my pride, gonna throw it aside
Please let me breathe girl, I'm sorry
[Chorus: x2]
Baby girl, don't leave me standing here
I'm barely breathing, girl, I'm running out of air
Baby girl, don't leave me standing here
I'm barely breathing, girl, I'm running out of air

Every member here has got the lingo
And every member here is calling bingo
Maybe you'll clue me in, I'm open to suggestions
I came for answers but instead I have more questions
Crack this code
So I may see this road that you're talkin' about
Crack this code
So I can meet this lord that I can't live without
Every member here has got a smile
And every member here is showing style
Whenever hope is born it always ends up dying
My life's a funeral but no one here is crying
Crack this code
So I may see this road that you're talkin' about
Crack this code
So I can meet this lord that I can't live without
I can't live without
Crack this code
So I may see this road that you're talkin' about
Crack this code
So I can meet this lord that I can't live without
Crack this code
So I may see this road that you're talkin' about
Crack this code
So I can meet this lord that I can't live without

If you ever had a grown man
Let me put you in a grown man business

And when he comes home he don't help with the bills or car note (no)
And although he got a young back, he don't know about that real stroke
(that you really need)
I bet you thought that age was just a number
(just a little number)
But baby nowadays it makes me wonder
Why he let's you down at the wrong time
(You're at a stage where you trying to make moves and he)
Plays you out like a small child
(I bet his age got a whole lot to do with it)
[Chorus]
When the lies and games he runs on you get old (baby, I'm right here)
And whenever you're ready for grown man love come on (I'm right here)
And when you decide that little boys finish girls (girl come here)
Get back and get this grown man business girl ('cause it is right here)
If you're ready for a grown man
Lay back and get this grown man business
He's not really man enough to take care of home (home)
You need that security, somebody sexy and grown (grown and sexy)
He spends what he can, but mama I gives all I have (have)
Just check my track record baby, everything I do is first class
(I thought you knew)
I bet you though that age was just a number
(just a little number)
But baby nowadays it makes me wonder
He let's you down at the wrong time
(Girl I can see that you're out of his league but)
Plays you out like a small child
(so if you're ready for me)
[Chorus]
I got all you need
So make up your mind
And have it the way you like
If you do choose me
I'll promise you, you'll never go back
[Chorus]
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
Ooh, yeah

They call, they call me the fat man
'Cause I weight two hundred pounds
All the girls they love me
'Cause I know my way around
I was standin', I was standin' on the corner
Of Rampart and Canal
I was watchin', watchin'
Watchin' all these creole gals

Seven whole days
And not a word from you
Seven whole nights
I'm just about through
I can't take it, won't take it
Can't take it no more
I had about enough of you
I'd rather be on my own
Yes on my own
Darlin'
Darlin'
You know if you cared anything about love
You would have been front and center
Lovin' me and touchin' me
Honey
Honey
You know if you knew anything about me
You would have been much more tender
Ooh squeezin' me, caressin' me
You could have had about anything you wanted
But you messed it up
You had to be tough
You told your friends
You had me wrapped around your finger
You were talking kinda cocky
Like you had it goin' on
All the while you knew
That things were kind of shaky
You knew that you were wrong
Dead wrong to be
Mistreating me
How can we go on
Hook
Sugar
Sugar
You know if you knew anything about sweet
You would have been talkin' to me everyday
Seven days a week
Baby
Baby
You should have been givin' me
A little more time
But you were just much too busy
Abusin' me and usin' me
I would have done about anything you wanted
I was there for you
I was crazy about you
When I was sittin' thinkin'
I was kind of special
You were runnin' round
Hittin' every other girl in town
How could you love me
When you knew you played me funny
You knew that you were wrong
Dead wrong to be
Mistreating me
How can we go on
Hook
Deep in my heart
You were number one to start
But then you changed
You threw my heart away
Told your friends that
You were runnin' thangs
Why'd it have to be that way
You're wrong
Dead wrong
Tell me how
How can we go wrong
Hook

You're always hollerin' bout where I've been
You're always screamin' bout the money I spend
What's buggin' you?
Yeah, yeah, you're crackin up
I do your laundry and your cooking too
What more for a woman could a man like me do
You're bugging me
Yeah, yeah, you're crackin up
I spoiled you woman, a long time ago
I used to bring your meals and bring 'em to your door
I'm all fed up
Yeah, yeah, you buggin' me

Two time loser
Two times I'm a loser
Two time loser
All because I tried to play the game
Once I had me a sweet girl
Oh boy, what a neat little girl
I didn't know how much she really cared for me
So now I what real trouble can be
I played around with one of her friends
I didn't know just what I was gettin' into
I acted a fool and told her friend I dug her
And I came on like the world's sweetest lover
Now I'm a two time loser
Two times I'm a loser
Two time loser
All because I tried to play the game
As I want to lose you, baby
Once I got you back I'll never let you go again
I've made a mistake for the very last time now
My baby, please, give me some kind of sign
I want to know if you will ever love me again
Now baby, I want to be more than your friend
Other fellows can play the fool
This time, darling, I'm gonna keep my cool
'Cause two times I'm a loser
Two times I'm a loser, baby
Two times

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause, I'm too young to be in misery
Now baby, come back and take this hurt off me

'Cause I'm too young to be in misery, now

'Son, you don't have to say a mumblin' word
I know your woman done and left ya, again'
(She left me! she left me! she left me! yes, she did)

Baby, baby, baby, I don't know what you've got
'Sho' that's it's got me'
(It's got 'em! it's got 'em! it's got 'em!
Mercy!
But now, I've been to see my doctor, yeah
(I been to see the doctor, now)
He did all he could

All I can give you, is my very best
And when I do that, I ain't gonna worry about the rest
I couldn't give you everything that you wanted
I couldn't give you everything that you need
But when it comes down to giving you, true love
You never mind it always here to please
Hey, give me some credit where it's due, honey
Give me some credit where it's due now, baby
Give me some credit where it's due
'Cause, all I due to say for you, yeah, yeah
I couldn't give you everything that you wanted
I couldn't give you everything that you need
But when it comes down to giving you true love
You never mind it always here to please
Hey, give me some credit where it's due, honey
Give me some credit where it's due, baby
Give me some credit where it's due
Call out to all I do to say for you, yeah, yeah
All I can give is my very best
And after I do that, mmm
I ain't thinking about the rest
Have you ever came to me and I, I turned you to dust?
Have you ever asked a favor and I, I turned you around?
Have you ever asked me for something that I, that I wouldn't do?
Ain't good loving that I been giving you, baby
Now ain't it the truth?
Didn't, yeah, didn't it, hold me, didn't it, oh
Give me some credit where it's due, honey
Give me some credit where it's due

Back me down from backing up
Hold your breath now it's stacking up
Etched with marks, of my disdain
And you're the problem and you can't feel
Try this on, straight jacket feeling
so maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again
Trust you is just one defense
off a list of others, you don't make sense
Beg me time and time again
to take you back now, but you can't win
Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again,
but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you
And when that memory slips away
There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
and just the thought of you I fear
it falls away
Yesterday was hell
Today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again,
but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you

Double-O-Soul!
I dig rock and roll music
I can do the twine and the jerk
I wear strictly continental suits
And high collared shirts.
I've got a reputation of being
Gentle but bold.
And that's why they call me
Agent Double-O-Soul baby!
Agent Double-O-Soul.
They call me Double-O-Soul baby
I'm Agent Double-O-Soul.
I don't carry no pistol
I don't wear a false mustache
And you'll never see me carrying
Around a little black bag.
My real names no secret
But from me it will never be told.
I'm just known as Agent Double-O-Soul baby!
Agent Double-O-Soul.
They call me Double-O-Soul baby
I'm Agent Double-O-Soul.
There once was a fella
Who was down on rock and roll.
He couldn't get himself together
He didn't have no kind of soul.
The office put me on his case
And I tracked him down right away.
Now he's a deejay on a radio show
A station that everybody knows.
Call me Double-O-Soul
Call me Double-O-Soul
Double-O-Soul
Double-O-Soul
Double-O-Soul

Rock, roll, rock, roll
You take some music, music
Sweet flowin' music
Some movin' and groovin'
Rock and roll will stand
Take some heart beats drum beats
Finger poppin' and stompin' feet
Little dances that look so neat
You see why it will stand
Some folks don't understand it
That's why they don't demand it
They're out tryin' to ruin
Forgive them for they know not what they're doin'
Don't nick-name it
You might as well claim it
It swept this whole wide land
Rock and roll forever will stand
Hear those sax blowin'
Sharp as lightnin'
Hear those drums beatin'
Loud as thunder
Some folks don't understand it
That's why they don't demand it
They're out tryin' to ruin
Forgive them for they know not what they're doin'
Don't you nick-name it
You might as well claim it
It will be here for ever and ever
Ain't gonna fade
Never, no never
It swept this whole wide land
Sinking deep in the heart of man
Come on boy join our clan
Come on boy take my hand
Come on boy be a man
'Cause rock and roll will stand
Let's do it all over again
I feel good let's do it again
It'll be here for ever and ever
Ain't gonna fade

The lights are too bright
Let's turn them down and get to work
You're in the limelight
But I'll flip the switch if you prefer
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drowning by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I know you want me
But I can act like I don't know
It's nearly morning
So grab your coat, it's time to go
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drowning by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules

If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again I would spend them with you
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with
If I had a box just for wishes
Dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty except for the memory
Of how they were answered by you

I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
Living my way alone in the dark
Nights were dreary
Raining every day
I got down on my knees
And I prayed
That someone just like you
Would come my way
You put me in Heaven
Your loving in the moonlight
You're sweet as candy
Tender as roses
You took the teardrops
Took them away
Today I need you, baby
Baby, day by day by day
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
Whether I'm one of the many
Or one of the few?
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
From loving you
You'll become the
Only one in my life
You touched me and
Then I saw the light
You put me in Heaven
Your loving in the moonlight
You're sweet as candy
Tender as roses
You took the teardrops
Took them away
Yeah, I need you, baby
Baby, day by day by day
I found sunshine
When I found you
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby

Through troubled times, news of hatred, death and war,
Find signs of an end, but it may just seem to be okay,
And I'm not alone, when I say I feel enough to think,
I know there's dark in all things so I find the light and struggle on
[Chorus]
Lead me with a grip so tight, I'll move ahead, I'll break the path,
I'll cross the line, and still reach out,
Wash my mind or stab my back but spirit stays my friend,
You can not sway what's on the inside
Messin' around, but if it feels like serious, I fall to the ground,
And I pick myself up, so I can face th days,
Learn on my own but I get so much from things I see these days,
Vivid, so clear, I can't see why it's hard to understand

Na, na, na, na, na, na late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na late at night
I have counted everyday that she's been away
It seemed like a thousand years
And at na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na late at night
I'll sit and count the tears (na, na, na, na late at night)
I have counted all your lies all your alibis
I'm a guy believes just what he hears
And at na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na,late at night
I'll sit and count the tears
She's gone and found somebody new
She may be happy now but soon
He'll be counting everyday that she's been away
It will seem like a thousand years

Whoa oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh, whoa oh
I woke up sweat soaked in the morning
I was mourning freedom buried deep, mourning freedom buried deep
In tickers and broadcasts through power lines
Freedom buried in sound bites, buried in headlines
And we sing
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh, whoa oh
A nation in fervor has given up
No, no, no, no, this fight has just begun
With movements and revolutions as few and far between
As movements and revolutions will ever come to be
This scare is blood soaked red, so red
I marked down the last words that you said
As we watched this city
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Watch it burn
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Alright
It's beaten in and it's beaten in
We're coming back around again
It's beaten in and it's beaten in
We're coming back around again
This scare is blood soaked red, so red
I marked down the last words that you said
As we watched this city
Fall and hit the ground
No one can ever replace what we've lost now
Fall and hit the ground
No one can ever replace what we've lost now, yeah
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around
Whoa oh, whoa oh
We're coming back around

I grew up with love and affection
Know what it means to spread that infection.
No matter waht may stand in my way.
This energy within, it guides me day by day.
At times when I feel there is no way out.
I'll bitch. cry. moan. whine. scream and shout.
But what I'd like to see in the world most today.
We've got to SPREAD IT! SPREAD IT!
Now I know you must be thinking
There is something wrong.
How could I have the nerve.
To write this song.
Well. it's like I've got this feeling.
Stripped away of pride.
A crazy mixed up feeling.
That I just can't hide
Emotion is this great thing.
We've all got it. let it show.
If u can share emotion.
Then by all means let me know.
And if we wanna make a better world today.
SPREAD IT! SPREAD IT! THIS WORLD OVER! GO!!

A voice cries out in the wilderness
In a dry and desolate land
A voice of one is calling
Destruction is at hand
This is a land where no one travels
A land where no one lives
But a light shines in the desert
In the place where Darkness is
She will become the least of nations
A wilderness, a dry land
But the wilderness will rejoice
Strengthen the feeble hands!
Steady the knees that give way
Be strong and do not fear
The voice calling American Culture
Is a voice that all can hear

performed by El DeBarge & Babyface
I want a woman I can do things for
Give her the world if she wants it
All things and even more
And anything her little heart desires
There's nothing I wouldn't do
And if she doesn't get quite enough
I'll break down to her knees
Until she screams
Please give me more
Where tell me
Where is my love, tell me
Where
Where is the girl of my dreams
For me
Oh, where is my love
Oh, I'm the kinda man that wants a special girl
To be the only tender in my world
She's the kinda girl that wants a special guy
To love her to the day she dies
Oh honey, the shame about it is
You don't even know I'm out there
Seems like I feel you near
Are you in this room
Will I meet you soon
Oh, please come to me
HOOK 2 times
SPOKEN:
You know
They say love is a many splendid thing, baby
So complicated, but so good
But you know we
We can't seem to find each other, can we baby
I mean, I'm looking for you
And you're looking for me too, but
I tell you what
I'm gonna keep searching 'til I find you baby, 'cause
I know you're out there somewhere
I won't give up on you baby
Just please come to me now, darlin'
Please tell me

That's right, yes it is, eight days on the road,
Travelin' through the night,

And that's why yeah, that's why I've been eight days on the road, yeah
That's right yes it is, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night,

When love is new
Every day's a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation
When love is born
(When it's born)
It's so warm, soft and tender
(So warm, soft)
Everybody's willing to surrender
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
Don't let our love grow old
'Cause funny things happen
Then that love gets cold
So let's me and you make a pact
A promise to each other
For as long as we live
Long as we love, let's always
Always keep our love brand new
'Cause love is so wonderful
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
I said when love is new
Every day's a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation
When love is born
(When it's born)
It's so warm, soft and tender
(So warm, soft)
Everybody's willing to surrender
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new, when love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
It's so wonderful, marvelous, thrilling, serious
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
Every day is a new sensation
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
Warm, soft, tender
When love is new,
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love, when love is new
We want always to be together

What's it going to be like when they take you home?
Will they be disgusted?
No one wants to know of your big mistake
See their disappointment
That is why I am here
To make sure that you don't feel
Like you've done something wrong
I am here to protect you.
What's it going to be when you can't leave home?
Cause you'll make them worry
Better think again if you want to go
Because I won't let you
That is why I am here
To make sure you leave this life
Come to me and you'll see, I will make this easy
Why, live this lie?
When I feel that it's just not worth it
I've had enough of this life
Will you help me end it?

Thanks to Char Star for these lyrics.
Ooh...ooh...
The moon above is shining bright
Come on, boy, the time is right
Here I am (Here I am)
Take me in your arms and just love me, ooh
There's a mist of ecstasy
That's flowing over me
Here I am (Here I am)
Take me in your arms and just love me, oh, baby
My love is new, my love is sweet
Now's the time that I?ll be sweet
Hold me, boy, don't hesitate
I need you now, don't make me wait
You're the one that I adore
Tell me what are you waiting for
Here I am (Here I am)
Take me in your arms and love me, ooh
Boy, I'm hungry for your love
Give me what I'm in need of
Here I am (Here I am)
Take me in your arms and just love me
Oh, baby, come let?s share the joy and splendor
Of this matter warm and tender
Hold me tight, kiss me long
Make this night one sweet song
(Love me, love me) Ooh, sugar
My eager heart is pounding fast
Don't lose the feeling, make it last
Here I am (Here I am)
Take me in your arms and just love me
Oh, baby, take me higher with the touch
That thrills me darling, oh, so much
Here I am (Here I am)
Take me in your arms and love me, baby, baby
This feeling is strong hard
Any second now I?ll explode
Now's the time, now?s the time
Take all of this love of mine
Love me, love me, love me, love me, come on and love me
I'll be true to you
Do what you want me to
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms and love me, oh, baby
I'll be true to you
And do what you want me to
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms and love me, baby, baby, baby
I'll be true to you
And do what you want me to

Look at the morning sun, shining so brightly
Love is in the air, I don't care
Look at the smiling faces
Makes me know that no one can take your place, your place, your place
Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
All the skies are grey, now messing up my day
I'd never leave you in this leave, oh no never never
Throwing up my hands, not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay
Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
I'm tired of being alone, bye
Still in love with you, now
Let's stay together

Everything that i
Was taught to be right
Was it all a stupid lie
All the things you taught
All the battles we faught
And all the unforgetable thoughts
My brain is twisted now
The room it spins around
Everything I believed has broken down
How could you lie to me
The things you said I believed
But still I will not turn my back and run away
*chorus*
But i
Can't find it in myself
To turn my back on you
No matter what you (do)
But i
Still don't understand
All the things you taught
All the battles we faught
Tell me
Was it all a hoax
Was it just a scam
I don't (understand)
Still i
Can't find it in myself
To turn my back on you
No matter what you do
Your empty lies
Won't save you this time
'cause I know there's nothing on the inside
I'd agree to stay
If you agree to change
But your answer will always be no way
You were once my friend
You said friends till the end
I will still try for as long as I can
Our friendship's come undone
The burden ways a ton
You stabbed me in the back, true friends stab in the front

My love
I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain
Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love
[Chorus:]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For god blessed me with you
You made me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new
My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends
Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume, hmm
It must have come from you
How could you touch her
Lay down beside her
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really
hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time
You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets, uh
Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when my baby I found, oh...
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time (You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy
thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time
I gave my heart, gave my time
=Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and I only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
Cause you really, really, really, really
'hurt me this time
(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinkin' that
I'm gonna mess around some time
(I'm gonna mess around some time)
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and I only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really
hurt me this time
(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy
thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time
I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(I'm willin', I'm willin' and able)
'Cause you really, really, really, really
hurt me this time

When I was only twelve years old
I fell in love with you, oh heart and soul
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love is real, and it's oh-so strong
I'll be loving you from, from now on
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love for you will never die
Even though sometimes it makes me cry
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love is real, and it's oh-so strong
I'll be loving you from, from now on
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me

Just a pill and a dream
Died yesterday
Put a gun in his mouth and blew his way out
Just a pill and a dream
It's a suicide machine
She danced all night to the storm in her mind
She waits in the gutter
Someone she'll never find
Just a sill and a scheme
It's a suicide machine
She cried about the world
She slit her throat to fight it
Someone had told her she'd had it
Just a sill and a scheme
It's a suicide machine
Bobby had lost his secret identity
He saw his masculinity in a glass of Bordeaux
Just watch the show
It's a sparkler to his child eyes
It's a suicide machine
You find his wish
Get yourself some ammunition
Click!
It's a suicide machine

Sometimes I get emotional
When I can't seem to find the way I'm supposed to go
And all these so-called people that I'm supposed to know
They be the main ones
Smile up in your face, but behind your back they hate
So I hope you know
You're like the only reason I'm emotional
My tears fall like water so that I can grow
Not like I was before
Tryna make a change, I need something more
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'mma let the song cry
I'mma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry
What am I supposed to do?
Hold it all together when I think of you?
In my heart I'm thinking you were gone too soon
May you rest in peace, yet I can't sleep
It's my point of view
Got me in a state of mind, I'm so confused
Crying raindrops so that I can bloom
So what am I to do?
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'mma let the song cry
I'mma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry
(Let it breathe)
(Let it breathe)
(Let it breathe)
(Let's get it)
I may be cryin' now but I'll be laughin' later
No way, wouldn't be easy when you're tryna be the greatest
That ever did it or does it
Ain't no fuckin' time for later
And I know they think I'm sporadic
The bastard child of an addict
But I'm way too calculated
I try to love, but I never knew her
This money, I'm blowin' through it
Ain't rockin' red or blue, I'm unaffiliated
'Cause my bloods and my cousins hate me
I try to buy my mama's love, no she don't appreciate it
So I stay inebriated
I figured maybe J. Cole or Drizzy Drake
Would drop a verse and tell the people how we hurtin'
Guess I was mistaken
This moment mine for the taking
For all them nights I thought of suicide, contemplating
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'mma let the song cry
I'mma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry

This song goes out to all my nephews, sons
And lil' cousins, you know who you are
Mm, try to tell you what to look out for
Y'know I got your back
[Chorus]
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls!
You need a woman who will understand
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls!
You need a woman who will understand
There was a time when I was, wildin' out
Hangin' with the crowd, talkin' way too loud
When I think back to my, younger days
And my, crazy ways that was, just a phase
Now I don't wanna give you, wrong advice
But you, got one life you can't, live it twice
So when you choosing you just, take your time
Ele-vate your mind, good you're, gonna find
[Chorus]
You might be stackin' money, mountain high
So they're, gonna try, try to, catch your eye
But all that glitters boy you, know ain't gold
Some would, sell their soul, they're out, of control
And I'm ain't sayin' that they're, all the same
But they, all got game I won't, call no names
So take my word I wouldn't lie to you
'cause I love you nephew, here's what you gotta do!
[Chorus]
I, know what you need (You need a woman who will)
I, know what you need (You need a woman who will)
When you get tired of playing in the sand box
Want a woman who'll love you a whole lot
You need, you need, you need - you need a woman who will
Snoop!
(No Pain, No Gain), this life the same thang
Been playin' so many games, gotta find a slow dame
Sooner or later, no later, 'cause when he finally date her
He'll love her or either hate her, regroup or re'bilitate her
These are some real fly words from the wise one
I got my wife in my life, 'cause she's the right one
Better know it, better show it, every time I step in
A real woman make a real man, and this is definite
Yeah
[Chorus]
(You need a woman who will, you need a woman who will
You need a woman who will)
Yeah, some of y'all just triflin'!
Do anything for a little bling bling
All of the green and gold diggin', yeah
That's how you make yo' dealin'
To all my daughters, the nieces, and my lil' cousins
You know I ain't leavin' you out
'cause I know some of y'all be tryin the best you can
But listen to this:
If you be a real woman, then you can get a real man
I'm talkin' to you little girls
Tell me do you understand?
If you be a real woman, then you can get a real man
I'm talkin' to you little girls!
Tell me do you understand?
Tell me do you understand?
Tell-tell me do you understand?
All you think about is blowin up ya whistle
But it goes like this: Use your wisdom
No schizm, no -ism, get your own blow-up-ya-whistle

Looking out at the people looking in
Feeling good must be some kind of sin
Looking in at the people looking out
Feeling guilty, scared to move about
Looking up at the people looking down
Taking tranquilizers by the pound
Looking down at the people looking up
Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough
Ah, but that green grass on the other side
Is just an illusion
We all have our own confusion
Rich people watching the people poor
Trying to figure out how to get some more
Poor people watching people rich
You know, they call them dirty you-know-which
Ugly people watching the people pretty
Say they can't get down to the nitty-gritty
Pretty people watching people ugly
Say I sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me
Ah, but that green grass on the other side
Is just an illusion
We all have our own confusion

Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Don't you know
The lord above
Created you
Just for me to love
Picked you out
From all the rest
Because he knew I loved you best
Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand
I once had a heart
So trill and true
But now it's gone
From me to you
Take care of it
Like I have done
For you have two hearts
And I have none
Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest, yeah yeah, dearest, yeah yeah
Dearest, yeah yeah, dearest, yeah yeah
Darling, yeah yeah, darling, yeah yeah
If I get to heaven
Before you do
I'll try to make a hole
And pull you through
Woah, dearest, dearest, dearest
If I go to heaven
And you not there
I'm gonna write your name
On the heavenly stair
If you aren't there
By turn of day
Then I know baby
You know the way
Woah, dearest, dearest, dearest
Oh sweet baby, oh sweet baby, oh, oh, oh

God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tiding of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeled down
And to the lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

The radiation in the ground
Makes a lovely bubbly sound
The men in suits
Who don't eat fruit
Can't comprehend
The one-legged newt
That was caused from disaster
At reactor's core
A meltdown expected
To start a war
Now I bought myself
A lead ascot
It looks good but
I'm startin' to rot
Hey you
With that green glow in your hair
I swear I see a tear
In your radiation wear
Somehow it's there
Razorblade boomerangs
And iron hands
Crossbows and hockey pads
Are in demand
Toxic waste
In synthetic place
Can add an eyeball
To your face
Hey you
With that green glow in your hair
I swear I see a tear
In your radiation wear
Somehow it's there
Hey me
You know your gums
Are starting to bleed
I've got some shrink-to-fit
Mutated genes
And some bleak posterity
If they end up like me
I am Humongous..
Everybody knows I own the wasteland
And now may I introduce to you
Benji The Tap-dancing Mutant boy
"Hi I'm Benji
I'm a tap-dancing mutant
I wasn't always like this
I was born a normal boy
But now I live in this world of joy!"
It's Benji from Peoria
Don't drink the water
I implore ya
But his mom and dad
They were exposed
And that's how the neutrons grow
Hey you
With that green glow in your hair
I swear I see a tear
In your radiation wear
Somehow it's there
Hey me
You know your gums
Are starting to bleed
I've got some shrink-to-fit
Mutated genes
And some bleak posterity
If they end up like me
Just walk away...
Just walk away...
There's been too much violence...
Just walk away...

Drop me off right here
I can go no further
It seems life's too hard for you
How come I feel like hanging around to win
When it seems you always lose
When you're stuck in the middle
With rejections again
It's time to call your reject friends
And meet me at the bottom of the wishing well range
And talk about an hour of change
And it seems so bad
Yeah, it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had?
Is it too late?
Is it game over?
Will it get better?
It's better or will it
'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
He don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Things will never be the same 'cause
Willy's on his way
Don't throw sparklers or shoot them through the air
'Cause you never know when it's coming down
Breathtaking Soccer
Can be such a shocker
So try to get away somehow
When all you got is your bike
But Bike Rides are dumb
You gotta take a look inside
And find the secrets to life
Are down at the bottom
Of the underground waterslide
And it seems so bad
Yeah, it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had?
Is it too late?
Is it game over?
Will it get better?
It's better or will it
'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
He don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Things will never be the same 'cause
Willy's on his way
Can we remember what we've got
Before we open our big mouths
To complain about the things we cannot change?
Instead of always asking why
At least you've got your two good eyes
We could try to find our zone
Or just sit and cry alone
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
Now he don't got an eye
So don't cry,
Baby!

Baby i, think of you
Think of you a million times a day
Baby i, I cannot
I cannot get you outside my head
Maybe I'm crazy and if so it's because of you
All that I know is, I belong to you
Oh baby
I want your love
I need your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme
I want your love
I need your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love
Baby i, realize
You could take complete control of me
I don't care, anywhere
Anytime is fine it's cool with me
Maybe I'm crazy and if so it's all 'bout you
All that I know is I belong with you
Oh baby
Hook
Night after night
Dream after dream
You're there inside of my heart
Day after day
There's no escape
I want you inside of my arms
Baby i, gotta be
Gotta be the only one you see
Tell me boy, what you need
I will be providing everything
Maybe I'm crazy and if so it's all for you
All that I know is I belong with you
Oh baby
Hook 2 times

Gotta find me, gotta find me a part time love
Gotta find me, gotta find me a part time love, yeah
The next time, the next time he leaves, ohh
I've gotta have a part time love
Gotta find me, gotta find me a part time love
I gotta find me, oh got to find me a part time love, yeah
The next time, the next he leaves me, ohh
I need a part time lover
Now people in the cemetery, they're not all alone
Some turn to dust some bare bone
But I would rather be dead, six feet in my grave
I'm just a woman in love, each and every day
He came home this morning, asked him where'd he been
He said don't ask me no questions, woman
I be leaving again
Gotta find me, ohh gotta find me a part time love, yeah
The next time, the next he leaves me, ohh
I gotta have a part time love
Every time my baby leaves me, ohh
I suffer the whole time he's gone
Ohh every time he leaves me, yeahh
I suffer the whole time he's gone
And the next, next time my baby leaves, ohh
I gotta have a part time love, ohh
Talking about the kind of love
Wash my dirty floor
Talking about the kind of loving
Stick by me when I get old
Talking about a part time love
I don't need a full time love
That faithful love
May be your kind of love, no no, ohhh, part time love

The sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
One day you'll cry, I won't come back to you
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
You've got such a great, big beautiful smile
I wanna hug and kiss you for a while
The sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
--- Flute

In every heart, there is a drum that beats
Steady and strong, it does not know defeat
I feel it pound, and know the sound
Of true beliefs
In every soul, there is a memory
Of standing tall, the proudest we could be
I cannot fall, for I recall
We were born in majesty
And when the long fight, has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun
[Chorus]
And we will raise out hands
And we will touch the sky
Together we will dance in robes of gold
And we will leave the world remembering
When we were kings, when we were kings
Now is the time, here is the mountain top
When one man climbs, the rest are lifted up
With every step we're closer yet
To a higher destiny
And when we reach out to claim the thrown
Every man will know
[Chorus]
Do you remember
When we were kings
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
And when the long fight, has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun
[Chorus]

Depleted uranium is used on the ends of bullets
And on the ends of shells because it is so hard
Almost any armament is vulnerable
To something that is tipped with depleted uranium
In the cities and towns of Afghanistan
In the heart of the Balkans, the heart of Iraq
Not your Grandfathers style of deadly munitions
Its silent and deadly years after the mission
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Gonna cut through their armor, then cut through your lungs
If you make it home alive, youll still die young
A greedy gang of liars, yeah, weve seen it all before
A moneymaking scheme led by war-profiteering whores
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
They were throwing it away
Until they figured out they could use it for armament
Half-life, 4.5 billion
Half-life, youll waste away
Half-life, 4.5 billion
Half-life, youll waste a
Weve heard their lies before and we know theyre lying again
Feels like a deja vu of Agent Orange and Vietnam
Weaponry so sadistic, it is hard to comprehend
War profits surge with every breath by Uncle Sam
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
Depleted uranium is a war crime
We went to a hospital in Southern Iraq
And a woman was there with a very deformed child
And her husband had been in the Iraqi Army
And had been in the battles in Southern Iraq
And came home and they produced a baby
That was, very severe malformations
Both the Leukemia rates in children
And malformations at birth had increased by six hundred percent
And it was clearly an epidemic where all this DU had been dumped
It becomes a dust that can be inhaled
And infect the blood stream and the rest of the body
And it was the opinion of the doctors there
That this was caused by depleted uranium
They simply saw this as being a direct result
Of the war by the United States
Half-life, 4.5 billion
Half-life, we waste away
Half-life, 4.5 billion
Half-life, we waste away
Half-life, 4.5 billion
Half-life, we waste away
Half-life, 4.5 billion
Half-life, we waste away
The doctor said, Women at the time of birth
Dont ask if its a boy or a girl, they ask, 'Is it normal?'
The military denies first and then after the evidence builds to the point
Where they can no longer deny, then they do the research
Thats what happened in the Vietnam era around Agent Orange
And I suspect and Im worried that thats what will happen this time

Oh happy day (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)
When Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)
When Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)
When Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)
He washed my sins away (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)
He taught me how to watch, fight and pray, fight and pray
And live rejoicing every, everyday
Oh happy day
He taught me how

One person talks alot of shit and everyone listens
another speaks the truth and no one cares
the scene is nothing but blank stares
no one has a mind of their own
[Chorus:]
What happened to the music?
I can't hear it!
What happened to the unity?
I can't see it!
What's happened to the scene? It's all lies...
The lies are spreading fast like a nasty disease
the kids are gonna' agree just to appease
you're all full of shit and I don't care
You can take your rumours and shove 'em up your ass
[Chorus]
Who are you to judge-you're not a king
Sit on your throne but you'll be alone
Don't let your ego soar 'cause' no ones listening
you're gonna' be the one who's left behind
[Chorus]
This whole things gonna' blow up in your face
Everyones gonna' realize you're a disgrace
you think you've got the scene by the collar
But people will realize and stop being followers
[Chorus]
You think you've got the scene under your wing
but things aren't always as they seem
it's slipping from your fingers as I speak
You're gonna' realize your way too weak
[Chorus]

Verse 1: How can this be, my heart was just awakened.
I couldn't see my life was forsaken.
But you said you cared for me,
You said you'd be there for me.
Chorus: I love you, have no fear.
I made you, and I'll be right here,
And I know you will.
Verse 2: You gave me life, and so much more.
I heard that knock in my heart and I opened the door
And now that I know the truth
I will spread the word.
Chorus:

So now it's over, you chose another
this despite all of my best moves undercover
carnal fun was the basis of the affair
I was fooled into thinking that you did care
Ey! Oh! It's ok, you left my life in disarray
Ey! Oh! I'll get by, I'm not that other guy...
..who's probably been wondering where is it that you go
when you show up at 3 am with no explanation
another way another day another lifetime
well I might have been yours and well you might have been mine...
but I had you, I had you, I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed nibbling your ear
I had you, I had you, I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
it's not the best day, it's not the worst day
just a day that I knew would always come day
Such a shame that I'll never meet your mother
a part of me will miss you more than another
Ey! Oh! It was fun, you'll always be my number one
Ey! Oh! Sad but true, I guess I'm number two
another way another day another lifetime
well I might have been yours and well you might have been mine...
and still I had you, I had you, I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed nibbling your ear
I had you, I had you, I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
and everytime you used to smile at me, well it would set me free, and I could only be for you
(Your apathy cuts like shards of glass, each time I swore would be the last)
we clearly never shared the same point of view
(my heart is cold, now I've seen the light, my eyes are red, too many sleepless nights)
what's this? what can this be? 5 seats back on a flight to miami
there you are with a look of shock, you just can't wait for this boat to dock
call it coincidence or call it fate, I finally see you with your true soul mate
now I see the reason you wouldn't commit, you couldn't love me cuz you married a hobbit
still I had you, I had you, I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed sucking on your ear
I had you, I had you, I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
I had you, I had you, I had you even more
I fell in love with you, you just wanted to screw and walk out the door
I had you, I had you, something like 50 times
out in the sun wirth your pants undone I enjoyed the crimes

This is the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
Oh yeah, and I said welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
We stayed up all night long, laughing, singing in the streets
Oh yeah, you know The Clash, Ramones, The Pogues
Our voices hoarse, our bodies weak and ready for sleep
Lean against me, wipe your bloodshot eyes as I wipe mine
And from these rooftops we'll watch the sun rise
Ain't this the life?
Yeah, it's the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder, how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
With just half tank of gas,a hundred fifty miles to go, no cash, no food
We turned the engine off, every time we went down hill
And it's on with the show
I don't know whether to laugh or cry?
Oh no, I don't
All I know is that I am alive, I'm really alive
And it's the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
Oh yeah, then I said welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
We heard you there and jumped from the train
Ran up the tracks
All the while you screaming back kiss my ass
We're living our lives, I'm livin' and yeah doin' fine
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm doing fine
And it's the first night of the rest of our lives
I can't help wonder how is it we're still alive
Welcome to the first night of the rest
Let's hope this night of lights won't be our last, yeah
Welcome to the first night of the rest of our lives
Oh, goodbye

Days swiftly come and go.
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions they stir
The sun is gone.
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall
Did you think that I would cry,
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like,
Being alone?
I'll find someone new
(Swing) swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love.
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again
Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old,
They bend, they fold
And so do I to a new love
Did you think that I would cry,
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like,
Being alone?
I'll find someone new
(Swing) swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love.
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again
Bury me
(You thought your problems were gone)
Carry me
(Away, away, away)
(Swing) swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love.
Can you help me find a way
To carry on again
To carry on again
To carry on again

I put my head down on my desk
To help me get through all this mess
I fell asleep and before I was done
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock -
I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My shoulder's just a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!
The bell rang, class dismissed
I'm sitting here a little bit dissed
I stepped to the door,
But I can't leave
I can't feel the doorknob, my arm's asleep
I can't feel the doorknob, my arm's asleep
Who's gonna carry my books?
I'm so embarrassed
What if I have to pee?
I can't bear it!
What if I have to pee?
I can't bear it!
I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!
Corporate America makes pencils
For the man with the left hand
They make pencils for the man with the right hand
But what about the man with the numb hand?
Four hundred grand to see The Rage
From back here I can't see the stage
It's time to start my own parade
So lift up your arm and wave
I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My shoulder's just a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!
I feel no pain
In my arm
I feel no pain
In my arm
When's it gonna change?
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days
In my arm
I'm gonna slam it in the door
I'm gonna wiggle it around
'Cause I feel no pain
In my arm
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days:
Boom da bop da boom ba diggy diggy:

Are you sure your prayers
Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Sister, think
Are you sure your prayers
Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Brother, think
But don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story
Because He sees
Every move you make
Every wiggle of your head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry
You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you
He sees every move you make
Every wiggle of your head
Every wink of your eye

When you try
So raise your voices high

Hear you
Are you sure
You haven't been answered?
Now think
You'd better think
Are you sure
Real sure
You haven't been answered?
Now think
Brother, think

Love wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul (finding my soul)
There in your eyes (there in your eyes)
And you
Have opened my heart (have opened my heart)
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself
Undisguised
And I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
Oh
And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I am inside
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
And be the one to catch you fall
Whenever you call, oh yes
Oh, whenever you call, whenever you call

I'm having erratic dreams
Coming apart at the seams
I gotta get away
If I don't get away I'm gonna break it all
Everyone is trying to tear me apart
I'm going straight from the end back to the start
Doesn't matter where I run I always run into a wall
Oh no
Don't talk pretend not to hear
I'm always living a lie
I'm always living in fear
So now I'm gonna go figure out I'm not one of them at all
I ? like rats on the page
You know I right them all down and then I tear up the page
I gotta scare them out of here
Oh no
Oh yeah

I've got this somethin' to tell you
There ain't no doubt in my mind
All I'm askin' is to keep you near forever
Just till the end of time
Baby, I know where love grows
My heart is overflowin'
You're so fine and so true
I want to spend my time, spendin' time with you, baby
I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
You know you've got me by my deepest emotion
'Cause you keep givin' me the best of love
Passion and sweet inspiration
So rare and so hard to find
You are my journey and my destination
Queen of this heart of mine
Baby, I know where love grows
In my life it's overflowin'
You're so fine and it's so true
I know I've got it all, all because of you, baby
I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
You know ya reach into my deepest emotion
And you keep givin' me, the best of love
With every moment that passes by
This love goes on
It keeps growin' stronger
And the more we're together
The best keeps gettin' better, baby
I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
You know you're down inside my deepest emotion
So just keep givin' me, the best of love
I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
Ain't nothin' finer than that sweetest emotion
Just keep givin' me, just keep on givin' me
The best of love, best of love, best of love

I've read every book in the bible story
And all is every brought me was
another worry
Don't want god give me a jury,
See...there's no God to make
up my mind-
No God givin' me time...
I peered in every window where
I saw a cross
But I could never see just what they saw
In that piece of plaster on the wall,
See...there's no God to fear-
No God to hear your cries...
I'd prey to anything out there
If only I was given some sign to bear
But while I wait I'm gonna live,
See...there's no God to watch over me-
No God for human beings...
When I small I obeyed
his every word
Handed down to me by some
thoughtful blur
But now I am as big as he,
See...No God bigger than I-
No God frightening me...
In my image I made he him
and I gave him life
So he burned me,
the creature has risen and I
Think you can see just what it is
that's drivin'
Me around round...
We are the church we are good
we've got your
Millions God know we should...
[repeat first verse]

In you I found a love
Make me feel so real, oh, man
Sometimes when I'm sleeping at night
I wake up and you're nowhere to be found
You said you love me and you'll always be around
In you I thought I found a love that's true
But you used me, I guess I'm just somebody's fool
I don't wanna be a fool no more
With me you found love and you tore it apart, oh darling
You said you loved me and you'll always be around
Wait a minute, wait a minute
What you gonna do baby stop it
Don't hurt me, stop playing with my heart
I feel, you hurting me so bad
Can't take this pain no more, no, ooh
I thought you loved me and you'll always be around
Now that you're gone, baby
You break my heart in two, oh
Again, again and again

You push and push a people, what are they to do?
Soon this corporate run government will be through
See, it doesn't represent the people anymore
Big business are pimps, the governments' are whores
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need, we need a fucking revolution
We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We've got one thing you don't have, we've got, we've got, we've
Got the numbers, got the numbers, got the numbers
Got the numbers, got the numbers
To you the masses are not even human beings
We're dogs that will be grateful for any scraps you leave
But even dogs will only put up with so much abuse
Keep stealing like us, so we're gonna let loose
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need, we need a fucking revolution
We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We've got one thing you don't have, we've got, we've got, we've
Got the numbers, got the numbers, got the numbers
Got the numbers, got the numbers
We've got, we've got, we've got, we've got
We've got, we've got, we've got the numbers
We don't need more time to talk over a solution
We know what we need, we need a fucking revolution
We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We've got one thing you ain't got, we've got, we've got the numbers
We don't need your war machine, or your filthy blood stained dollars
We've got one thing you don't have, we've got, we've got, we've
Got the numbers, got the numbers, got the numbers
Got the numbers, got the numbers

Hey, Mona
Oh, Mona
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mona
Oh, Mona
Tell you Mona what I wanna do
Build a house next door to you
And I see you sometime
We can go kissing through the blind
Can you come out in the front?
Listen to my heart go bumpity-bump
I need you baby, that's no lie
Without your love I'd surely die
Hey, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Hey, hey, Mona
Hey, Mona

Please just don't play with me My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can
Tears fall, down your face
The taste, is something new
Something that I know
Moving on is, easiest when I am around you.
So bottle up old love,
And throw it out to sea,
Watch it away as you cry
Now a year has past
The seasons go
Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can
Waiting, day to day it goes through
My lips, are sealed for her
My tongue is,
Tied to, a dream of being with you
To settle for less, is not what I prefer
Summer time, the nights they are so long
The leaves fall down, and so do I into
the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me

There's a girl I think, comes straight from heaven, I long to know
Now all who has met her said she's better, than expressions, of love and soul
Now I thank faith for expressing to me, your love is more, than I expected to see
Ooh baby baby feel so good, ooh baby baby feel so good
Now I know, if I were to travel, across the waters, come here to there
Nothing on earth, would be hardly worth, my love, and there's so many ways that care
Now I thank faith for expressing to me, your love is more, than I expected to see
Ooh baby baby feel so good, ooh baby baby feel so good
Now I thank faith for expressing to me, your love is more, than I expected to see
Ooh baby baby feel so good, ooh baby baby feel so good
Ooh baby, feel so good

That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night
That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night
Good evening sweet darling
May I ask your name
You seem to be lonely
Well don't worry I'm feeling the same
Oh, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet
At a time like this
Oh it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
You're something that
I just can't miss
It's been a long time sweet darling
Since love has come my way
But I'm trying so hard
To find the right words to say
Oh, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet
At a time like this
Oh it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
You're something that
I just can't miss

You watch your war from TV screens
Immune to pain and human screams
You saw destruction from the sky
but never once viewed those who died
The haunting sight of blood soaked sand
That never burdened TV Land
You watched our nation swallow shit
and made the war a prime-time hit
The war was just a passing fad
Just yellow ribbons
nothing bad
No need to watch the senseless slaughter
of loving mothers, sons, and daughters
The haunting sight of blood soaked sand
will never burden TV land
You watched our nation swallow shit
and made the war a prime-time hit

Feeling not all right
My time's in a sand-slide
So hard not to unwind
Find some wall to climb-
Capsules cover the signs
My thoughts in a land mine
Some lights burn too bright
My nights hold too tight-
Slowed away outta breath
Won't wait to pass the test
Too late to answer lies
Don't even need to try-
Livin' in a fury
Life's kinda blurry
Dtin' in a hurry
Stories kinda lurid-
No time to worry
Gonna hang the jury
Broke up kinda early
All the bribes are working
Livin' in a fury
Life's kinda blurry
Dtin' in a hurry
Stories kinda lurid-
No time to worry
Gonna hang the jury
Broke up kinda early
All the scribes are working

If I were your woman and you were my man,
you'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb.
If you had the strength to walk out that door,
My love would over rule my sense, and I'd call you back for more,
If I were your woman.
If I were your woman, and you were my man. Um baby.
She tears you down darlin', says you're nothing at all.
But, I'll pick you up darling, when she lets you fall.
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass.
Yet you beg her to love you, but, me you don't ask.
If I were your woman, If I were your woman.
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do,
I'd never, no, no, stop loving you.
Yeah, yeah, um
Life is so crazy, a love is unkind.
Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me, and you don't even know it.
I'm what you need, but I'm too afraid to show it.
If I were your woman, If I were your woman,
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.
Never, no, no, no, stop loving you, ah, yeah.
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.
Never, never stop loving you if

Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go
If you wanted that star that shines so brightly
To match the star dust in your eyes
Darlin', I would chase that bright star nightly
And try to steal it from the skies
'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go
And if you needed a dream to keep you smiling
I'll tell the sandman you were blue
And I'd ask him to keep that sand a-piling
'Till your dreams would come true
'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go
If you wanted a love to last forever
Then I would send my love your way
And my love would only last forever
But forever and a day
'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go

Sweetheart
How I miss your heart
Beating next to mine
The right words
Were always hard to find
When all our time was fine
When darling you were mine, all mine
And I know, I know you had no choice
But I how I miss your voice
Singing right with mine
Flesh of my flesh
Soul of my soul
I come back home
All this darkness, cannot hurt us
Cause they made you from the light
Here on birthplace, don't be nervous
You will make it through, this night
Sweetheart
How I miss your heart
Beating next to mine
Flesh of my flesh
Soul of my soul
I come back home

are we there yet? are we even close?
or are we still miles away? are we done for?
are we all over? how many more days?
I can't take this I have no clue
when I really need to know
it keeps me up late I can't sleep at night
someone let me know
you don't know but I can't tell
are we there? we're not even close
not even close so far away!
got to get there sometime or another
I can't wait to get somewhere
anywhere but here everywhere but here
just get me out of here
I can't take it any longer I'm so trapped
someone lead me to an escape
got to get away but I'm being held back
just get me out of here
you don't know but i can't tell
are we there? we're not even close
not even close so far away!

Hes going home. Looks like the sky is burning, his head is turning
At least hes on his way. He will be there before morning,
much explaining, without warning.
He passes the blue lights, relieved they let him go
Why he never got home that night no one will know
There was this song we used to sing. It used to make him happy,
oh it always ended happy. Why cant life just be a song?
Where everyone is in love and the rest is a story untold.
He passes the blue lights

I'm tired of playing this game
And I won't play it no more
And I won't take it no more
Through with being your fool
And I won't do it no more
And I won't, I won't keep up this act
Not for one minute
I'm gonna pull, I'm gonna pull this curtain down
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change and
I bow out (I won't be hanging around baby)
I decline to take the pain
I resign the masquerade and
I bow out (I won't be staying around baby)
I bow out
Can't go on with the show
You're just a stage I went through
Now you're just fading from view - yeah
Time for a change of scene
Guess I'll be taking my leave
I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play
Not for one minute
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make my exit now
Hook
When you're left standing on that stage all alone
Maybe you will realize
You should have learned to treat me right
And when this final act is finally through
Maybe you'll wish you'd been
The kind of man you should have been
Now watch me say goodbye and walk right out of your life
Hook 3 times

Last night in the middle of a dream
Fiery red dog eyes double beamed
Tellin' me directions of my soul
Poured my life inside a bullet hole
I am a son of Sam
I got death breathing from my hand
I can't resist I cannot fight
I've fallen victim to his bite
I have killed six but I'll kill more
Sam commands my .44
I am a son of Sam
I got death breathing from my hand
Take me and strap me
To the electric chair
But you'll never kill me
I'll always be there

Here we go round and round and round
And back and forth you know
Everybody goes through it sometime
And that's just the way it flows
So we go up and down and up
And in and out the door
Even thought you know you've been through it before
For every argument that we've experienced
It's nice to know that you've remained composed
And I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This for the cool in you
Cool in you, cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you, cool, cool, cool, cool
This for you cool in you
Cool in you, cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you, cool, cool, cool, cool
Looking on back at all the changes
That I put you through
Any other girl in your position
Sho-nuff would've been through
Thinkin' about how you made it easy
Always there for me
Never once did you turn your back and leave
For every tear you've cried, I've cried a thousand times
Never once did I want you to hurt inside
I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This is for the cool in you
HOOK
For every tear you've cried, I've cried a thousand times
Never once did I want you to hurt inside
I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This is for the cool in you

I heard church bells ringing,
I heard a choir singing.
I saw my love walk down the aisle.
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.
I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.
Oh. All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.
And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, hmm
Oh, I know that the music's fine (oh, I know, yes I know)
Like sparkling wine go and have your fun
Laugh and sing but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, hmm
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much
You can dance, go and carry on
'Till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks, if you're all alone
Can he take you home, you must tell him, no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, hmm
Save the last dance for me, hmm, hmm
Save the last dance for me, hmmm
Save

Im strolling down a lonesome highway on my way to catch a dream
Its custom made for me my new best friend oh how I feel free
Yeah now Im going back with my head held high
Sweep me off my feet, live for today
Let the stars of San Francisco lead the way
So one chance in a million still means there is a chance
Excitements in the air tonight a special feeling in these neon lights
One second were dancing, the next were in a fight
Sweep me off my feet, live for today
Let the stars of San Francisco lead the way

Where is the love that I miss so much?
Where is the warm, sweet and tender touch?
I'm so tired of being all alone
I guess I have to
(go back home)
I guess I have to
(go back home)
Mmmm
(go back home to whom I used to be)
Where is the girl that I knew so well?
Where is the world where I used dwell?
I'm so tired of being all alone
I guess I have to
(go back home)
Mmmmmm
(go back home)
Mmmm
(go back home to whom I used to be)

I'm really glad I don't have nothing,
that's what the Government it ain't done for me.
I got no car,
I got no bike but
I've got no misery.
And all those divs with plenty of money,
they've all put locks on their doors,
they're so scared someone's gonna rob em
while they're out making more.
(Chorus)
Lock it up.
Cover it up.
We don't want a scandal.
Lock it up.
Cover it up.
That's O.K,by me
By me
(Repeat chorus)
And when it's all said and done,
and when they come home from work
and play bridge with their so-called friends.
But whoever found pleasure.
Scared of too much leisure.
Are you sure you're under lock and key?
(Repeat first verse and chorus)

Now love is one thing and sex is another
But they got together like bread and butter
People think they know it all but they are confused
That's why so many people get hurt and used
Now I'm waiting for you and you're waiting for me
So believe it or not, I think we're meant to be
We've been through the smiles and we've been through the tears
We've been though hell and heaven in the last four years
Let me tell you something 'cos I think, you're ready
I'm your boy and you're my honey
So open your ears and close your eyes
And baby get ready for a big surprise
Hey, you're the one who makes me happy
You're the one, I want to marry
You're the one, I want to be with oh oh oh
So please, don't tell me no, I don't want you to go
You're the one I want to wake up with
Now, when I first say, "You my eyes were glued"
Forgive me, darlin', I don't mean to be rude
But you were the cutest mama I ever did see
So many guys agree, I guarantee
But if you hurt me again, I don't know what I'll do
I don't want to be alone, I want to be with you
So many times you confuse me and I don't know what to do
But then again I'm a guy and I don't have a clue
Now, love can be a very complicated thing
So don't confuse it with lust because it ain't the same
I know, I love you from the bottom of my heart
You're God's creation, you're a work of art
Now, I feel sorry for those who don't know, how to love
It's a wonderful thing, it's a gift from above
Now baby, I love you and I hope you can see
It's about time you married me

I fell in love
On a very special day
This feeling will never go away
Now I can say
That with your love, I'll always stay
Look at me and tell me if I'm being deceived
Cause right now this feelin' is hard to believe
Who would have thought it'd be this way?
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?
I can't believe
That you are right here with me
The star on my Christmas tree
I wanna love you endlessly
And that's the way I always want it to be (want it to be)
Standing there when the lights from the tree
Meets your eyes
I can see
That I only want you
'Cause you're all that I need
Who would have thought it'd be this way?
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?
I'd never fall in love on Christmas day
I never thought I'd fall in love
On Christmas, Christmas day I'd fall in love
Who would have thought it'd be this way?
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?
I know that Christ came down
To endure my sins and shame
But now my dear we fall in love
On this very special day
This day
Do do do do do do do do do do do hey
Thought it'd be this way
Oh, no
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day?

Two kind of people I just can't stand
That's an evil-hearted woman and a lyin' man
Don't you lie to me
No don't you lie to me
Because it make me mad
I get evil as a man can be
You told me that you loved me a long time ago
The fellow that you got you don't want him no more
Don't you lie to me, ha ha
No don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad girl
I get evil as a man can be
Whoo
You know you been thinking when you sat down on my knee
You were fooling that moonshine tryin' to jive poor me
Don't you lie to me
No babe don't you lie to me
Because it make me mad girl
I get evil as a man can be
Now don't you lie to me, yeah
Babe don't lie to me, no
Aw don't you lie to me, girl
I said don't lie to me, no
Because it make me mad
I get evil as a man can be
Whoo, come on, well all right

I would have given up my life to be with you
I didn't know that you didn't feel it to
I would have treated you like my king and god
I laughed at those who said that you were odd
Hey!
I know you want it, you can't have it
Cause you blew it once again
Hey!
You think I want you, but I don't need you
Cause you screwed up once again
I wanna take a shit and shove it down your throat
I wanna snail you when I'm on my period
I'm gonna squeeze your balls 'til you admit I'm right
I'm gonna hide 'til you turn off the lights
Hey!
I know you want it, you can't have it
Cause you blew it once again
Hey!
You think I want you, but I don't need you
Cause you screwed up once again
Hey!
I know you want it, you can't have it
Cause you blew it once again
Hey!
You think I want you, but I don't need you
Cause you screwed up once again
I know you want it you can't have it
I know you want it you can't have it
I know you want it you can't have it

Well, I tried to run my game
She said "Man, that's the same old thing I've heard before"
And I'm too tired to go for your show
(again and again)
And she started to explain
She said "Man, I ain't sayin'
what you're playin' just can't make it
But I can't take it anymore"
Play somethin' sweet, play somethin' mellow
Play somethin' I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Play somethin' sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Well, I started to sweat
She said "Don't get upset,
'cause you just might break a string and that won't
do a thing for your show"
So I said to myself
I said, "Self, do you see what is sailin' through my soul?"
And I gotta have some more, don't ya know
Play somethin' sweet, play somethin' mello
Play somethin' I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
Play somethin' sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues
It's enough to make it light the dark
It's enough to make a bite just a bark
It's enough to make a body move around
It's enough to make a rabbit hug a dog
Play somethin' sweet
Well, I tried to run my game
She said, "Man, that's the same old thing I've heard before
And I'm too tired to go for your show"
(again and again)
And she started to explain
She said, "Man, I ain't sayin'
what you're playin' just can't make it, but I
just can't take it
any more"
Play somethin' sweet, play somethin' mello
Play somethin' I can sink my teeth in like Jello

Play me some Brickyard Blues
Play somethin' sweet and make it funky

Don't it make you feel alright
All you crazy people from the big city
Get on down to the nitty gritty

Everybody sing it with me (I like the sound of funky music)
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on
Boom boom boom
Like a river turns me

Spoken:
You know girl, all my life
I've been looking for someone like you
And you know true love
Is so hard to find
Since we've been together
True love is forever
So let's be lovers for life
We were meant for each other ain't no doubt in my mind
We were put here together that's the way love's designed
So that we could be happy it's up to us to decide
This uncredible feeling could be passing us by
What's the point in giving up when, when we're doing fine
We don't need to be lonely when our love is so right
I wanna be true
True lovers who care for each other (let's be two)
Two lovers, lovers for life (I wanna be true)
True lovers who cherish each other, lovers forever, true lovers
For life
I know what makes you happy, I know what makes you cry
I know how to excite you make it last thru the night
All that we been through it's been me and you
You stood right by my side
Don't you think that it would be crazy if we just let it all die
What's the point in giving up when we're doing fine
We don't need to be lonely when our love is so right
I wanna be true
Hook
Didn't it seem like things were just right
Didn't we have it all
Tell me girl what went wrong, why couldn't we hold on
Didn't feel right, didn't seem like, didn't we have a ball
What is the point in love, if we're giving up
Can't we just be strong, why can't we be true
Hook
Now we're true lovers for life
True lovers for life
Yes we're true lovers for life

Darkest of night
With the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong
Lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour
Has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oh, superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand
What a hell of a man
This cat of the slum
Had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone
Oh, superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' ta get over
(That's what he tryin' to do, y'all)
Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Woo, superfly
The aim of his role
Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean?
He woudn't know
"Can't be like the rest"
Is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out
And there's no happiness
Oh, superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Superfly
Superfly
Superfly
Superfly
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over

I think my girl got a mojo hand
And all the boys in town want her bad
And none of us can sleep, we don't think and we can't eat
Since my girl got a mojo hand
And they all wanna turn her on
And they're climbin' through the windows and the doors
And they're crawlin' in my songs, down my halls, and in my thoughts
And they all wanna turn her on
But where would I go if you left me on my own?
Who could take your place in my soul?
I was lost where you came among the tombs, among the waves
And if you go, honey, God only knows
I never heard the horses of war
Did my eyes not see 'em comin' forward?
Did I simply wear you down, with my nerves up so loud?
I never heard the horses of war
But where would I go if you left me on my own?
Who could take your place in my soul?
I was lost where you came among the tombs, among the waves
And if you go, honey, God only knows
I think my girl caught a mojo hand
And I feel like I'll be goin' back
Back to the beat, to haunt the streets of New Orleans
Since my girl caught a mojo hand
But where would I go if you left me on my own?
Who could take your place in my soul?
I was lost where you came among the tombs, among the waves
And if you go, honey, God only knows
Oh honey, God only knows where my heart would blow
With the wind, the chilly wind in October
But here I go, like a storm
Baby, back out on my own
Think I've taken all that I can stand
Since my girl got a mojo hand

You keep saying you love me
I believe that it's true
And it just doesn't matter
How much I love you
But in time you'll understand dear
when you shed a tear
That you are only living
in your tender years
(Tender years...)
In your arms there's a lovelight
and it shines for him
How long will it stay there
when the light run dim
You can just see the happiness
you can't see the tears
You can't see 'cause you're living
in your tender years
(Tender years...)
If I can't be your first love
I'll wait and be your last
I'll be somewhere in your future
to help you forget the past
And you'll know that I love you
with love that's sincere
I'll wait till you're thru living
in your tender years
And you'll know I love you
with love that's sincere
I'll wait till you're thru living
in your tender years
(Tender years...)

If you do want me, gimme little sugar
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling blue and I want you
There's just one thing that you should do
Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show that you're mine girl
Oh yeah
Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show that you're mine girl
All right
If you do want me, gimme little sweet talk
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling down, wearing a frown
You be there when I look around

I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am
I'm never a loser & I'm never bitter, yeah, oh no
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah, baby I want you, yes, you

Gonna pick you up now, carry you away, yes I am
So you better pack up now baby, pack him up today

When I walk away, baby, you'll be holdin' my hand
'Cause I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am
But now I'm ready to get you & I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl

Hey hey uh huh huh huh huh oh
Uh huh huh huh huh huh yeah
It's twenty five miles from home girl
My feet are hurting mighty bad
Now I've been walking a three day, two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty mad
But I got a woman waiting for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see she's got the kind of lovin' and a kissing
A make a man go stone wild
So I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on, oh ho ho
I, I, I, I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby calling my name
It's as if as though I'm standing at her front door
I can hear that doggone plain
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
Now when I kiss her lips
I turn a back over flip and I'll forget these feet of mine
I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on oh ho ho
I, I, I, I, I'm so tired but I just can't lose my stride
Come on feet don't fail me now
I got ten more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven, six
I got a five more miles to go
Now over the hill just around the bend
Huh although my feet are tired I can't lose my stride
I got to get to my baby again
I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on
I, I, I, I, I'm so tired but I just can't lose my stride, yeah
I got to walk on, let me tell you y'all
I see my baby just across the fence

If I wanted to, I'd have anything
I could ever need, anything indeed
But if I can't have you I'd be lost within
And everything else baby
Would really not be worth anythin'
And I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playin' this time
This is for real, real
And if I could, I'd change what I am
But without you baby, I don't give a damn
'Cause what I am won't change until you change it
To anythin' you want it to be
Oh, I'm putting my trust in you
And I really got to tell it
Exactly how I feel
Make you understand that
Love ain't playin' this time
This is for real
I thought it out the other day
And came to the conclusion
That I wouldn't last a minute
Without your love, baby
No, no, no, no, no, no
You really did show me, baby
When you walked out on me
Now I've got to make you understand
That I won't be bad, I won't be bad anymore
Oh, honey, this is for real
Everythin' that I'm sayin'
Every word that I'm sayin'
Is the thought of a brand new woman
I've got to have you back
So that I can make you see
That I'm not foolin' around, baby
This is a brand ?
And I really got to tell it
T E L L L L L L L, yeah
And make you understand
That Miss Ree ain't playin' this time
Ooh, baby this is for real

He told me, "Baby I've got lot's of dough"

Mother-in-law (mother-in law), mother-in-law (mother-in-law)
The worst person I know, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She worries me so, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
If she leaves us alone, we would have a happy home
Sent from down below
(Mother-in-law) mother-in-law, (mother-in-law), mother-in-law
Sin should be her name, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
To me, they're about the same, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
Every time I open my mouth, she steps in, tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low?
(Mother-in-law), mother-in-law, (mother-in-law), mother-in-law
I come home with my pay, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She asks me what I make, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She thinks her advice is a contribution
But if she will leave that will be a solution
And don't come back no more
(Mother-in-law), mother-in-law, (mother-in-law), mother-in-law
Mother in law, mother in law, oh

Left to negotiate with no sense of knowing
When freedom over truth has triumphed
Free to be lost and disconnected
Given as much value as free things often are
Keep me close to you. Don't let me be alone
Discarded but not overthrown
I'm useless, yes it's true
Keep me, fresh and new. Don't make me obsolete
I still have hands to wash your feet
My uselessness is you
I could be worth my weight in labor
I could be worth my death in favors
You could monitor my list of things to do
And you could overlook my anonymous service to you
The sum of my marketable skills
My part in the collective will
Abilities that you would own
And use in ways I don't condone
Produce and receive my meal
Discard me when I fall ill

Sitting here thinking, about the times I roamed
Different guys, that I have known
Of all the guys, that I have met
You are the one that I can't forget
We had our times, now
Good and bad times
I can't forget him
And I sure ain't gonna regret him, no no
Remember Side Stream
Where we used to meet
Making love, nobody but you and me
You and me
Champagne and wine
That's what you gonna get
Champagne and wine
What it's gonna be
Just as long as you can see about me
I'm gonna be knocking, knocking at your door
I want the same love that I had before
I'm a woman now
Full-grown, full-grown woman
You got me eating from the tip of your hand
I said, I don't mind eating, long as you feed me
Good love and good old sympathy
Champagne and wine
That's what it's gonna be
Everyday is gonna just be like Sunday
Everyday is gonna be like, like Sunday
Every night you're gonna have stars in the sky
Champagne and wine
I'm gonna give it to you
Champagne, champagne and wine

I'm sitting here
Thinking bout
How I'm gonna do without
You around in my life and how am I
I goin' get by
I ain't got no days
Just lonely nights
You want the truth
Well girl I'm not alright
Feel out of place and out of time
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
So tell me how you feel (I'm lonely)
Are you for real (So lonely)
Do you still think of me (I think of you)
Baby still (Are you lonely)
Do you dream of me at night (Like I dream of you all the time)
So let me tell you how it feels (Its like everyday I die)
Wish I was dreaming but its real (When I open up my eyes)
Let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love again
I miss your face
I miss your kiss
I even miss the arguments
That we would have from time to time
I miss you standing by my side
I'm dying here its clear to see
There ain't no you, God knows there ain't no me
Don't want to live, I want to die
If I can't have you in my life
So tell me how you feel (I'm lonely)
Are you for real (So lonely)
Do you still think of me (I think of you)
Baby still (Are you lonely)
Do you dream of me at night (Like I dream of you all the time, so lonely)
Oh let me tell you how it feels (Its like everyday I die)
Wish i was dreaming but its real (When I open up my eyes)
Let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love again

Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Girl, you lookin' so fly, do, do, do
Said I wanna get it on, do, do, do
Girl, you lookin' so fly, do, do, do
Said, I wanna get it on
Now you could search the whole globe but couldn't replace me
You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her
I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, "Ahh man" when they see me with Cardin
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan
I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order
So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov'
Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight
Baby girl, you hear me callin' you?
Now I ain't hawkin' you, just wanna walk with you
Talk with you for a second, spit a little somethin' in that err
Whatever it takes to make you come nerr
I'm tryna' sound sincerr, ay
Baby talkin' to me but I'm starin' at her rear and I'm like "Oh dear"
I ain't never seen nathen like you before
And you the type to make a nigga wanna open your door
And to the house up on the hill and the jag is yours
As long as you can prove that you wit' a nigga for sure
You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, ay
But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise
We can cash it or plastic, you choose
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom
Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight, yeah
Keep it movin', keep it movin', I keep it groovin', huh
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it groovin', huh
I keep it, movin', keep it groovin' huh, uh, uh, uh
Yo, baby girl you lookin' fly in yo' Donna K
Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin' hello, you still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow
So I let you know from the get-go you thorough
You a cutie with thighs and you live for dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese
I'm a goodfella, you know, I'm a made man
Got 'em winin' like spoiled babies in play pens
Put that ass up baby and I hit it from here
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here
Let me whip that, lick that, and I don't stop
Then hit the block with my niggaz in, my new drop
Convertable, tens and dubs, no matter the weather
One-sixty on the dash, chinky eyes and leather, c'mon
Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight
Party, party, hey, hey, hey

Never stop, never stop, don't wanna stop no, no babe
Never stop, don't stop, don't stop

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn

I've done got over, yes I've done got over at last
I've done got over, yes I've done got over at last
I'm a natural born lover since I got rid of all my trav'lin
Yes I've done got over at last.
No more crying, no more sighing, no more walking the floor over you
No more crying, no more signing, no more walking the floor over you
I'm a natural born lover, since I got rid of all my trav'lin
Yes I've done got over at last.

The older I become
I can't help thinking hard about,
What's really gonna happen,
And what's in store for
Us and them is bullshit,
And if we're gonna make it work
We've gotta care together
And see this too the end, see it to the end
(Chorus)
It'll take some time to fix it up
But that is something we must do,
With solid hearts and clearer minds,
We'll raise our voice and blast right through.
We'll stop the ones who fuck it up,
And show the world that they can't stop the crew.
The crew is me, the crew is you, yeah we're the crew!
The threat of war ain't over,
And yes I fear it's getting near,
With all this hate inside us,
It all may just start.
Here now will you listen,
Or would you rather just ignore
You say we have no future,
Do we have a chance? Do we have a chance?!
(Repeat Chorus)

We don't need to shed a tear
'Cause it's too late for us to cry
If we had known what we had goin' on
We would've never let this feeling die
We let a love vibration, pass us by
We let a love vibration, pass us by
I can still recall the feeling
Boy, you made me feel so good inside
Because we both had been used by love before
We thought this feeling we had to hide
We let a love vibration, pass us by
We let a love vibration, pass us by
Neither one of us played the game by the rules
I was too busy being tough and you were too busy being cool
The next time around I'll be ready
If the feeling ever comes my way again
I won't be a fool
I'll play the game by the rules
I won't let this feeling get away from me again
We let a love vibration, pass us by
We let a love vibration, pass us by
We let a love vibration, pass us by...

I pity the fool
Woo, I pity the fool
Yeah, I pity the fool
Yeah, I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh, I pity that fool
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Oh, I pity the fool
Yeah, I pity the fool
Hey, I pity the fool
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
He'll break your heart one day
And he'll laugh and go on his way
That's why I pity that fool
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
I say I pity the fool
I pity the fool
I pity the fool that gives her heart to you
He'll take your love away
And he'll find another fool to play
That's why I pity that fool
?
?
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're wondering

I will worship you
I will worship you
I will worship you
I will worship you
You are the lover of my soul
You are the one in whom I trust
You are the giver of all life
And you gave your life for me

Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me, we're waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold you warm me
And when I feel that I can't go on you come and hold me
And it's you and me forever
Sara smile
Why don't you smile awhile for me
Sara smile
Why don't you smile awhile for me
If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you want be be free, you know
All you got to do is say so
When you feel cold I will warm you baby
When you feel you can't go on I'll hold you
It's you and me forever

Turncoat, killer, liar, thief

Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law, go
State lies dressed up as evening news
We're tired of lies we want the truth
Broadcast by corpses courting you
We're tired of lies we want the truth
Most people they will never know
We're tired of lies we want the truth
With you or against you?
Then I am against you because you're a
Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law
I can't hear you
Turncoat, killer, liar, thief
Criminal with protection of the law
In your corner, makes me wanna, oh
Douse myself in gasoline
Civil servants fall in line for you
Too brainwashed to see the truth
You use anyone you can
Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh

Every night about this time
I go to sleep to keep from cryin'
Every night about this time
I go to sleep to keep from cryin'
'Cause my baby
She always runnin' 'round
Oh, can't you see what's wrong with me
I've cried and I've cried
'Cause I'm not satisfied, oh
Oh, can't you see what's wrong with me
Yes, I'm afraid
I will have to let my baby be
Yes, love is a thing that money can't buy
If you don't have no one to love you
You might as well curl up and die, oh
Oh, can't you see what's inside of me
Yes, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to let my baby be

(make you dreams come true)
No noooo hooo ooo ooo oo ooh oooh ohhh ooooh oooh ooh
You so busy
Worryin` bout
All of the thing you can to do nothing about
Maybe its time to change your route
Instead of pluggin in so much
You should look out
You have so many things to smile about
Like Love
For all the things you have ever dreamed
It could work out
So don`t stress out (oh baby)
It will happen if its meant to be
So don`t stress out
Things could work out baby
We go `round mmm
Only once
Don`t waste you time not having fun
You should live your life, its all you got
Like its always better to live than not
You have so many things to smile about
Like Love
[Chorus x 2]
Laid back in my arms
Is where you belong
Sunshine will defeat the storm
At the end of the day
[Chorus x 2]
So don`t stress out
Things could work out baby
[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Back porch probably with the squad n them
We got all that smoke now
He don't want that problem
Truth that make you choke now
Miss me with the nonsense
They keep calling me conscious
I just use my conscience, constant
Reminder when I see her eye
I can't let that freedom stop
The darkness that I bring to light
Like every lines a kilowatt
Kilogram, Cee Lo Green, see no star
Piling up, I'm wilin out
Surrounded by the wave
I'm on the island now
Isn't it ironic?
I got em hooked on phonics
And my momma used to think
It was just chronic, it was all bad
Now she see a G standing tall
Like the all caps is on
With the truth and tree
Fuck what y'all cats is on
I mean y'all cats is onbullshit
[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
I'm calm in confession to the preacher in the pulpit
Test me, I pray everyday that the lord bless me
So come test me, please test my patience
Test my patience

Test my patience
Either on your accord or it's coming from the lord..

Young mothafuckas on the scene
Whatchu thought it was?
Spittin' out this knowledge
But I never went to college, cuz
Never giving up until I move this product
And I get a lot of buzz, yeah I got a lot of boys
A lot of blunts.. A lot to stunt
I ain't doing that til I'm runnin front
Your girl, she runnin train
And I ain't out there totin' guns
I'm just tokin' tons, so me n Mick, we roll it up
All the finest shit, THC got me feelin fucked
3 Dutches and a Wood in this bitch
And it's lit, so I'm asking you what do you THINK?
Got the trees and the truth
Down it with the waters
Waves be surrounding us too
Stay grounded my dude, but I'm lifted
They probably notice that we rip shit, misfits
They probably notice that we run tings, it's business
I'm just lookin out for my family
You think I give a fuck 'bout the state of my sanity?
Test me
[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
I'm calm in confession to the preacher in the pulpit

And I would if I could, pull you right now
But I know that you're the type to make me crazy
'Cause you've got all my homies trippin' on you lately
I think you put something in the air
Your body's so amazing, and one could even say it's blazing
You're wrapped tight, oh, you've got it going on
'Cause you keep your hair nice
Oh, and I ain't even trippin', cause my homies hit first
'Cause baby when I hold you, I know we can make it work
So let me get your contact and a place I can meet you at
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that's super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, 'cause I'm super fly
I need that!
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that super on, and I'm super high

When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is
Wash up, make sure I'm presentable, before I lay one finger tip on you
Every day I'm in the whip with you
Crack them windows, let them look-at-whose come close, get a little whiff of you
My old thing in my newer coupe, ain't nothin' changed
Addicted to that, lifted off that
Every time I hear your name, I'm ready to let that paper flip
I've never been labelled as a trick, but I'll pay for it if I want it
I'm always high, stuck in the moment
Had a convo with one of my homies
Told me 'bout when y'all first met
How viciously you put it on him
I couldn't even get mad about it
I was there, one of my partners got it
Super loud but she's super soft
Softer than a whisper
Ain't no gold digger, but I ain't never seen her 'round no broke niggas
Come smoke with me
Super loud, super strong, super green got me super gone
That super on, I'm super high
I'm like Superman, 'cause I'm super fly
I need that!
Super loud, super strong, super green got me super gone
That super on, I'm super high
I'm like Superman, so baby let me hit that!

Do you remember when we didn't care
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all
Another heart calls

As deep as I need you,
You wanna leave it all
What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Talk to me

What can I do?
Say it's true

Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?
If everybody looked the same
We'd get tired of looking at each other
You couldn't tell the lady next door
From your own damn mother
If variety ain't the spice of life
Then why are some
Peppercorn lights so nice?
You telling me things
That you can't do
It's not that you can't
It's that you just don't want to
We are neighbors

Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?
You put me in prison in my own house
(Yes, yes, you did)
And expect me to be quiet as a mouse
(Yes, yes, you did)
When I see it your way
You let me out
(Yes, yes, you did)
But here is something
To think about
(Yes, yes, you did)
The good and
The bad die together
Nobody's gonna live
Forever and ever
The truth is the light
That you should know
Let's walk in
The sunshine together
We are neighbors
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We are neighbors
We are neighbors
We are neighbors
Whether we wanna be or not
Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so

What were you thinking? Why didn't you show?
Do you need to be reminded?
Where were you going?
Why did you go?
I don't need to be reminded
Where is your religion?
Where is your faith?
Did you leave it far behind?
Why weren't you worried?
Why did you go?
We all know that it's all right
Why are you busy? Why didn't you go?
Do you need to be alone with me?
Where are you going? Why won't it show?
You don't know that it's beside me
Where is your religion?
Where is your faith?
Did you leave it far behind?
Why weren't you worried?
Why didn't you go?
We all know that it's all right
Don't leave

No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin, light the fuse
This song's the smartest bomb
You make your own choices and decisions
You are invulnerable to influences
Sit down, line up, knuckle down, shut up
An electrifying organized crime
With planes and boats and suicide
Sit down, line up, knuckle down, shut up
You're so in control
You're so disposable
30 second spot video game
Memory erased, magnet over tape
Sit down, line up, knuckle down, shut up
Get psyched up listen to Godsmack
Dip you toes in the sands of Iraq
Sit down, line up, knuckle down, shut up
You're so in control
You're so disposable
No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin, light the fuse
This song's the smartest bomb
No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin, light the fuse
This song's the smartest bomb
Every day we've been taught to follow
Every day lettered to live one way
There is no one left to acknowledge
There is nothing left to say
Every day we've been taught to follow
Every day lettered to live one way
There is nothing left to mention
There is nothing left to say
Kill tonight
Will you follow?
Kill tonight
Will you follow?

If the sun goes behind a cloud
And you feel it's gonna rain
If the moon ain't shinin' bright
And the stars the stars won't shine for you tonight
If life gets hard to understand
Your love life is out of hand
Just come to mama
Come up to mama
If you need, a satisfier
Let me be, let me be, let me be
Your pacifier
If you feel like your heart's breakin' into bits
Call my number, five-six-eight-six-nine-six-nine, I'll give you a fix
'Cause I got your favorite toy
Guaranteed to bring you joy
Just come to mama
Come up to mama
If your soul is on fire
Let me take you to my only heart's desire
Just come to mama
Come up to mama

They cruise in unmarked vans
Your parts are in their hands
Control you with a shack of light
They're done with tv screens
They're using laser beams
You'll dream of microwaves tonight
Uh-oh
No
You can resist the call
Go to the shopping mall
There's just so much for you to buy
They're everywhere you go
They are inside your home
There is no point in asking why
You're so much happier
Your life is such a blur
There is no interest till you die
Uh-oh
(How can I resist you?)
Uh-oh

No

I remember the way you used to touch me all the time
I told you how I was the luckiest man alive
And now I hear you showin' off your new boy
And frontin' like everything's alright
I'll be damned if I let you know that I still find it hard to sleep at night
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
I just keep denying till I get over you
(Oh)
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(yeah oh)
I just keep denying till I get over you
Endless times I stayed up all night waiting for you to call
Lying to myself 'cause you weren't thinking 'bout me at all
My eyes are holding back the tears
My pride won't let you see me act a fool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let you know that I still feel something for you
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Oh)
I just keep denying till I get over you
(I get over you, till I get over you, baby)
Outside I'm smiling, inside I'm crying
(Yeah, crying)
I just keep denying till I get over you
(Yeah, over you baby, oh)
Can't forget the way we touched
(Every day, every night, baby)
And the way we used to make love
(I still remember how it feels)
Baby, but now it's over and you're gone
(I've got to say "Goodbye")
Hey, because I know, I can't go on without you

I can feel it in the air
Christmas time is coming
Family and friends have drawn near
Joy to the world
As heaven and nature sing
Hearts are filled with happiness and cheer
Oh, grandma's in the kitchen
The aroma fills each room
Children making angels in the snow
And in the midst of silent night, holy night, and everything
There's one thing that I have come to know
[Chorus:]
There's no place like home for the holidays
Everybody's singing, yeah, yeah
There's no place like home for the holidays
Everybody's singing, yeah, yeah
Presents underneath the tree
I think there might be one for me
Little children everywhere
Their looking for reindeer in the air
I hear a knocking at the door
'Tis the season more and more
As we celebrate the birthday of our Lord
Oh, grandma's in the kitchen
The aroma fills each room
Children making angels in the snow
In the midst of silent night, holy night, and everything
There's one thing that I have come to know
[Chorus:]
The old ones know, the young ones know, look at all the faces
It's good enough to make you cry
So good to be alive
[Chorus:]

Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time
We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)
I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time
The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time
The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (the cotton was growin' fine)
But that was another place and another time

Hold on tight
Wrap your arms around me til your knuckles are burning white
All your tears
Couldn't match the bitter taste of all these wasted years
You take take
Everything that wasn't even yours
Wait wait
You don't got a hold of me anymore
In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breaking's what your heart is for
For so long
I've had to bite my tongue but what's the point if the feelings gone
I turn my head
Learned I only see some memory but all I see is red
Don't don't
Say it didn't happen that way
I won't won't
Believe another word that you say
In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breaking's what your heart is for
Yeah breaking's what your heart is for
Yeah breaking's what your heart is for
And not a soul sleeps
Another heart skips a beat
It's every note that you wrote and I hope that you choke on the lines
You're wasting my time, another heart beats tonight
In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it out now
Breaking's what the heart is for
When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breaking's what your heart is for
Yeah breaking's what your heart is for [Repeat: x4]

Looking for a way out
I put my foot out of line
Really like to break-out
I feel so confined
American leather
The poinsous members
Not alone-not together
Their American leather
Saw you on a dark road
Brought myself along
Got a sense of conflict
But I know what's wrong
[Chorus]
[Middle]
[Chorus]
I know that kinda feeling
So I built my place up high
But you'll never find me kneeling
Cause I'm too occupied
[Chorus]

Well, I fell beyond the blue
It's just you and me, baby
I, I don't know
Why I can't get over you
Every night it's true
My problem is you, yeah
Early this morning
You were on my mind
Trouble everywhere
But I'm, I'm fine, doin' just fine
That's true
My, my, my, my problem is you
A biggest problem, baby
(My problem is you)
Let me just say that
Every night it's true
My problem is you, yeah
(My problem is you)
Early this morning
You were on my mind
There's trouble everywhere
But I'm doin' just fine
Sure it's true, babe
I can't seem to get on with you
And my problem is you
Every night is through
My, my biggest problem seemed to be you
And this morning
You were on my mind
There maybe trouble everywhere
But I'm doin' just fine
I know it's true
I, I, I can't seem to get over you
Oh baby, my problem is you
Every night is through
I can't seem to get over you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
My problem is you
I know it's true
I know it's through
Every night it's through
I can't seem to get over you, girl
So long, baby
So long

Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm stayin here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By this cafe club I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston, she said no
But you come home to me
And she said
Hey, ramblin' boy, now you can settle down
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains, so far where we can't be found
And throw I love you echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night til they come back around
Please come to Denver, she said no
Boy, but you come home to me
And she said
Hey, ramblin' boy, why dont you settle down?
Denver ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
Now this drifter's world goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to cling to
Somebody I can sing to
Please come to L.A. to live forever
Cause California life alone is just too hard to deal
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A., she said no
But you come home to me
And she said
Hey, ramblin' boy, why dont you settle down?
L.A. can't be your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee

I wanna tell you a story every man oughta know
If you want a little lovin' you gotta start real slow
She gonna love you tonight, if you just treat her right
Oh squeeze her real gentle, you gotta make her feel good
Tell her that you love her like you know you should
She gonna love you tonight if you just treat her right
If you practice my method just as hard as you can
You gonna get a reputation as a lovin' man
Yeah, you'll be glad every night that you're treatin' her right
Hey hey hey hey etc
Tell her that you love her like you know you should
She gonna love you tonight if you just treat her right
If you practice my method just as hard as you can
Hey hey hey hey

There's someone in love with you, you know
Just don't wanna let that feeling show
Because they're not sure that you could ever feel the same
But now he would like to take a chance
In hopes that you both will find romance
In case you are willing
There's something I'd like you to know
Girl, if ever you call me
I'm there for you girl, right or wrong
I'm telling you now girl
If ever you need me
I promise you I'll give you my all
Someone who will love and sacrifice
Who knows what it means to treat you right
Someone who won't change his mind
But always feels the same
He wants you to open up your heart
In hopes that true love might one day start
Girl if you are willing
There's something I'd like you to know

Darling here's my heart

You are well aware we're waiting
You are well aware there's something wrong.
You're making up for something...
One day I'm gonna move away
One day I'm gonna go and leave it behind
And make a lot of money.
The fire in your heart is out now
But you'll never know 'til it's too late
You're making up for something
I can't look
Wait.
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go.
Wait.
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go
You could see me and hear my swan song
Take my hand, it's stronger than I be
Roaming around so I can hold my head strong.
The fire in your heart is out now
But you'll never know 'til it's too late
Making up for something
The timing isn't all the great and..
Suddenly it's more than I can bare
Making up for something
Wait.
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go.
Wait.
I don't think I waited too long
Maybe if my price changes I'll go
You could see me and hear my swan song
Take my hand, it's stronger than I be
Roaming around so I can hold my head strong.

It's so wonderful
Being here with you
Ohh, it's marvelous
Being here with you
Can't think of anything I, rather do
Than to be here making sweet, sweet
Love with you
It's wonderful
Being here with you
I get a thrill
When I'm in your arms
Don't know how it makes me feel
When the feeling starts to build
Loving you, baby, stays on my mind
Just want to give it to you, baby, all the time
It's wonderful, being here with you
When we're loving, I get, oh-so high
Sometimes I feel can touch the sky
It's wonderful, being here with you
Oh, it's marvelous
Being here with you
Ooh, it's wonderful
Being here with you
Baby, it's marvelous...

Un cancin por mam
(spanish)
Me diste todo
Y mas que todo me ensenaste tu
Te llevo dentro de mi
Y tu fuerza me hace vivir, si
Cuando a mi lado
No te siento ya no se quien soy
Ni se lo que voy a hacer
Todo sin ti me sale mal
Tu estuviste alli
En cada nube gris
Cuidandome
Y si una vez cai
Tu estuviste alli
Alzandome
Que nadie sabe amar nadie puede dar
Un carino asi
Y por siempre el gran amor
De mi vida eres tu
Mama
Mama te queiero tanto
Te quiero tanto tu sabes cuanto
Mama
Reina de mi vida eres tu
Ll uvia de una estrella es tu luz
Cuando estamos juntos los dos
Solo me alimenta tu amor
Conmigo siempre tanto al frente como tras de mi
Y si algo hice mal
Tu perdonaste mi error
Siempre asi
Y cuando otros me fallaron, me enganaron, tu
Me llegaste a salvar
A darme fuerza interior
A veces miro atras
Y alli mismo estas
Hablandome
Me dices ten valor
Y ya
Asi todo esta bien
Yo se que otra igual
Yo nunca encontrare
Ya nunuca mas
Pues el gran amor
Solo tu lo das
Coro
No puedo estar un dia sin ti
Y sin ti no puedo ser feliz
No puedo estar ni un dia sin mi mama
Coro

Do roo, do roo, do roo, do roo do...
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
I have kissed your lips
A thousand times
And more times than i can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me
In my darkest hours
Sing
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
In our years together
We've got stormy weathers
But our love has been so strong
For some how we carry on
Sing
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me), ooh, ooh
You brought joy
To my empty life, yeah
And all that was wrong
You made it right
Our love (our love)
Our love (our love)
Our love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (oh how happy)
Oh how happy (oh how happy)
Oh how happy, ooh... You...
You have made me (you have made me)
You have made me (you have made me)
You have made me (you have made me)

A Hello like before
I'd never come here
If I'd known that you were here
I must admit though
That's it's nice to see you, dear
You look like you've been doing well
A Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell
Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So that it might as well be now
Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell

You have this feeling inside, and it makes you want to run and hide, you're so scared. You've got your hands against the wall you've never felt this way you've never felt so small.
Too scared to say you love her too scared to let your feelings show you know she's leaving but it's better than to be let go.
Another Will Hunting you think you know it all but this time you've never been so wrong you're only just a boy falling for some girl yet you haven't told her exactly how you feel.
She can't remember you and the last time that you met, she can't remember you you stupid fucking prick.. Will Hunting
Tell me what you have denied she feels the same as you inside.
Too scared to say you love her too scared to let your feelings show you know she's leaving but it's better than to be let go.
Another Will Hunting you think you know it all but this time you've never been so wrong you're only just a boy falling for some girl yet you haven't told her exactly how you feel Will Hunting

I met a gypsy barroom queen in Memphis
An' on the street the summer sun did shine
The sweetest rose that ever grow in Memphis
I just can't seem to drink her off-a my mind
She's a honky tonk woman (yeah)
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues (yeah!)
She's a honky tonk woman (woo-hoo)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues
I laid a divorce in New York City
An' had to pick myself out of a fight
Ladies they all covered me with roses
She blew my nose an'then she blew my mind
Well, she's a honky tonk woman (yeah woo, Lord, hey hey)
Give me, give me, give me, the honky tonk blues
She's a honky tonk woman (woo-ooo-hoo)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues
She's a honky tonk woman (woo-ah)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues
She's a honky tonk woman (wooooo)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues

Star light, star bright,
Have you ever felt the way I feel tonight?
Sparkle in your eyes, as the diamond shines,
Guaranteeing that you'll always be mine.
Let me tell you, for the rest of my life I'll be true.
Here to tell you this evening,
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you.
You can believe that there ain't nothing in this world that I'd rather do.
Now and forever my heart belongs to you.
Now and forever, for the rest of my life I love you.
And it's alright, go ahead and cry,
I'm so happy now that I could die.
(I understand your tears)
And you touched my soul,
More than you know.
So afraid that you would tell me.
Let me tell you, for the rest of my life I'll be true.
Here to tell you this evening,
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you.
You can believe that there ain't nothing in this world that I'd rather do.
Now and forever my heart belongs to you.
Now and forever, for the rest of my life I love you.
The countdown has begun until the day,
And I know that we're gonna be together come what may,
And if you want me and need to always be there,
Constantly, patiently, taking good care,
I'll be there, you'll know I'll be there.
For the rest of my life I'll be true.
And the rest of my days and nights belong to you.
You can believe that there's nothing in this world that I'd rather do.
Now and forever my heart belongs to you.
Now and forever, for the rest of my life I love you.
I love you.

Well
Yes you did
You know I talk
To my baby
I talk to her
Late last night
And she said
That she's still waiting
She said that if I hurry home
Everything gonna be alright
She said "I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love"
So I went to the train station
And bought a one way ticket back home
You see, I realized what I was missing
Because I heard it, I heard it in the little
That little girl's voice
She said "I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love"
Oh that's what she said
Never get enough of your love
She said I never, never, never, never get enough of your love
Now I don't know
If you've had this problem
But if you did
You better take my, take my advice
You better stay, stay at home
And never leave, never leave the little girl alone
Or you may never hear her say
"I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love"
She said "I don't mind waiting 'cause I never can get enough of your love"
And you don't know how good it made me feel
When I heard her say never
Never get enough of my love
You don't know how good it made me feel
Oh no I never, never get enough
Never get enough
She said "I never"

You're fired.
You stupid fucking piece of shit.
You're fired.
You're nothing but a hypocrite.
You're fired.
Conformist fucking chickenshit.
Douse the dream in kerosene.
You're fired.
You only sing so phones can ring.
You're fired.
Here's something your phone can sing.
You're fired.
Fuck this, fuck that, fuck compromising.
Watch it all fall apart.
Murder the beast and feast on the heart.
Watch the industry just fall apart.
Off with the head and the body discard.

Sitting by the window all day thinking of you
Watching the days go by, I started to cry
But they weren't tears of sadness they only meant I love you
And I wanna tell you girl that I, oh, I
I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you
It's written in the melody I adore you
I wrote my love a symphony
To show you there's nothing I won't do
Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you
If there's a way I'll do it all for you
Anything you want me to
You know I would do
People think I'm crazy, they say I'm just a nothing
Letting my life pass me by, believing you're with me
Well I can't speak for no one but in my heart I know you love me, yes
And that's why I'll always tell you I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you
It's written in the melody I adore you
I wrote my love a symphony
To show you there's nothing I won't do
Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you
If there's a way I'll do it all for you
Anything you want me to
You know I would do
I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you
It's written in the melody I adore you
I wrote my love a symphony
To show you there's nothing I won't do
Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you
If there's a way I'll do it all for you
Anything you want me to
You know I would do
Baby, you know I would do, baby, you know I would do
I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you
It's written in the melody I adore you
I wrote my love a symphony
To show you there's nothing I won't do
Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you
If there's a way I'll do it all for you
Anything you want me to
You know I would do

Clara would be proud to know us
We've taken it to the end
Where the grey tuens to black
And the white just begins-
We live everyday on the water
The night just kills the pain
From the suffering that was
We are no stronger-we are dust-
Down in the crowd we're down
on our knees
Wanna get out but
don't wanna succeed
We're the red-eyed legends
of the night before
We're the dead mind babies
of the T.V. war-
Living in a rectory of sin
Against the currents we all swim
Cageless wonders of sometime when
The paper icon's chase will end-

One of these days an' it won't be long, yeah
You gonna look for me an' I'll be gone
I believe, I say I believe right now
Hey, hey, hey, baby
You tryin' to make a fool of me, now
You goin' 'round here with your head so hard, yeah
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
I believe, I say I believe right now
Hey, hey, hey, baby
You tryin' to make a fool of me, now
Now last night you were dreamin' when I heard you say, yeah
"Ho Johnny", when you know my name is Ray
I believe, I say I believe right now, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh, baby
You're tryin' to make a fool of me, now
Oh!
You're gonna 'round here with your head so hard, yeah
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
I believe, I say I believe right now, yeah
Hey, hey, hey baby
You're tryin' to make a fool of me now, hey
Yeah!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

Have you ever been in trouble
Then you know just how I feel whoa-oh
Please somebody help me
Don't let me down trouble is all I found
Poor me
If it wasn't for trouble bad luck and trouble
I wouldn't have no luck at all whoa-oh
Please somebody help me
Don't let me down trouble is all I found
Poor me
A rich man willed me a million dollars
But his lawyer said
When he stood up to sign his name
He dropped dead whoa-oh
Please somebody help me
Don't let me down trouble is all I found
Poor me

It must have broke your poor little heart
When the boys used to say,
You looked better in the dark.
Oooh but now they'd give all they learnt in school
To be somewhere in the dark with you (Oh yes they would)
You know the teacher would ask the questions
And you, would always raise your hand
Oooh but somehow you never got your turn
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn (Oh yes I did)
(Chorus)
Homely girl, She was so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
Homely girl you used to be lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah
There was a boy who used to sit beside you
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through
Oooh you were beautiful to me
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did
I was the only one who offered
To carry your books
Took all the stares and laughter
With the dirty looks
But I saw then what they see now
They all want to ask you for a date
They don't know how, they don't know how
(Chorus)
Homely girl, She was so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
Homely girl you used to be lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah
Oooh first they want a chance to hold you
Then they want a chance to try to control you
Oh no, don't you know I got to say it

When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends
How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one
'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
Letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

See genetics singing out
The face of this race
The work of creation shouting out
Do you see the same or do you see
What's unique
With the Flesh, the Blood, the Bones,
Here come the clones
With all their garbage, with all their splendor
The breath of the spirit
We can never render
No blade identical, no heart impermeable
How can you manufacture the holy spirit
Father bring life to Blood, to Bones,
Here come the clones
With all their garbage, with all their splendor
The breath of the spirit we can never render
The Bodies are inhabited with life,
The son of man
The power in no hierarchy forthcoming
Even the bereft of life will stand
As the trumpet drones raise the bones
Prophesy to light, no man can elevate alone
We're not so different, we're not the same
Hating brother's quality and beauty
Who are we?
Human being's the name
With flesh, with moans
We throw the stones
At all the garbage, and all the splendor
At the spirit and hope that it can render
We fall.

Its an elusive thing
This love of which we sing
What are we doing,
What are we doing?
And I will give you anything,
Just please dont stop singing,
The world would stop spinning
around
Youre such a lovely thing
But there is ice forming
Upon your pretty wings
What are you protecting?
And I will give you everything,
And you can wear this ring,
But you only love me,
you only love me when Im leaving,
you only love me cause Im leaving,
you only love me when Im leaving,
you only love me cause Im leaving tonight
youve such a lovely thing,
but there is ice for me,
upon your pretty wings,
why are you lying?
And I will give you everything
Just please dont stop singing,
The world would stop spinning
around
Its an elusive thing,
This love of which we sing,
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?
And I will give you anything,
And you can wear my ring,
But you only love me,
You only love me when Im leaving,
You only love me cause Im leaving,
You only love me cause Im leaving,
You only love me when Im leaving.

I'm a Lexicon devil with a battered brain
Searching for a future the world's my aim
So gimme gimme your hands gimme gimme your minds
Gimme gimme your hands gimme gimme your minds
Gimme gimme this gimme gimme that
I want toy tin soldiers that can push and shove
I want gunboy rovers that will wreck this club
I'll build you up and level your heads
We'll run it my way cold men and politics dead...
(Chorus)
I'll get silver guns to drip old blood
Let's get this established joke a shove
We're gonna wreak havok on this rancid mill
I'm searchin' for somethin' even if I'm killed...
(Chorus)
Empty out your pockets- you don't need their change
I'm giving you the power to rearrange
Together we'll run to the highest prop
Tear it down and let it drop... away...
(chorus)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a cold man to hurt his woman
And watch her walk away crying
When all along, he knows he's wrong
Being so hard on a woman who's trying
I was so unkind to hurt you so
Going out of my mind
I just gotta let you know that
Baby, I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
I remember you said
You would always care
Until death should we do part
Baby, surely must be our destiny
To die the death of a broken heart
So before I go, a wandering rover
Let's get together
Talk this thing over now
Baby, I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
If our love is so wrong?
It just seems wrong
That our love could never be
You could be anywhere
Baby, I wouldn't care
If I thought that you're leaving me
All the chains in the world
(Couldn't hold me, couldn't hold me)
Like the? our your love
(Controls me, controls me)
Baby, I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
Baby, I just can't let you go (oh, yeah)
I realize I hurt you so (ooh, yeah)
Our love, surely can we mend it
(Surely we can we mend it)
It's just a little misunderstanding
Baby (baby)
I just can't let you go

Said to the man at the railroad station,
"I want a ticket, just for one."
He said, "Well, if you insist. Where you want to go, Miss?"
Oh, destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't love me no more
This old world ain't got no back door
He looked at me with a funny face and said,
"Are you sure you want to go just anyplace?"
I said, "If you ever loved someone, the way I loved that man,
Surely Mr. ticket agent, you should understand."
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world ain't got no back door
'Cause every day, it would swing both ways
And we'd go on back to happy yesterdays
When I loved him tenderly
And all he needed was me.
As I stepped through the window of the train
I thought I heard my baby call my name
But it was just the conductor saying,
"Which stop would you prefer?"
Oh, destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't love me no more
This old world ain't got no back door
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care

Oh, I'm goin' to the river, gonna
Jump overboard and drown
I'm goin' to the river, gonna
Jump overboard and drown
Because the girl I love
She just done let, let me down
When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
I never thought I would be
I would be the one to cry
Well, if you see my mama, tell
Her good-bye for me
If you see my mama, tell
Her good-bye for me
I'm tired of livin'
Livin' in misery

There's a certain girl I've been after a long, long time
What's her name?
I can't tell you
Ahh
I can't reveal her name until I get her
What's her name?
I can't tell you
No
I've tried time and time again
Still we're introduced as nothing but friends
There's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
What's her name?

No
There's a certain chick I've been sweet on since I met her
What's her name?
I can't tell you
No
No, I can't tell her name, I won't reveal it until I get her
What's her name?
I can't tell you
No
One day I'll wake up and say
Just to have you, I'll be your slave

There never was a fool, like a fool in love
I oughta know
But I can tell you one thing, this fool's had enough
And it shows
When we were making love
I wonder who you were thinking of
Was it you and me, or you and he?
I gave my all to you and you walked all over me
Girl, can't you see?
I don't want to cry for love again
No more do or die for love again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love
There never was a moment I didn't need your love
I loved you so baby
Far too many lonely nights, it hurt so much
Girl just go
When we were making love
I wonder who you were thinking of
Was it you and me, or you and he?
I gave my all to you and you walked all over me
Girl, can't you see?
I don't want to cry for love again
No more do or die for love again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say that I don't want you
I don't want to cry for love again
No more 'do or die for love' again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love
I'm goin' on, goin' on with my life
Wipe my tears away, I don't wanna cry
No more 'do or die', sorry, I have to say
I'm goin' on, gotta go on with my life
Wipe my tears away, I don't wanna cry
No more 'do or die', sorry, I have to say
Goodbye, my love, goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love, goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love

Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
You know I love you girl
But I want you to do right
If you would only straighten up
We'd have a good life
And if you don't believe me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
You do all your parading
With every guy in town
I try to find you, woman
And you're nowhere to be found
But if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
You know I love you woman
I can't tell you anymore
If you don't straighten up
I'm gonna walk right out of that door
And if you don't believe me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, oh yes, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, don't you know

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Now where's your picket fence love
And where's that shiny car
And did it ever get you far
You never seemed so tense love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are
And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on
And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song and you sing along but you never tell
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song
I hope that it will treat you well
You can sing along
I hope that it puts you through hell

What is this feelin' I have in my heart for you?
Ah, baby, oh baby
Is one of the things I can't explain to you
And that's how I feel about you
You kissin' me a thousand times
Slowly drivin' me out of my mind, oh ho, baby, yeah
I'm really crazy 'bout the way you can be, my baby, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me, ooh baby, oh yeah
You go out late at night, that you do
Knowin' thing with you and me ain't right, no
My love, love, love, my love, love
Baby, baby, somebody need to help me now, yeah
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, baby, yeah, say

Crazy 'bout the way you can be, yes I am
Hey baby, hey baby, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me, baby, yeah
I'm yours, I'm yours, yours to keep, baby, yeah
I got to say, your love me it's somethin'
To put me on my feet, baby

My love, love, love, baby
Won't you, babe
Hey, let me come on into your love, baby
Oh ho, all you got to do hold me tender, love me long
Hey baby, yeah I wanna know, I got to know
What is this feelin'?
What is this feelin'?

He says that for the punk rock scene he'd give his fucking life
But he only ever paid to see a show once, maybe twice
Instead he stands outside the halls and pan handles for beer
Then sneaks into the hall to deface the bathroom mirror
A N A R C H Y
His name is Captain Anarchy but only in his mind
A N A R C H Y
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one till he dies
You never saw an anarchist with such perfect hair
Or so many ten dollar spikes or so much punk rock gear
He said he used his welfare checks to buy his boots and plaids
In reality it was paid for by his mommy and his dad
A N A R C H Y
His name is Captain Anarchy but only in his mind
A N A R C H Y
He's anarchy incarnate but only in his
You know he just can't see, oi, oi, oi
It's up to you and me oi, oi, oi
I don't want to be oi, oi, oi
Fighting, let's stride for some unity
It's unity, unity, unity

Injustice runs rampant in society
You can even find it in our own pretty democracy
Run!...Well no!
Or hide in a 9 to 5 and don't care to know
Impoverished and homeless don't have a choice
Well, why should they? The money took their voice
And it flows...
Only prepare at the next media scare...
Turn the TV on and tune out the sun
Opinions decisions seem so black and white
When we allow the media to chose our fight
Never talk of sex but condemn all abortion
Christian message is warped in transmitted distortion
Fell the sea sickening rush of the great capitalist flush
Spiraling down
The destruction of all that's in our way
When times get rough its time to pray
A Nation of greed
American apathy
A path and a blown away seed
Promoting self is the American way
Globalization of greed
Spiritual apathy
A path and a hollow seed
Structural collapse is on the way
We're living, survival of the richest
Echoes rise up from the pit
As the pendulum cuts them down
And our American world, spins around
Money makes money, while the poor can only get poorer
Our economic equations include the bottom mans horror
Some free men sit in prisons while some slaves sit in office
Prejudice issues manage to linger
We need reconciliation not pointing a finger
So what is our ticket out now
Where do we find truth?
Many have lost their minds or died
So we could indulge in our American pride
And now we glance at some at the corner
Who have been discarded and junked away
And forced they work up scams
To exist with me and you another day
Consume. Pollute. Hate. Destroy
Let go of possession, fear and pride
When witnessing injustice don't find a way to hide
Open our eyes to see every lie
Because you'll never find justice till the day
That you die

How do you know when's the right time to throw in the towel
What do you say when it's all said and done
Where do you go to sort out your feelings
When nothing is like it was
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart
I couldn't keep this thing from falling a part
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
Oh no
And it doesn't mean that I won't miss you
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me
You'll always be my baby
Yeah mm
How do I look into your eyes and tell you it's over
What do I do if you break down and start to cry
Do I sell out and say the old cliche
It's not you that's me girl
What do I tell you if you ask me why
'Cause there's no easy way to break somebody's heart
I need to tell you but, I don't have the heart
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
{Doesn't mean that I don't love you}
And it doesn't mean that I won't miss you
(I won't miss you baby)
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me
You'll always be my baby
I know it's hard right now but one day you'll see that
you'll find someone who'll love you like you need to be
And it's okay if you forget about me
Wherever you are in this world you'll always be my girl
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
And it doesn't mean I don't miss you baby (baby, baby)
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
And it doesn't mean I don't miss you baby (baby, baby)
Even though we're a part save a place in your heart for me

Super highways coast to coast just easy to get anywhere
On the trans continental overload; just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel when there's no destination that's too far
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are?
Living in America, eye to eye, station to station
Living in America, hand to hand across the nation
Living in America, got to have a celebration!
I live in America
I live in America
You may not be looking for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names, like
New Orleans
Dallas
Detroit City
Pittsburgh, P.A.
New Orleans
Dallas
Detroit City
Pittsburgh, P.A.
New York City
Atlanta
Kansas City
New York City
Atlanta
Kansas City
Chicago and L.A.
Living in America, eye to eye, station to station
Living in America, hand to hand across the nation
Living in America, got to have a celebration!

La, la, la, la, la.
I only want to love you, please don't push me away,
Let me in your life.
I wasn't there when he hurt you, so why should I
Have to pay, let me in your life.
I want to share your tomorrows, so I must beg you
Today, if he's the cause of your sorrows, be glad
That he's gone away.
I need someone, let me love you, please don't push
Me away, Let me in your life.
La, la, la, la, la.

When I think of all the things you've done for me
It brings a smile to my face
And so I close my eyes to suddenly see
Memories of my sweetest days, sweetest days
But I never said thank you, I never really tried
And when I think about it I just wanna cry
There are so many things that I wanna say
I would do anything to see you
Just for a day...shoop
(just for a day)
Just for a day...shoop
(just for a day)
I never meant to hurt you
I just wanna say
I would give anything to see you
Just for a day...shoop
Just for a day...shoop
I know I love you, I tell myself
I just didn't know how to say it
But I wonder if you hear me, when I pray at night
Sometimes I forget that you're by my side
Did you know that you were the reason I live my life
Lord, I would do anything to see you
Just for a day...shoop
(just for a day)
Just for a day...shoop
(just for a day)
I just wanna know you
(wanna know you)
And all of your ways
(all your ways)
I would give anything to see you
Just for a day
Just for a day...just for a day...just for a day
Anything...anything...anything for you

I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log
I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me across your log
I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot dog!'
I've got a double-bladed axe, that really cuts good
I'm a cross cut saw, just bury me in the wood
I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log
I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot dog!'
Some call me wood-choppin' Sam
Some call me wood-cuttin' Ben
Last girl I cut the wood for, want me back again

This is the sound of a dropping bomb
After years of this are we still all content?
With being pawns in war game chess
Shuffled by King George and his English Queen
On a board of autocracy
Fundamentalist citing stories and fables
Of whose God is more righteously skilled
In whose Gods' honor [Incomprehensible] we are all killed
A dead ringer for Armageddon
([Incomprehensible])
A dead ringer for Armageddon, yeah
([Incomprehensible])
A dead ringer for Armageddon
([Incomprehensible])
This state funeral, we do not mourn
And still the wicked sleep
And dream of endless years of tyranny
Passed on by incestuous means
Skull and Bone, Freemason reigns
A dead ringer for Armageddon
([Incomprehensible])
A dead ringer for Armageddon
([Incomprehensible])
A dead ringer for Armageddon
([Incomprehensible])
This state funeral, we do not mourn
Destroy all adversary
Free yourself, erase the common enemy
Free yourself, extinguishing the quarry
Free yourself, through the smoke screen, we seek out justice

I never meant to lie to you
But I needed me an easy way out
I couldn't face the truth with you
Because I didn't want to lose my clout
I always have been good to you
Girl I promise you that nothing has changed
Momentary insanity
Must be the reason why I did you that way
So now I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
To take a chance of losing
And girl I can't take losing you
So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I want to make it up to you
No I'm never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only want to be with you
I didn't want to lie to you
But I didn't want to let you down
It never did occur to me
Sooner or later that you would find out
You know how much I care for you
And I would never want to cause you pain
I know that there is no excuse
How could I ever treat my baby that way
So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I want to make it up to you
No I'm never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only want to be with you
If you want to go
I want you to know
Girl that I understand it
But I don't recommend it
'Cause I love you more
I know you can't ignore
That I will die for you
And lay down my life for you
Girl I want to see
You standing next to me
Girl I apologize
For each and every lie
I want you to be
The only one for me
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I want to make it up to you
No I'm never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only want to be with you

Woo, the joint was a jumpin' on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac
And out stepped a cat named Pete
Diamonds on a every finger
Wore the tailor made suit
He smoked a black cigar
He wore a stetson hat, he wore a pair of cowboy boots
He busted on through the doorway
Bad as a he can be
Pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'my name is a big boy Pete'
The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
Over in a corner stood a bad man Brown
Brown smiled and grinned, he said
My friend, come three steps farther and I'll a do you in
Now, Pete, said, a look a here, buddy
Before I tan your hide
I got a forty five that keeps me alive
And seven bullets on my side
Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter, right a, out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown, cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth
Brown slipped around behind boy Pete
Cut him from his head, right on down to his feet
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
Pete took his stetson hat an beat the scene
Now, if you ever down on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
Don't mess with Brown, he'll cut you down
Take a lesson from a big boy Pete, wow

First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out.
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out.
Next they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out.
And then they came for me
This is autonomy- my american dream
Stepped over on the street - stars and stripes blinding me
Their contagious air we breath - my american dream
Classism the black plague - will mark your grave
This is the second time, we will not fall in line,
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus.
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus.
A hooded prisoner on the bay - these truths let freedom ring
A child darfur refugee - home of the free and brave
The ghosts of war who will not sleep - these truths let freedom ring
The poor who drown in bigotry - will mark your grave
This is the second time, yeah, it's the second time, we will not fall in line,
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus.
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus.
Fight forever more - the movement of the people
Fight forever more - the voice of the emigre
Fight forever more - the movement of the people
Fight forever more - no concession, no compromise
First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out.
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out.
And then they came for me
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus.
No you can't stop this exodus
No you won't stop this exodus.
This is the second time; we will not fall in line!

Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain
To me you were my pride and joy
But to you, I was merely a toy
A plaything, that you could toss around at will
Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along
Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill
Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Well, it was just for a thrill
And baby you, you, made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill

I lift my eyes up
To the mountains
Where does my help come from
My help comes from you
Maker of heaven
Creator of the earth
Oh, how I need you Lord
You are my only hope
You're my only prayer
So I will wait for you
To come and rescue me
Come and give me life

I don't know much about ART but I can tell you this
Duchamps's Urinal is a piece of piss
Van Gogh cut off his ear to spite his face (So What)
Me, I've got a message for the whole human race
I want to be a phallic symbol like the Tower of Pisa
And wipe the smile off smile off the face of that bitch, the Mona Lisa
I'll date Botticelli's Venus, just to tease her
But unless you're hung like a Jackson Pollock
You couldn't please her!
Funk you and funk your mother
Funk your sister, funk your auntie
And funk your little brother
When you've learnt how to funk one another
Don't leave that groovy thing on the shelf
Go home to the one you love and
Funk yourself
As Gallileo said, "And yet it moves"
While Oppenheimer splits the atom
And Newton finds the groove
But me, I agree with Einstein
Who put it so much simpler
I want it to end as it began
With one BIG BANG, not a whimper!
Funk you, funk quantum physics
When you've proved their theory's wrong
You can go and funk the cynics
Take a proton pill as you butt-funk the critics
You're E=MC squared (That's your life)
Well funk your buddy and
Funk your wife
Sexual psychology fasinates me more than art or science
I've attempted intercourse with every household appliance
A girl came to my clinic, I guess you'd call her a client
She wouldn'y shake my hand which I found so defiant
I said, "My Psychoanalyst is gonna love you
'Cause you look just like my sister"
She said "But I've got no arms
And armless girls cannot play twister"
She tried to take my pants off with her teeth
But her stiff upper lip got caught in the metal zip
Funk you and funk your mother
Funk your sister, funk your auntie
And funk your little brother
When you've learnt how to funk one another
Don't leave that groovy thing on the shelf
Go home to the one you love and
Home to the one you love and
Home to the one you love and
Funk yourself

In came the being-born police
To take the newly-undeceased
I was the softened gaze upon a child of God
And the sky was full of teeth
Anticipating that sweet release
I was the little engine that could
I was a courtroom bomb-sniffing dog
And the blood collector collected blood
And the cannibals all sang
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lay)
They found a weird calling card
In a puddle of body parts
Inside a bowl of angel hearts
That the children were eating
I was a vampire-hunter
I was a pregnant mother
I was a tear shed for the ones that die believing
And the blood collector collected blood
And the cannibals all sang
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lay)
Thunder dome, broken home, everybody dies alone
I wanna give a shout out to the innocent bystanding
And at the corner of my eye coming out from the teeth filled sky
With eyes as red as a dogs asshole when you see it shitting
I saw the children of God
As the walked all slovenly by
And the USB ports in their arms are bleeding
And the blood collector collected blood
And the cannibals all sang
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can!
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lay)

Hush now child, and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you, by and by
Move on up, toward your destination
You may find from time to time
Complication
Bight your lip, and take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
So move on up for peace will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind
So hush now child, and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you, by and by
Move on up, and keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushing
Take nothing less, than the second best
Do not obey, you must keep your say
You can past the test
Just move on up, to a greater day
With just a little faith
If you put your mind to it you can surely do it

I don't want your fucking dogma,
I don't believe in what you preach,
I don't want your fucking bullshit,
You infect everyone you teach.
You offer prepacked salvation,
For the guilty chosen few,
You say we're all just sinners,
Say it to the altar boy you screw.
You make me sick with what you do.
Lies and guilt and hate, are what you spew.
You do it over and over and over again.
Take your god and shove it up your ass!
Ignoring real problems,
That you've hidden in denial,
Living in the past,
Ruining people's lives.
You talk about family values,
Well, I'll tell you that's a joke.
You talk about family values,
While on some young boy's cock you choke.
You make me sick with what you do.
Lies and guilt and hate, are what you spew.
You do it over and over and over again.
Take your god and shove it up your ass!
Treating women like they're servants,
Like they're baby factories.
Treating gays like some sickness,
You're so fucking diseased!
You say I can't beat off or screw,
Or else I'm going to hell,
I'll beat off right in your fucking face,
You think I fucking care?
You make me sick with what you do.
Lies and guilt and hate, are what you spew.
You do it over and over and over again.
Take your god and shove it up your ass!

Well I'm love struck baby I must confess
Life without you darlin' is a solid mess
Thinkin' 'bout you baby give me such a thrill
I gotta have you baby can't get my fill
I love ya baby an' I know just what to do

You got me love struck baby
And I know just what to do

Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
I contemplate, as we lay
Caught up in your web of pleasure
Let me get my thoughts together
Concentrate, stimulate
Ecstacy cannot be measured
I finally found my treasure
[Chorus]
When I think about the love we make
I can't find the word to say, your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
When I think about the the love we make
I run out of breath and I start to shake
your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
Take the sun
Take the moon
All I ever need is you
You make my dreams come true
Through the storm, nice and warm
Girl you know just what to do
You know just what to do
I'm just an ordinary man
I don't understand
Why the way that I feel gets so hard for me
To explain
Am I dreamin'?
[Chorus]
And my heart is beating, sore from being
Loved so beyond my needs
All I know is I want the world to know
Your love is oh
Your love is oh
Your love is, oh

[Chorus: Donnie]
Come through baby (come over here)
Come be the life of the party
What's new in the zoo with you?
I'm chilling out, offroad safari
I'm about to bounce like a 5 count
Fiends all in a circle and I eye out
They want more, but I'm out
Tryna get more but [?]
So come through, tell me what you do
Call a friend make it two
I want more than a few
But right now you're the one I pursue
And I can tell I'm the one you're into (I can tell)
So come through
Woo
[Verse 1 : Donnie]
Like whats up with ya'?
Fix up and take in the moment
Stop acting like I'm stuck with ya'
Bitch i can leave any morning
Hit the court, ball like I'm Jordan
Know me some good girls that be whoring
Know me some bad bitches that be snorting
Girls that are not into money just be boring
Pass me my cup i keep pouring
Need me some bad chicks that be foreign
Need me some fast cars no Jeff Gordon
Brought me a video camera and we recording
I wanna see you naked that's forsuring
I wanna see you naked that's forsuring
How many times i gotta tell you're mine
I know you love a nigga grind
[Hook: Daniel Caesar]
So come through
So won't you come through?
Won't you come through? (x2)
[Chorus: Donnie]
Come through baby (come over here)
Come be the life of the party
What's new in the zoo with you?

Fiends all in a circle and I eye out
They want more, but I'm out
Tryna get more but [?]

[Verse 2: Donnie]
So come through
I will let you choose, what's the motive?
So come through
I wanna get to know whats your goal is
I will let you roll out the whole zip
Xanny pack maniac
No I can't control it
Call the plug and tell him bring me that
So come through baby
Come bring some life to the party
I got the party favor for you
I know you love your little marly
And baby you're perfect you're like a barbie
And i used to meet fiends in the lobby
I came a long way and they can't stop me
The police think I'm dirty and they watching
But I'm so up i can't spot them
If its just a few blocks I can't walk them ( ah ah ah ah)
Hoover manoeuvre I roll with a shooter
He's off the block he's far from hot (ah)
He's of the top don't have to plot (oh)
I pay the price to body drop (noo)
I push pounds like I'm Johnny Voxx
They don't allow in the club what is in my sock
[Hook: Daniel Caesar]
So come through
So won't you come through
Won't you come through (x2)
[Chorus: Donnie]
Come through baby (come over here)
Come be the life of the party
What's new in the zoo with you?
I'm chilling out, offroad safari
I'm about to bounce like a 5 count
Fiends all in a circle and I eye out
They want more, but I'm out
Tryna get more but [?]
So come through, tell me what you do
Call a friend make it two
I want more than a few
But right now you're the one I pursue
And I can tell I'm the one you're into (I can tell)
So come through
Woo

I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me
How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart
I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me
How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch may falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart
Oh my soul is dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me
How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart

You're gonna miss me little baby the day that I'm gone
You're gonna miss me little darlin the day that I'm gone
Cause I'm leavin in the mornin, won't be back at all
You have run me ragged baby, It's your own fault you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin, It's your own fault you're on your own
You didn't want me no way baby, till your other man was gone
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms
But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms
[guitar solo x3]
You have run me ragged baby, It's your own fault you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin, It's your own fault you're on your own
You didn't want me no way baby, till your other man was gone

Life can be hard if you live in vain
Trials can't be hard if you depend on God
I will not worry, I won't be afraid of hope
I'll look to Jesus who says, 'I'm the Way'
Come and go with me to my Father's house
Let's go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away
It's nothing but peace
When you're gone away
It's nothing but joy
When you are gone away
Let me tell you
You'd better go this way, if your woman see the day
Let her go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away
Hey, hey, [Incomprehensible]
And I won't be there, I'm going away
I don't know about you
I find you're nothing but joy, I'm going away
We'll pack my bags up
With the soul that I've had, I'm going away
Nothing but love over there
Sometime I happen to [Incomprehensible]
I'm going away
I'm still way by myself
And I say, I'm going away
I still wait by myself
As I, I'm going away
I'll tell you one thing
There's nothing but love and joy
[Incomprehensible] I'm going away
All the way
I have to love you
I'm going away, I'm going away
Jesus' coming back to take me by the hand
To lead me to the land, I'm going away

It's 3 in the morning
I can't be dreaming
I' m wide awake
Watching you sleeping
And I realize
There's no place
That I'd rather be
I reach put to touch you
My heart starts to race
At the touch of your skin
There ain't no mistake and I'm lost in your eyes
I see all that I need to see
I'm feeling new things every time that I hold you
I'm telling you things
I would never have told you
I'm feeling my feet coming off
Off the ground
I wasn't looking
But look what I found
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside
[Chorus]
If you think this is
As good as it gets
I swear you haven't seen nothing yet
I promise you I'm
Gonna love you
The rest of my life
My life
You turned a kiss when
No one could find the taste of your lips
I get so excited
I'm losing my mind
The way that
It's supposed to be
Mmm
Everything that we do
Is a thing worth repeating
I only think of you
When my heart is beating
I'm feeling my feet coming off
Off the ground
I wasn't looking
But look what I found
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside
[Chorus]
You cannot show
Through the pain
I didn't know what I wanted
Thank you for changing my life
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside
[Chorus]
It's 3 in the morning
I can't be dreaming
I' m wide awake
Watching you sleeping
And I realize
There's no place
That I'd rather be

You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
Baby they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could
I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never
I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you
Some time ago I thought
You run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby, don't you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don'cha never, never say that we're through
'Cause I ain't never
I aint never, I ain't never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you
I can't sleep at night
I can't eat a bite
'Cause I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me
Whoa, oh, oh
Yeah! Yeah!
I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man
Ain't never had a man that hurt me so bad
Never, never

If you could see me now.
The one who said that she?d rather roam
The one that said she?d rather be alone
If you could only see me now
If I could hold you now
Just for a moment I could really make you mine
Just for awhile turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain
Take any comfort that I can
Looking back and hoping for a freedom from my chains
And Lie in your loving arms again
If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain
Take any comfort that I can
Looking back and hoping for a freedom of my chains
And Lie in your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again

Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand,
I swear I feel like I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Seems like I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Like a wheel whirling, round and round,
Rolling down a hill (rolling-down-a-hill)
Spinning on the ground
Your kisses make my dizzy
In the head and I'm falling,
(falling, falling, falling)
Falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
I was a bird soaring, through the air
Flying fancy free, without a care
Until you clipped my wings
Now look at me
Oh, I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Yeah, falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Oh here I go, down and down I go
I can't help myself
Girl you thrill me so
Yeah you blew my mind
And I know, that I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Yes, I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
(seems like, seems like)
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I
We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I
I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you.

I'm a road runner honey beep beep!
I'm a road runner honey, and you can't keep up with me
I'm a road runner honey, and you can't keep up with me
Come on, let's race, baby baby, you will see

Move over honey, let me by
Move over baby, let this man by

Gonna put some dirt in your eye

but it don't look like you gonna last
Goodbye! I've got to put you down
I'll see you some day,

Outta life, (ha) but not everyone, not everyone
Want to got through the toils and strifes.
Like this particular fella, walks around
All day long singing this song
Harry Hippie, lies asleep in the shade,
Life don't bug him cause he
Thinks he's got it made.
He never worry about nothing in particular
Oh he might even sell free press on Sunset.
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But I can't help him much
When he's sleeping on the ground.
He's like a bottle in water
Harry just floats through life
Walks around all day long singing this song
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
Mary Hippie, she's Harry's lady
Panhandles money just to feed Harry's baby.
She can lie down a story so incredible
Man, you want to help her take the food
Home and put it on the table.
I'd like to help a man when he's down,
But I can't help ya Harry
If you want to sleep on the ground.
Sorry Harry, you're too much weight
To carry around.
But he still walks around all day singin' this song
Street child, street child, tell me where
Will you be goin'
When old man winter gets his horn
And starts blowin'
Will you hang around LA
Or hitch a ride on a freeway
Meet an old familiar face in a new place.
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But how can I help him
If he's somewhere outta town
Sorry Harry, think I'm gonna put you down.
Everybody help me sing this song, oh yeah,

Written by damon thomas, babyface, kevon edmonds, johnnie newt, robert newt (1999)
Performed by kevon edmonds
It's hard to conceive
Or to trust and believe
That you can find true love again
Someone who'll understand
'cause he hurt you and left you
Broke your heart in two
Now I'm here to rescue you
Make all your dreams come true
Baby come to me
Let me be your everything
I'll be the only man you need
If you just believe in me
And baby you'll never wonder why
My love will stand the test of time
And you will never have to look for love again
Looking in your eyes
I begin to fantasize
My very own angel sent for me
Just to set this poor heart free
Now I'm lonely no longer
Feeling so complete
Now I've got to make you realize
That my love will never die
Hook
Girl when you come to me
We'll hear the angels sing
Open your heart to me
We'll have the perfect love
Girl when you come to me
I will now and for always
Supply your needs
From here until eternity
Hook to fade

When you have troubles don't cry
Just remember that God is standing by
Thank you, Lord
When you have heartaches
Don't cry, no, no, no, no, no
Don't worry, don't be discouraged
Don't cry, yeah
And sometime after sing
Oh, I'll be standing by
(That's what He told me, yeah)
So, I say there's no need to cry
Thank you Lord, yeah
Oh, I'll be standing by
(I'm gonna be standing, standing by, yeah)
So you see that there's no, no need to cry, yeah, yeah
I'd like to say one more thing
When you have heartaches you wonder why, yeah, yeah
But just remember, I want you to remember He's standing by
And you don't really have to worry about it, now
When you have trouble please
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry oh, no, no, no
Don't worry, don't ever be discouraged
I want you to know you don't have to cry
And sometimes when your burdens get you down
But oh, I'll be standing by
(I'm gonna be standing by, thank you Lord, I thank you for seeing me)
So I get and no need, no need to cry
But oh, oh, I'll be standing by

I told you, baby, how I feel
One word can close this deal
Baby, be my queen of hearts
Please gimme that love you've got
A-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio
Maybe I'm just wastin' time
Can't get you off my mind
You could make me feel so good
I know you could if you only would
A-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio
I wrote you a six-page letter
I called you on the phone
But you started talkin' 'bout the weather
Kiddio, don'tcha know that's wrong?
I can't stand this playin' 'round
Help me up, don't let me down
Kiss me baby, tell me so
If you love me, let me know
A-won'tcha say yes? don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio
I wrote you a six-page letter
I even called you on the phone
But you started talkin' 'bout the weather
Kiddio, don'tcha know that's wrong?
I can't stand this playin' 'round
Help me up, don't let me down
A-kiss me baby, tell me so
If you love me, let me know
a-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, kiddio
Make me feel so-uh-oh oh good, so, so good, kiddio

You don't have to move, you don't have to speak
Lips follow biting.
You're staring me down, a glance makes me weak
Eyes follow striking
Now I'm twisting up when I'm twisted with you
Brush so lightly
And time trickles down, and I'm breathing for two
Squeeze so tightly.
I'll be fine, you'll be fine.
This moment seems so long
Don't waste new, precious time
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you
She sinks in my mind as she sheds through her skin
Touch like taste like fire
Hands to know what I no longer defend
Hands to fuel desire
I'll be fine, you'll be fine
This moment seems so long
Don't waste new, precious time
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you
Ooo, ah
Ooo, ah
Ooo, ah
Ooo, ah [Repeat: x 2]
And I'll be fine, you'll be fine
Is this fine? I'm not fine
Give me pieces, give me things to stay awake (stay awake)
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you

Your subtleties
They strangle me
I can't explain myself at all
And all that wants
And all that needs
All I don't want to need at all
[Bridge]
The walls start breathing
My mind's un-weaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
A falling star
Least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
Your finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
Just a little insight will make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight
It ends tonight
Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside
Now you're the first to know
[Chorus x 2]

Go to football, throw a brick,
Get no mercy, months in nick
Riot in the ghetto, red alert,
Guilty free, innocent hurt
We've been warned of rivers of blood
See the trickle before the flood
Pretend nothing happened, make no fuss
One law for them, One for us
One law for them, One law for them,
One law for them, and another law for us
No fun, no homes, no job, no use
What else is used as an excuse
Families fighting, familes looting
Next theres death, then theres shooting
One law for them, One law for them,
One law for them, and another law for us
Riots in London, blame Old Bill
We've been lucky no ones killed
Violence on the streets, more to follow
Freedom for those freedom fighters
One law for them, One law for them,
One law for them, and another law for us

My sister's name is Puudin' Tame,
They asked if she would stay the same,
My brother's name is Little Jack Horner
My mama asked to watch to heat warm them.
Sister told papa when he got home,
Papa, papa, he sassed and moaned,
Papa looked at brother, far in his eyes,
Brother started on the hand jive.
He called sister, and he called mom,
Said, "Look here, look here, what's this going on?"
Everybody had a real surprise,
But brother had tears in his eyes.
Brother's so scared he couldn't walk,
Papa's afraid he could not talk.

I saw you with that girl last night
The both of you were making eyes
You did it right in front of my face
As if I had no pride
And now you're always working late
You never have much time for me
And you're expecting me to believe
That you're not out with she
Tonight I give you my surprise
I hope that you won't mind
I'm giving you an eye for an eye
Baby I've found another
And he is my lover
And I'm going out for the rest of your life
I betcha never thought I'd go that far
I betcha never thought I'd break your heart
I betcha never even thought at all
I betcha never, no you never
I know that everybody lies, that I know I can't deny
But what if they're intentional
The intention of your crimes
Cause I know how much that I can take
I know my heart demands a change
If I can't have my way, then all I have to say
Tonight, I give you my surprise
In return for all the lies
I'm giving you and eye for an eye
Baby I've found another
And he is my lover
And we're going away for the rest of your life

Anytime I'm alone, I'm reliving the moment
Does it enter your mind?
Have I already blown it?
Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on
It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
When you're so hard to read
I wonder what you're hiding
Lying under the leaves
I'm not someone you confide in
Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on
It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Afterthought, afterthought
Get this, get this sound
Set this, set this down

It's in the way you say my name
Though I hear your voice, it's not the same
And in your eyes, I can't help but see a much different light
Than there used to be
You say hello and I want to die
'Cause deep down I know that it means goodbye
I can't let go, I just keep hanging on
Though you're standing there, you're as good as gone
Though you're standing there, you're good as gone
Are you falling out of love?
Baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love?
Your funny smile was all it took
And you said it all with just a look
Now I sit here and you sit there
We just talk and talk but we get nowhere
All we do is talk and get nowhere
Are you falling out of love?
Oh baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love?
Are you falling out of love?
Oh baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of
Are you falling out of love?
Falling out of love

Hey ho, hey ho [Repeats]
Oh, oh, gidyup
All of these flowers
For this friend of ours, it's such a shame
All of these people
All of them equally feel the same
There's silence and weeping
Looks like he's sleeping, the children say
They say he was ready, I hope he was ready
Is the prayer I'm praying
When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
Angels won't leave me behind
[Chorus]
I'm gonna be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes
(When the chariot, when the chariot comes)
I'm gonna be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes
(Giddyup)
Over the prairie
The pallbearers carry and lay him to rest
Satan's a cheater, Christ is the teacher
And life's the test
Oh Lord, take me higher
Never liked fire, I can't stay here
I gotta get ready, gotta get ready
Time has drawn near
When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
The angels won't leave me behind
[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul you keep
If I die before I wake
I pray my soul you'll take
'Cause I gotta be, gotta be ready, when Jesus comes
When that chariot comes
Got to be , got to be ready, when the chariot comes
[Repeats]
Said I've got to be, got to be ready
When the chariot comes

Here we go round and round and round
And back and forth you know
Everybody goes through it sometime
And that's just the way it flows
So we go up and down and up
And in and out the door
Even thought you know you've been through it before
For every argument that we've experienced
It's nice to know that you've remained composed
And I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This for the cool in you
Cool in you, cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you, cool, cool, cool, cool
This for you cool in you
Cool in you, cool in
This for the chill in you
Cool in you, cool, cool, cool, cool
Looking on back at all the changes
That I put you through
Any other girl in your position
Sho-nuff would've been through
Thinkin' about how you made it easy
Always there for me
Never once did you turn your back and leave
For every tear you've cried, I've cried a thousand times
Never once did I want you to hurt inside
I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This is for the cool in you
HOOK
For every tear you've cried, I've cried a thousand times
Never once did I want you to hurt inside
I want to thank you for the chill in you
Especially for you being so cool
This is for the cool in you
HOOK (repeat to fade)

Janis came, took your clothes
Took your clothes
Janis came, took your clothes
No one knows
Where she went to, where she went to
Last time we heard that she went to
In the time that it took to call you
In the time that it took to call you
Which was seconds merely seconds
Last time we heard she was crying, crying
We feel for you deeply concerned
If you need us, we'll be helpful
Hopefully

Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more
I said, "Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more
Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more"
Get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around
Won't you get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around
Get out my life heartaches, nothing but heartaches by the pound
Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top
I said, "Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder woman, ladder's nothing to make you stop"
Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on
I said, "Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on
Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on"

A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine
Jumpin' slick was my ruin
'Cause I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, aww, yeah
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, huh huh
I took this man's love and put it on a shelf
And, like a fool, I thought I had him all to myself
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, huh huh
Yeah, that's what I did
I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, aw, yeah
The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
She'll give him plenty lovin', twenty four hours a day
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman, 'cause she's tough
I mean, she really cleans up

Goin' to Detroit, Michigan
Girl, I can't take you
Hey, I'm goin' to Detroit, Michigan
Girl, you got to stay here behind
Goin' to get me a job
On the Cadillac assembly line
I'm tired of whoopin' and hollerin'
Up and down the Mississippi road
Hey, I'm tired of whoopin' and hollerin'
Pickin' that nasty cotton
Gonna catch me a bus up North
I won't have to keep sayin' yes, sir, boss
Goin' to Detroit, Michigan
Girl, I can't take you
Hey, I'm goin' to Detroit, Michigan
Girl, you got to stay here behind
Goin' to get me a job

And keep your blue jeans zipped up tight
When I make my first check
I'll put you on the Delta jet, hey hey
I'm gonna send for you, darlin'
Won't you come on home

Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey
Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her
A rose
She wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power
Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you and sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power
See a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow
Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
Cause without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power
See a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more
Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my life, heartaches
Nothin' but heartaches by the pound
Get off my ladder, woman
I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman
There is nothin that can make me stop
Get out the way, woman
I got to be movin' on
Get out the way, woman
I got to be movin' on
Get out the way, woman
I got to be movin' on

Hey big fella
I see you're outta jail
You got a brand new hat
You're walking big
You're walking tall
With your brand new baseball bat
You've got your beeper
You've got your gun
And a whole bunch of cool tattoos
Start fights at the pits at all the shows
So everybody will look at you
You're ignorant
It's knowledge you lack
You gotta fight everything you can
A big puffy head,
You're the Marshmallow Man
"Straight outta Compton"
Is your battle cry
But you're from a suburban track
Didn't your mom and daddy teach you
That ghetto stuff is really whack?
What happened to the little puffy-headed boy
We all once knew?
Marshmallow man you better watch yourself
Before someone steps on you
Check yourself before
You wreck yourself
A little man with a gun in his hand
You're such a fool
Big marshmallow man

You pretty thing
Let me buy you a wedding ring
Let me hear the choir sing
Oh, you pretty thing
You pretty thing
Let me walk you down the aisle
Darling, wear a lovely smile
Oh, you pretty thing
Let me kiss you gentle
Squeeze and hold you tight
Let me give all my love
The rest of my life
You pretty thing
Let me hold you by my side
And become my blushing bride
You pretty thing
Pretty thing
Let me dedicate my life
You will always be my wife
Oh, you pretty thing

Probably one of the nicest affections in the world
Is that feeling that's there between
A worldly old uncle and very innocent young niece
Liza, won't you lay your head on my shoulder?
Cry if you want to, I don't mind
Seems as if you need some love and kindness
And all I've got is time
Wiser is the way when you grow older
Nothing heals a broken heart but time
I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mine
Wiser is the way when you grow older
Nothing heals a broken heart but time
I know what it means to need a shoulder
So lay your head on mine

Might be that we have, different views sometimes
But that's allright, you're still a friend of mine
Sometimes you go your way
Sometimes I go mine, but that's allright
You're still a friend of mine.
Might not like your lady, you might not like mine,
But that's allright,
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You changed my cloudy days to sunshine
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine
You make clear waters out of muddy
I'm so thankful that you're my buddy
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a freind of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine

I've got a lover way over there on the mountain side
And I know that's where I should be
Don't you know
I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, she's calling my name
So sweet so plain I can hear her saying
(Come to me, baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
They tell me that the river's too deep
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I hear her saying,
(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
I'm gonna get to you
No matter what I have to do

Hmm, nobody knows
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
I said nobody knows the way I feel this morning
Mmm-mmm
Well, if I only had my way
Let me tell you that the graveyard would be the place where my man would lay
Nobody, nobody knows the way I feel this morning
Well, I pawned everything
Pawned everything I had this morning, everything, everything
Said that I pawned everything
Everything I had this morning, hmm, yes I did
I pawned my ring, my gold watch and chain
Lemme tell you I'm not proud of myself
I got just a, just a little bit of shame
Nobody knows, nobody knows the way I feel this morning
Well, I feel like screaming
Screaming and crying this morning
Yeah, this morning
Said that I, oh, feel like I could scream and cry, oh yes I do
Scream and cry this morning
Real early this morning
I feel like I could scream and cry
Don't you know I'm just a little too cold-hearted, I'd, I'd rather lay right down here and die
Nobody, nobody knows, nobody understands how I really, really feel this morning
Oh, early this morning
And I'm, and I'm, and I'm leaving here
Leaving, leaving here on a southbound train this morning, oh yes I am
Early this morning
Said that I'm oh, oh, yeah I'm leaving here, yeah, yeah
Leaving here on a Southbound train this morning, oh yes I am
I'm going all the way south
Well, I'm leaving here
Leaving here on a Southbound train
And let me tell you that nothing is ever going to bring your sweet, sweet baby back again
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows the way I feel this morning, morning

I am the Baker
I bake the cake
Make no mistake, I like to bake
Once I discover
My innate behavior
To mix, to make, to bake!
Up in the morning
To start my work
I cannot help wanting to bake a dessert
Like a gladiator
About to meet his fate
I enter my arena, bow my head and start to bake!
You want a cookie?!?
Or Baked Alaska,
Truly, the opus of bakers everywhere.
Flour, Sugar, Milk,
I send out for more
An unsung hero I need no reward
A short vacation I'd like to take
After I bake a chocolate cake
Sometimes It's mighty lonely
When you're all alone
(With a loaf of bread)
But I'm just doing my job
The best that I can
So the children can be fed
(B!)
I am the Baker
(A!)
I bake the cake
(K!)
Make no mistake, I like to bake
(ER!)
Once I discover
(BAKER!)
My innate behavior
(BAKER!)
To mix, to make, to bake!
(BAKER!)
(B!)
I am the Baker
(A!)
I bake the cake
(K!)
You're the decorator and you decorate
(ER!)
You take the credit
(BAKER!)
While I slave away
(BAKER!)
I mixed, I made, I baked!

Je Deteste, La Guerre (4x)
Bienvenue La Mort (4x)
Je n'aime pas ma vie (2x)
Je Deteste, La Guerre (2x)
Il est mort de nous (2x)
Bienvenue La Mort (2x)
Je Deteste, La Guerre (3x)
Je Deteste La Mort (1)
That's enough!
And to the death of us
To the death of us
Is this all there is?
Is this all we get
And the rest of us
Is this all there is

It's hard to tell you how I feel, exactly what do I say,
These feelings from within for now, they just get in my way,
It seems that lately for some reason, we've been torn apart,
A bond so strong at one point, has it been blown away,
[Chorus]
I'm gonna say this now and I won't hold back,
Have our hearts grown apart, do we still have a chance?
Do we still have those hopes and dreams?
And then I feel like giving in, forgetting what's been said,
Pretend like things are just the way, they were when we were young,
To share emotions we have shared, in friendship, brotherhood

Girl you broke the record
For breaking hearts
I'm sick of all the lying
When I lie alone at night
Gimme me back
Gimme back those nights
When I thought you were only mine
Whose lips were lucky that night?
Where did you go?
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
I'm not surprised that most your friends are guys
Because you use them left and right
Yeah
You used me left and right
I can't believe I bought it
This is never what I wanted
Gimme back
Gimme back those nights
When I thought you were only mine
Whose lips were lucky that night?
Where did you go?
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
Where did you go?
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
(Where did you go?)
Where did you go?
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
And wrecked your stuff
You should have thought twice when you fucked this up
Where did you go?
When you broke my heart
I broke into your apartment
To get my shit
And wreck the place for the hell of it
Yeah!

I'd like to tell you what's on her mind her deceitful ways and all her lies, but I don't know what she's gonna do next when you turn your head.
What turned you onto her last night? was it the look that she gave you? or something that she said was it me? where did she go?
She's looking at you, she's looking at me What did she say?
Not much I wanted to hear not much she needed to say
What turned you onto her last night? Was it the look that she gave you? Or something that she said, now she turns her head in shame and she is the one to blame I don't think she could waste my time she's looking at you she's looking at me what did she say? where did she go?

verse1: Am I hopeless or romantic, I've spent these past years in love with you.
I wake up tired 'cause I had the best dream of you and me in love.
pre-chorus: But then I wake up alone.
chorus: Under this October sky I'm trying to act like I'm not cold so we can talk out here for awhile.
This harvest moon shines on your lips and it draws me in to go for a kiss,
I hope you don't pull away or I'll pull you in.
verse 2: I can't believe I got the nerve to tell you, how much you really mean to me.
My head always kept me from saying how I felt but my heart said we were meant to be.
pre-chorus: Tonight is the night that I'll let you know
chorus: 1x
Bridge: instrumental
chorus: 1x
outro: I hope you don't pull away or my heart will break.

I came from drop tops and old school Chevy's
Dope boys rollin' through, shittin' on ya heavy
Fifteens in the trunk beatin' down your block
Only 4 years old when Biggie got shot
I remember playing on the block, hanging on the block
Young niggas slanging on the block, getting off them rocks
Now we livin' better now, Coogi sweater now
Weather still getting colder, we could change the weather now
But I
Came up in criminal days
Living these criminal ways what can I say
Hugging the block every day
Grindin' and making a way and then I pray
For better days that it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
Everyday ain't good but everyday ain't bad
Mama always said show thanks for what you have
Boy never forget to realize you're blessed
This cold world can rot you if you let it
Now I'm out here tryna get it, really out here tryna get it
Always knew that I would make it, maybe it was so prophetic
'Cause I came from the bottom and the humbleness beginnings
From the youngest nigga grindin' to the youngest nigga wining
Came up in criminal days
Living these criminal ways what can I say
Hugging the block every day
Grindin' and making a way and then I pray
For better days that it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
Before you die you make your mark and reach new levels
Want the bread, want the diamonds and the bezels
And if these bitches that you want, have several
Just gotta know, lotta shit's temporary
It won't last, no, no, it won't last, no
Meaning it til' here
Next thing you know it's all gone
That's why I been on my grizzy outchea
Long as I grind, better days are near
Came up in criminal days
Living these criminal ways what can I say
Hugging the block every day
Grindin' and making a way and then I pray
For better days that it don't be the same tomorrow
Now I celebrate my sorrows with this bottle
And say
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I pray for more better days
(Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey, Hip-Hop, hey)
I know that I can feel change

I couldn't sleep, baby, a wink last night
For me and my conscience are having a fight
I really treated you bad
Best thing that I've ever had
Best thing that I've ever had
Let me tell ya now
I couldn't eat, honey, a thing today
I'm so sorry, but what can I say
I really treated you bad
Best thing that I've ever had
Best thing that I've ever had
I should have known from the start
I should have treated you right, but now I hurt
The only girl I ever loved
But baby, give me a break and tell me
Tell me there's something that I can do
Anything babe, I don't want to lose you
I really treated you bad
Best thing that I've ever had
Best thing that I've ever had
Best thing that I've ever had

He said, "Come along, that urge has come again and now I'm feeling strong",
Expectations of you, don't care is you want to want along,
Love for those who make it without knowing how another feels,
The fact is, what you do is rape, it never crossed your mind before,
[Chorus]
An opinion of feelings
It's just pride, no real depth,
Opinion of feelings,
Do those feelings mean anything at all
He's pulled you down, he's taking aim, you wonder what he's waiting for,
And he may get his way this time, but will he ever change your mind,
A sharp resentment, guilt, deep pain, all this in the act of love,
And now you're just a victim of his gain, a selfish game

1, 2, 3, 4
Smoke stacks reach the sky
As talk of revolution heats the air
On every city street, in every state
The truth stands all too clear
1, 2, 3, 4
The kids are sick and tired of the news today
Sick and tired of all the lies
We want the truth
It isn't gonna be no paradise
It isn't gonna be no paradise
Forget the claims
It isn't gonna be no paradise, oh no
We need to take the world back now
We need to take control right now
Promises of a better tomorrow
Promises bought on borrowed dollars
No disaster ever looked so great
So while I say
As old men delivered that league of terror, war
We ask ourselves what are we dying for?
And so the kids are sick and tired of the news today
Sick and tired of all your lies
We want the truth
It isn't gonna be no paradise
It isn't gonna be no paradise
Forget the claims
It isn't gonna be no paradise, oh no
We need to take the world back now
We need to take control right now
The richest of the rich, dine in fancy chic cafs
Not a worry of their days
The cost of luxury, throughout empires of history
His vengeance from those empire enslaved
You better hear us now
It isn't gonna be no paradise
It isn't gonna be no paradise
Forget the claims
It isn't gonna be no paradise
It isn't gonna be no paradise, oh no

Drugs make you a man
They help you understand
It's a cheap escape and it's nothin' great
But you do them when you can
Drugs make you turn on me!
Drugs will not set you free!
Your money buys you dope
Say you just can't cope
But friends are cheap, when drugs can keep
A buzz inside your head

Oh Mary Mack
All dressed in black
With silver buttons
All down her back
Say you found another lover
Instead of me
Tell ya what I'm gonna do
I'm gon' set you free
Girl
When you leave my sight
When you go
It's no mystery
I'm not blind
To your whereabouts
And it's time
You came clean with me
In your heart
You belong to me
But it's clear
Where you'd rather be
And though it hurts
And it could break my heart
Baby I want to know
When it concerns me
All I want to know
Is when he kissed your lips
Did it feel the same as me
And if it does
Then I will let you go
I will bow out gracefully
Oh Mary Mack
Oh Mary Mack
Babe
If your love is real
Then you
Would not lie to me
Ooh girl
And if you love me still
Then explain
Explain this hotel key
It's kinda sad
After all I've done
That you
Would turn your back on me
Was it love
Or did he twist your arm
To make you turn away
Turn away from me
All I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know
Oh Mary Mack
All dressed in black
With silver buttons
All down her back
Say you found another lover
Instead of me
Tell ya what I'm gonna do
I'm gon' set you free
All I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
To tell my troubles to
Don't be afraid
You heard what I said
Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best
Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
To tell my troubles to
Don't be afraid

Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best

Baby, when I found out you were lyin'
Playin' around and connivin'
Undesired tears I was cryin'
`Cause sugar coated lies I was buyin'
I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Goin' wherever you take me
Don't know why I put up with the pain
`Cause nobody else could make me
You got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned] Hey, hey [Out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned] Hey, hey [Out of my mind]
When you led me to the water I drank it
Man, I drank more than I could hold
When you took my mind and body
You know you want to take my soul
Where can I run
Where can I hide
Who can I talk to
Tell me what, what can I do
When you got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned] Hey, hey [Out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned] Hey, hey [Out of my mind]
Hee...you got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned] Hey, hey [Out of my mind]
Been around with every guy in town [Stoned out of my mind]
Funny but I just can't put you down [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]
You got me goin' [Stoned out of my mind]

One billion workers stand up from their chairs
Their faces no longer struck with their fears
Attack, attack, stabbed in the back
Disgraced, disgraced, traitors trade face to face
Revolution, the engine of history
When all the lights go out, when all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows, when all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn I won't be alone
Punching the clock, stabbing the boss
We don't need the CEO's they need us
Attack, attack, outsourced for a hack
Disgraced, disgraced, displace and replace
Proletarians of the world unite
You have nothing to lose but your chains
When all the lights go out, when all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows, when all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn I won't be alone
We are not numbers, we are names
We won't be alone
We are not crime reports, we are history
We won't be alone
We are not folklore, we are culture
We won't be alone
We are not human resources, we are human beings
I won't be a, I won't be a, we won't be alone
When all the lights go out
When all the lights go out
When all the lights go out, when all the world is in doubt
When all the goods cease to move I won't be alone
When all the swords become plows, when all the fields are afoul
When all the cogs cease to turn I won't be a, I won't be a
We won't be alone

After all these years, I can't just turn my back
All the blood, the sweat and all the tears
You've got to earn your respect
Well what the fuck do you want from me?
Cause you don't give a fuck about my scene
And I could give two fucks about you
Stop living vicariously through
You're running around like some old school star
But we don't know who you are
You dropped out - after a year
I know you're fake - you're fucking insincere
You're gone longer than you were here
Well now you're back and we don't care
We didn't build the scene for you to disgrace it
I didn't make a name for myself fo you to claim it
To you this is just another trend
But I'll be representing hardcore to the bitter end
The few, the proud, it's a way of life
Me and my friends always side by side
Cause we've got respect for each other
I treat my motherfucking friends like brothers
We didn't build the scene for you to disgrace it
I didn't make a name for myself for you to claim it

They're coming to take over
Huh!
Look out behind you and
Beware of the Ska Robot Army!
They're coming to take over
To terrorize the earth
They're skanking in their best suits, so
Beware of the Ska Robot Army!

You gotta do it yourself
Yeah I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
If I was you, and you were me
You'd wanna be winning
If you want something bad, y'all
You gotta wanna give your all
'cause I believe so much in we
And know we're not kidding
If you feel the same as me y'all
You gotta wanna take the ball
Now I found out that nothin' is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own
Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(all on our own)
If it's up to us we've got to take it home
(all on our own)
Now can't you see that all we need
To be a go-getter
Gotta make your own decisions
You gotta go for what you know
There comes a time in our lives
You wanna be bigger
Gotta keep keep on pushing
You gotta learn to take control, yeah

While all the while the slime was under the building
So they packed up their group, got a grip cam equip
Grabbed the proton packs off their backs, and they split
Found out about vigo, the master of evil

We go through changes
Time after time
I guess that's just life
Feelings we can't express
We only hide
Deep down inside
Who needs another sad affair
Girl, if we care
We'll end it right here
We could be lovers
If we'd only share
All that we feel
But we must be sincere
I know we've been
Been here so many times before
But don't you think
Think that our love's worth fighting for
If we try
Just one time, oh baby
If we try
Then I'll know we'll get by
Our love is gentle
It's give and take
It's all about the vows we make
Whether we honor them
With love and trust
It's all up to us
Who needs another sad affair
Girl, if we care
We'll end it right here
We could be lovers

To dispel any rumor
I should do this sooner than later
I had a girl and didn't hate her
But I let her go
I swear that I've got problems
And she can never stop them from ending
My head is fucked up
And I've been pretending
She's the one
How could I let it go on?
You wanna hurt someone
That's why I wrote you this song
[Chorus]
Kimberly, don't cry
I'll always be by your side
Yeah, Kimberly don't cry
A broken heart just takes time
Let's take it one step further
I never meant to hurt her so badly
We had a love and I can say madly
Let her go
I couldn't let it go on
Let her know
I put my soul in this song

Kimberly, don't cry
I'll always be by your side
Yeah, Kimberly don't cry
A broken heart just takes time

Yeah, I could shed a thousand tears
But you'd never see them falling
Yeah, I could walk a thousand years
But you'd never see me crawling
I've said it before
And I'm saying it one time more
[Chorus]
Kimberly, don't cry
I'll always be by your side
Yeah, Kimberly don't cry (don't cry)

Girl it don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you, you wait for me

These are the times we all wish for
The moment we less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not at all

Morning, noon, and suppertime
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like reese's pieces
Come on girl you know I need you

Right here, all by myself.
I ain't got no one else.
The situation is bleeding me.
There's no relief for a person like me.
Depression's got a hold of me.
Depression, i gotta break free.
Depression's got a hold on me.
Depression's gonna kill me.
I ain't got no friends to call my own.

There's no girls that want to touch me.

When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now
I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you
I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little

Talkin' 'bout the power

Here we are nowhere
Surrounded by space
Angels of legends
Have taken our place
We had deliverance
The moment passed
These lost disciples
Are leading at last
We shout a hymn
To the earth and the birds
To the lost disciples
Who don't know the words
Strange collision
Of heaven and hell
A bastard vision
We know too well
Our emotions
Are all second hand
Belong to an ocean
Misplaced in the sand
We are nowhere at last

This is blues power!
Well
Play it now)
Everybody understands the blues
Are you listening?
Yeah!
I say everybody understands the blues
Everybody from one day to another has the blues
You take the little baby that's layin' in the cradle
He can't get that milk bottle fast enough
He go to kickin' an'cryin'
An' goin' on, tearin' up the little baby bed
He got the blues
Can ya dig it?
Yeah!
Ha, ha, ha
You take this girl that's got this main squeeze
That's her boyfriend, that is, you know
An' he just bought a brand new GTO
You know she want to be wit' him everytime he cranks it up
An' go around the corner to the soda fountain
This is where she want to go an'show it off
Where all the girls and guys be
You know what I mean?
An' she get ready to go out this particular night
An' her mother say, "Daughter you was just out last night
You can't go out tonight, that's too many nights in a row"
She go in the room an'fasten the door
An' won't answer the phone, won't eat
Won't talk to nobody
She got the blues
That's what's wrong wit' her
Some people call them the reds, the pinks
When ya get through
It's the old-fashioned country blues
That's right
I haven't seen my main squeeze
In ten long weeks, today
You know I got the blues
Can you dig it? ha, ha, ha
Yeah!
Woo! Alright!
Ah but wait, I don't think you're with me

I grew up with love and affection
Know what it means to spread that infection.
No matter waht may stand in my way.
This energy within, it guides me day by day.
At times when I feel there is no way out.
I'll bitch. cry. moan. whine. scream and shout.
But what I'd like to see in the world most today.
We've got to SPREAD IT! SPREAD IT!
Now I know you must be thinking
There is something wrong.
How could I have the nerve.
To write this song.
Well. it's like I've got this feeling.
Stripped away of pride.
A crazy mixed up feeling.
That I just can't hide
Emotion is this great thing.
We've all got it. let it show.
If u can share emotion.
Then by all means let me know.
And if we wanna make a better world today.
SPREAD IT! SPREAD IT! THIS WORLD OVER! GO!

Everybody gather round and listen to my song
I've only got one
We who are young, should now take a stand
Don't run from the burdens of women and men
Continue to give, continue to live
For what you know is right
Most of your life can be out of sight
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light
Where everyone's free
At least that's the way it's supposed to be
We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on
Before we dismiss, one thing I insist
When you have your young, remember this song
And our world surroundings, its leaps and bounds
Ups and downs, is reality
Teach them to be strong, and when they are grown
They can proudly imply that we were an alright guy
For all the wrong now is right
This nation's people are now united as one
And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on, y'all
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keeping on
(Keep on, keeping on)
We got to move on up, y'all
(We got to move on up)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Some years back I remember
Still in my mind so well
My mama made this ?
And I found it never fails
Never worry too long
(Worry too long)
About what goes on
(About what goes on)
Today it's sorrow
(Today it's sorrow)
Look like joy tomorrow
(Look like joy tomorrow)
Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Keep on, keep on
(Keep on, keep on)
We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We're gonna move on up
(We're gonna move on up)
Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Move on, move now
(Move on, move now)
Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)

I remember days and nights were never cold
Had you in my life I had you there to hold
And I remember love warm as a summer day
But I lost you
And I lost my way
Now I'm in the rain
Begging you please please
Baby won't you show me the way back to your heart
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far
Lead me back to the road
That leads back to your arms
Every night another lonely street
I walk down alone
Searching for a light
Your light to lead me home
Leave a candle in the window
And let it shine for me
Take my hand and take these tears away
I can't take the pain
I'm on my knees begging you please
Chorus
Take my hand
Take me in your arms
I'm out in the dark
Down on my knees, begging you please
Chorus

Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
We meet every day at the same cafe
Six-thirty and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the juke box plays our favorite songs
Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
We gotta be extra careful
That do we don't build our hopes up too high
Because she's got her own obligations
And so, and so, do I
Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
Well, it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
Tomorrow we'll meet
The same place, the same time
Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

Mm
Here comes the mailman walking up the street
And it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
Because he he brought me, (yes he did)
I said he he brought me, (yes he did)
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong (we had a love)
It would take a lifetime to break us apart
Oh yes
But I found out today I was wrong
And my reward was a broken heart my my heart
Oh here comes the teardrops welcome a welcome to my eyes
And I couldn't hold 'em back no matter if I tried
Woo, woo oh
You know it hurt me so inside
Won't you pardon me while I cry
Because he brought me (yes he did)
I said he brought me (yes he did) a letter full of tears
(Here comes the mailman) Those aren't drip drop tears (bringing me tears)
Can't you see them falling (here comes the mailman bringing me tears)
Woo, oh woo, woo oh, woo, woo oh, oh oh, (hey, yes he did, hey hey , yes he did, hey
Hey hey woo
Yes he did)
I thought (hey hey hey woo yes he did)
We had a love so strong
(Hey hey hey woo, yes he did)

She screams when I'm away She's been gone before.
I worry all the time, why worry anymore
Now I go, away
Now I know, today
I picked out your star
Turned night to day
A simple whisper from your voice
And I fade away
You wish for love
You pushed me away
Your love for me was everything I need
The air I breathe
She, now she's all alone
Her eyes they drown in tears
Their love was meant to last
But she is blind with fear
Now I go, away
Now I know, today
Leave me be
Now I'm free
Love reflecting everything
You want space
I need you to help me see this through

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing, in exhaltation
O sing, all ye citizens
Of heav'n above
Glory to God
Glory in the Highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Oh Jesus, to Thee
Be the glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low
The curtains are down
There's no one here
(there's no one here in the crowd)
Say your lines
But do you feel them
Do you mean what you say
When there's no one around
Watching you, watching me
One lonely star
(one lonely star you don't know who you are)
I've always been in love with you
I've guess you've always known it's true
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say good-bye
Say good-bye, say good-bye
Make them laugh
It comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile
All the world loves a clown
(just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well
I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star
(one lonely star you don't know who you are)
Hook
All the world is a stage
And everyone has their part
How was I to know
Which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break, you'd break, you'd break
You'd break my heart
Hook

I walk the streets on a saturday night
the skies are dim but the neon is bright
the lights are warm but the pavement is cold
love is bought and bodies are sold
Doesn't mean a thing to me
I'm just one of so many
I don't feel a thing at all
I'm not waiting for your call
I'm not in love
and I don't want to
I'm good for nothing
'cause nothing is true
People searching about tonight
Looking for someone
No one seems right
the ? warm and bodies are cold
Love is bought and bodies are sold

Future shock
Ooh, hoo
Hey, little sister
Where's your brother
See your mother
Standing on the soup line
God bless your father
Ain't got the strength
To be bothered
The almighty world
Hear me now
Whisper on
To weigh him down
We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock
Future shock, future shock
All worldly figures
Playing on niggers
Oh, see them passing
See how they're dancing
To the superfly
Oh, ain't it wrong
When you don't know
Where we come from
Dancing in our youth
Dying at the truth
It ain't over
(Over, over, ain't over)
We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock
Future shock, future shock
The price of the beat
Higher than the dope in the street
Is it any wonder
For those with nothing to eat
We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock
Future shock, future shock

I can't believe my eyes
This nightmare that's come to life
What sparked the flames?
What lit the fires?
Can you put 'em out and save my life?
Cause I still see them at night
And I won't say I'm alright
Until you hold me
I sleep with opened eyes
Cause I'm not ready to die
I won't say that you're wrong
Cause they've been here for far too long
I"m breathing ash
I'm feeling flames
And I've been lying wide awake
Cause I still see them at night
And I won't say I'm alright
Until you hold me
The sheep are spreading lies
But I'm not ready to die
Without a face who can you trust?
It's just a reckless hit and run
Cause I still see them at night
And I won't say I'm alright
Until we end this
Violent firefight
Cause I'm not ready to die
No I'm not ready to die
Are you ready to die?

The President got caught getting head
So soon some people will be dead
Iraqi bodies scattered around
By the cluster bombs that land in their barracks and their homes
They get on TV and openly state
That Saddam Hussein should be removed from his place
If anybody said that about the U.S. President
The U.S. military would rip them a new ass
So where is the real terrorist
In the Middle East or in the U.S.?
So who is the real terrorist
Is it Saddam Hussein or your own President?

Baby, I'm feeling
Sort of lonely
I heard the news today
Somebody told me
That you were leaving
And I just you up called to say, I
I still, love you I love you baby
I know you won't believe me
When I say
For another chance, I'll make it up to you baby
Don't give me up, no
Don't throw in the towel
'Cause I just want you to know, I still
I still love you I love you, baby
I know I'm guilty
Just like you said
But baby, oh, baby don't
Don't throw our love away oh
They say love is better
Second time around
But I don't believe in taking chances
Your love is sweeter
Than any love I've found
And I just wanna call you up and say I love you, I love you, baby
I love you tomorrow, just like I did today
Oh, lord, I love you, I love you, lord, baby, I love you, oh
Ooh, you my daily throb and my midnight dream

Well there's floodin' down in Texas
All of the telephone lines are down
Well there's floodin' down in Texas
All of the telephone lines are down
And I've been tryin' to call my baby
Lord and I can't get a single sound
Well dark clouds are rollin' in
Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Well dark clouds are rollin' in
Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Yeah flood water keep a rollin'
Man it's about to drive poor me insane
Well I'm leavin' you baby
Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay
Well I'm leavin' you baby
Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay
Well back home are no floods or tornadoes
Baby and the sun shines every day

Say man
What's that boy?
I want to tell you about your girlfriend,
What about my girl?
But you don't look strong enough to take the message
I'm strong enough
I might hurt your feelings
My feelings already hurt by bein' here with you
Well, I was walking down the street with your girl the other day
Uh-huh
And the wind was blowin' real hard
Is that right?
And the wind blew her hair into my face
Uh-huh
Hee-hee, you know what else happened?
What happened?
The wind blew her hair into her face
Yeah?
And we went a little further; you want to hear the rest of it?
I might as well...
The wind blew her hair into the street!
Hey, since you told me about my girl I'm gonna tell you about yours
I was walking down the street with your girl
Yeah?
I took her home, for a drink, you know
Took her home?
Yeah, just for a drink
Oh
But that chick looked so ugly she had to sneak up on a glass to get a drink of water
Hah-hah-hah-hah, well, you've got the nerve to call somebody ugly
Why you're so ugly the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested
That's alright
My mama didn't have to put a sheet over my head so sleep could slip up on me
Hey, looky here
What's that?
Where you from?
South America
What's that?
South America
You don't look like no South American to me
I'm still from South America
What part?
South Texas
Hah-hah-hah, where your western boots at?
I've got 'em on
Them ain't no boots you got on, they're broke in

It's true you got me wrapped around your finger
It seems to me like, seems to me like that's where I belong
You know, you know how to hold me
You know how to thrill me
And you know how to control me, makin' me like it
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) just enough to keep me hangin' on
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) just enough to keep me hangin' on
My heart is like a yo-yo string
I'm tied to you, tied to you, right or wrong
My love keeps on growing
And your love keeps right on showing
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) just enough to keep me hangin' on
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) just enough to keep me hangin' on
A love as true as mine
Will make you do most anything
Like hiding tears and heartaches
And dreaming those old silly dreams
Oh sweetheart, you got me
Got me where you want me
You just keep stringing me along
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) just enough to keep me hangin' on
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) just enough to keep me hangin' on
And like a fool, I tagged along
(Just enough to keep me hangin' on) oh just give me, just enough to keep me hangin' on

Girl, I always think about it 24/7
Can't get it outta my mind
I want so bad to be with you
Baby, when I dream about it, it feels like heaven
Why you gotta be so fine
I want so bad to be in you
I'm longing girl to tell you
'bout the visions in my head
You never will be lonely
Long as roses are red
Girl, you should never worry
My intentions, they are true
The only thing that matters is you
'cause I love you
And I want you
And I can't be without
I swear there's no doubt
That I need you
I adore you
Every inch, every part
With every little bit of my heart
Baby, I can think of 'bout a million reasons
Why you gotta be with me
My lovin' flows like endlessly
Baby we can go about a zillion places
What's your fantasy
Just ask and girl, you shall receive
I want so much to tell you
Girl, you'll never hurt again
Long as london bridge keeps falling
Girl, just know I got your back
Girl, there's just no rhyme, no reason
'bout the way I feel 'bout you
The only thing that matters is you

'cause I fell in love the day, baby
You came into my life
I've never been in love before
Changing everything I think about

I told my friends all about you
How much I miss you and love to kiss you
I'm in love with you, darlin', and I hope you love me too
Woke up this morning, I was all alone
Looked for the girl I love, but she was gone
Somebody help me, help me find the girl I love
I left my baby in California
Oh, how I cried when she said goodbye
Somebody help me, help me find the girl I love

I can't get no sleep
In this noisy street
I've got to move
(I've got to move)
I've got to find me a quiet place
There's a man next door
With a radio and he plays it
All through the night
There's a couple in the
Apartment above my head
That don't do nothing
But fuss and fight
I can't get no sleep
In this noisy street
I've got to move
(I've got to move)
I've got to find me a quiet place
Tell me, where do you go
When you got no dough?
There must be a way
Out of here
But I've got to find
Some peace of mind
There must be a place
That I can find
Believe me when I tell you
There's a cat that gets
Under my window
And he meows all the time
There's a drunk that wakes me
In the middle of the night
Singing 'Sweet Adeline'
I can't get no sleep
In this noisy street
I've got to move
(I've got to move)
I've got to find me a quiet place
I can't get no sleep
In this noisy street
I've got to move
(I've got to move)
I've got to find me a quiet place
Oh, I've got to move

I've got to find me
A quiet place
I got to get away from
This noisy street

Have you seen my baby
On the avenue
You know she's drivin' me crazy
With the funny things she do
I've seen her with the milkman
Ridin' down the street
I said "please mister milkman
Send my baby home to me"
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
Hold on hold on hold on
Seen her with a gypsy
Dancin' in the woods
She's always been unfaithful to me
she ain't never been no good
I said "please don't talk to strangers baby"
But she always do
She said, "I could talk to strangers if I want
'Cause I'm a stranger too"
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on ohh, hold on
Ohh hold on hold on yeah hold on
Mmmmm hmmm...hold on...

Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
You say I been runnin' with other women
But take a look at yourself
I called your mama
'Bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama
'Bout three or four nights ago
Well, your mother said
"Son don't call my daughter no more"
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Well now, you say I been runnin' around
But you got somebody else
Come on back home, baby
Try my love one more time
Come on back home, baby
Try my love one more time
Well now you've been gone away so long
I'm about to lose my mind

So many tears since you went away
I'll always think of you, every night and day
Someday, someday, my darling, I won't be troubled no more
Trouble, trouble in its misery
Already had the best of poor me
Someday, someday, my darling, I won't be troubled no more
You heard my story, I sung my song
But you're leaving poor me; you know that's wrong
Someday, someday, my darling, I won't be troubled no more

You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone
You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong
You call my house, just yesterday
I picked up the extension and I heard every word you say
Why don't you just go, man and leave my little girl alone
Now before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong
You call my house all hours of the night
Let me tell you mister that's a sure, sure way to start a fight
Why don't you just go on man and leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man and I'm gonna do something wrong

Every time that I'm with you girl
I can't believe you share my world
But it's real
And every time that I hold you close to me
Forever's all that I can see
How it feels
See I don't give a damn what my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never felt this way before
You leave a brother want more
[Chorus]
I hate to see you go
Even though I know when you're comin' back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish you could stay
Every time you go away
From the very first time that I touched you babe
Couldn't find the words to say you set me free
And every time that I kiss your lips
Nothin' ever tasted quite like this
Or got so deep
See I don't give a damn what my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never ever felt this way before
You always leave me want more
[Chorus]
You're the sunshine of my day
You brighten up my night
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you say goodbye
[Chorus]

I choose my words like wise men do
And tonight
I'll get you right
I rule my world , like great men do
And I fight
I fight for mine
And you look so good
On the floor
Put my mind in a dirty zone
If they watch
Let them watch
Not losing you tonight
Oh oh
Im coming to get you
Oh oh oh
Im running im gunning for you
Oh oh
Im gonna get you
I know u
U want me to
I lost my mind some where
Between your face
And your perfect shape
Found a pleasure watching you
Having fun
Fooling around
Coz you look so good
On the floor
You make me wanna leave her now
If they talk
Let them talk
Not losing you tonight
Oh oh
Im coming to get you
Oh oh oh
Im running im gunning for you
Oh oh
Im gonna get you
I know u
U want me too
Girl you blow me away
I want you here with me
Girl you blow me away
I want you to stay
If you really wanna have fun tonight
Just scream
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Im coming to get you
Oh oh oh
Im running im gunning for you
Oh oh
Im gonna get you
I know u
U want me too

I could feel
It coming from a mile away
When I opened up the door
I saw everything that I've been waiting for, hey
Close your eyes
I don't care what other people say
Here underneath the stars
Now Jupiter and Mars don't seem so far away
[Chorus]
I want you to know
You take my breath away
And it's been that way right from the start
I didn't know how to tell you
That I want to love you
With every beat of my heart
(With every beat of my heart)
Take my hand
Don't be afraid, don't go
I want you to stay
Just relax your mind
I promise that tomorrow will be just like today
[Chorus: x2]

I'm an evil gal, don't you bother with me, no
I said I'm an evil gal, don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
Well I'll empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery, yes I will!
If you tell me good mornin'
I'm gon' tell you that's a lie
If you say hello baby I'mma give you the evil eye
I'mma evil gal, don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
I'm gonna empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery, yes I will
I want caviar for breakfast, champagne every night,
I want a midnight snack for every man that I invite
I'm an evil gal, don't you mess around with me, no
So goodbye baby, I'm gonna set you free
Whoa if you wanna be happy, honey don't you mess around with me, yeah
I said if you wanna be happy, don't you mess around with me, no
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery
Yeah, yeah I'm evil

Tell me he didn't break your heart
Tell me he didn't lie to you
Tell me there's no way that he set you up
Tell me there's no way that you let him use you
You'd think by now you'd know him by all his signs
So how could you be a fool
Girl, here he comes again
Telling lies to you
Girl, here he comes again
To break your heart
Find out you know he's no good
So when will you learn
He's nothing but a user
It's not my place to say what to do
But I just can't stand when love abuses you
He's never gonna change
He enjoys seeing you in so much pain
So little girl get up off your face
Hold your head up high
And tell him that you're through
Hook
Girl, I know you want me
I see the look in your eyes
All you have to do is ask me
Don't think you're wasting your time
I am yours if you want me
All you have to do is tell me
Do you want me
Do you want him
Look behind your back
He's comin' again
Hook 3 times

Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
He'd better not take the ring from me
Bo Diddley caught a nanny goat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley caught a bear cat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat
Mojo come to my house, ya black cat bone
Take my baby away from home
Ugly ask Mojo, where has he been?
Up your house, and gone again
Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard?
My pretty baby said she wasn't for it

Day after day,
Alone on a hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.
Well on the way,
Head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
or the sound he appears to make,
and he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.
And nobody seems to like him,
they can tell what he wants to do,
and he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.
Ooh, ooh,
Round and round and round.
And he never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him,
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.
Ooh,
Round and round and round

Though your dark eyes, you can feel my every sin
When I walk right into a straight line, this world of yours
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
You're the fall guy in the corner of my gloom
And it feels like everything I see is nothing new
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
There's a door there that opens without you
And the door lies with open keys to my room
Flame of the torchlight fill my thighs, fulfill
As I crave, I consume 'em but I don't give
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again

You couldn't break me in the end... (oh no)
And such a freedom I enjoy
When you're deaf to the sounds you trust
If that was all you've got, my friend... (oh no)
Then set yourself to disappoint
Yeah...
Feels like I'm strapped down on this table... so tight
You've got me stuck to a razor's edge
And I'm trapped in a deadbolt glove
You stand to cut me you're unable... oh no
And such a streak starts steading heads
And I live for the things I love
Sad, but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Remember when things seem so stable... you know that
I compromise just to appease
Yeah, you take but you take too much
If what you need's not seeming able... yeah, right
Then maybe it works when I leave
Yeah, you fake what you say you love
Sad, but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Move faster
I can't move enough
How much longer?
Is this long enough?
We can't be
And it won't even catch your attention
And it pains me so to mention
Sad, but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you
Take what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you

Give me back my wig, honey let your head go bald
Give me back my wig, honey let your head go bald
You really had no business, honey buyin' no wig at all
Give me back that wig, honey let your head go bald
Give me back that wig, honey let your head go bald
You really had no business, honey buyin' no wig at all
Give me back my wig, honey let your head go bald
Give me back that wig, honey let your head go bald
You really had no business, honey buyin' no wig at all

I've been unhappy all my life,
Seems like all I do is sacrifice.
The more I sacrifice the worse it makes me feel.
Most of the things I thought were wrong
Turned out to be for real.
I don't know if I'm ready
For the love you want to give.
I need something in my life to make me want to live.
I'm up in my whole life,
But I think need a change.
I need some sunshine in my life,
I can't stand the rain.
Tell me do, do, do I need you?
Tell me do, do, do I need you?
I don't need no man,
I already know the game.
I need more loving in my life
To chase away the pain.
You might be good to me,
And I might be good to you.
I don't need nobody that can't be true.
Tell me do, do, do I need you?
Tell me do, do, do I need you?
Tell me do, do I need your kiss?
Do I need your love?
Do I need the pain
That you might bring?
Like I said in my last song,
Can't stand the rain'
Tell me do, do I need your love?
Tell me do, do I need your kiss?
Tell me do, do I need you?
Do I need the pain you might bring?

I crashed in the jungle while tryin' to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the states
I was stranded in the jungle afraid and alone
Tryin' to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know there was a record jump my plane
Had been picked up and spotted my girl in lovers lane
And meanwhile, back in the states
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle flat as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me
Meanwhile back in the jungle
The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cookin' and I looked to see
That's when; I found out they was a cookin' me
Great Cuckoo let me outta her
Meanwhile back in the states
[Chorus]
I jumped outta the pot and finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was gettin' mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the states in bout a half a day
And when I got to lovers lane I was almost dead
When my soul was gone, here's what I said
Baby, baby, your man is no good
Baby, baby, he should've understood
You can trust me as long as can be
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Cause I love you,

Where was Jodie when the lights went out
Standing in the corner shouting, shout, sister, shout!
[Chorus:]
What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could wail away!)
What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could play!)
The girl wore a dress with no shoes on
The big tenor man really blew his horn
[Chorus]
Somebody called a cop about half past four
He really just couldn't get through that door
[Chorus]
Where was Jodie when the lights went out?

It happens once, just once
When our worlds collide
And you're forced to confront one another
Who exactly is in charge here now?
Is it the moneychangers, the wolves or is it you, my brother?
We're all SPECTRES, we are phantoms, and we are the minions
So, we get screwed, while they make the millions
Can I have another serving of dignity, sir?
I bow down before you and it is you that I serve.
Now, go with the others and do as you're told
You don't belong to this and may I be so bold
As to say "it's been a pleasure doing business with you,
"But know this, I'm the hunter, but I don't hunt for you"
I work hard for my money and I don't give it away!
Do us all a big favor and come back some other day
Or, how about never? Because you're not welcome here
So I'll go about my business and I'll see you next year.

Oh, pretty woman
Sure's the rising sun
Says all your cheap paint and powder
Ain't gonna help you none
'Cause she's a pretty woman
Right down to her bone
So you might as well
Leave your skin alone
chorus:
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh, pretty woman
What you gonna do?
You kept on foolin' around
Till I got stuck on you
So you can drop your mess
And come down off your throne
Stop using my poor heart
As just a stepping stone
chorus
Oh, pretty woman
That's all right for you
Now you just go on doing
What you wanna do
But someday when you think
That you've got it made
You're gettin' water deep enough
So you can't wade
chorus
Oh, pretty woman
Oh, pretty woman
Oh, pretty woman
Oh, pretty woman
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh, pretty woman

Checked out, I'm waiting for the weekend
Coked up, It's alright I'm leaving
But I don't ever wanna go
Skip school, I'm already failing
Told mom and dad that I'm bailing
Now we're driving up the coast
Cracked out and sleepless in Seattle
Got drunk and barfed on my shadow
I don't ever wanna go
Got high and ended up in Portland
But you can't find liquor in Oregon
So we'll just talk and bum some smokes
Woke up, you caught me with a smile
Passed out on your bathroom tile
And I think that this is soap
So sad, I should've told her something
Call her up and talk about nothing
But I forgot I lost my phone
And all my friends, they just stay the same
I'm growing up but nothing's changing
I'm so sick of this stupid place
It's so suburban and so boring
I should try and get a life
But I don't want that 9 to 5
I'd rather die, keep getting high
So pack my things and say goodbye
Checked out, I'm waiting for the weekend
Checked out, I'm waiting for the weekend
Checked out, I'm waiting for the weekend
Checked out, I'm waiting for the weekend

We're going from Tahiti to France to Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley Coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white
I'm wearing triple black, a Gear's top flight
Trips to Venice the man a steel when a menace
A match made in heaven when we blend this
Lovers everlasting in other words endless
To love any other man would be senseless in yor face
On the real was the honey looking laced?
[Chorus]
Ladies and gentlemen, Howard Hewitt

Nothing we have to lie about
Hope lovin' you don't confuse you
Ooh baby baby, I don't wanna lose you
And when we touch our hearts move at a steady pace

The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door

When can my heart beat again
When does the pain ever end
When do the tears stop from running over
When does you'll get over it begin
I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you
When can I see you again
When can my heart beat again
When can I see you again
And when can I breathe once again
And when can I see you again
When does my someday begin
When I'll find someone again
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you
[HOOK]
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you
[HOOK 2 times]

You take whatever we give you
We are indebted to you
More money, more fish to skin
Just keep on reading that shit we spew.
We gather at Oleander
You shower us with your love
More wine, more drugs than you can imagine
Don't thank me, it's all for fun.
This is our sanctuary
You're making our dreams come true
Your lives are ordinary
We take whatever we want from you
This is just life's illusion
You'd better get used to it
Less money, more bills to pay for
It's something that I won't do.

There's a troubled man, confused within
Stumbling in darkness because of sin
Slipping and tripping with somebody else's love
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
There's a sad heart all wrecked with pain
Look at the sad face, filled with shame
Walking on troubled ground where I don't belong
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
You know it's wrong, this way of living
Sometimes you have to take less than what you're giving
But right now I'm satisfied taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
Traveling the wrong way on a one way street
Walking the wrong way on a one way street
Slipping and tripping with somebody else's love
Taking bitter with the sweet
Traveling the wrong, wrong, wrong
Wrong, wrong way on a one way street

Who will buy a glad story

Come into my house of glory
And I will treat you well
Who will buy a sad story
That a widow has to tell?
Come into my house of lonely
And I will treat you well
Young and old, we all have stories
That we all must try to sell
Tales of how you get to heaven
And how we been through hell
Who will buy a perfumed story
That a young girl has to tell?
Sleep with me on satin pillows
And I will treat you well

I can't sleep at night
I can not prove a thing
I can't hold on much longer, baby
Living this a-way
You know I'm crazy about you baby
And I wonder do you ever think of me?
M-hm
You know I'm wild about you baby
But you don't care a nothin' in this world for me
Oh no
It ain't but a-one thing, baby
To make your baby drink
When I hear you say you don't love me
And then I began to think
'Cause I'm so wild about you, baby
And I wonder do you ever think of me?
Mm-hm, now
You know I'm wild about you, baby
But you don't care a-nothin' in this world for me, now
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Oh, I go crazy about you, baby
And I wonder do you ever think of me?
Mm-hm, now
You know I'm just wild about you, baby
But you don't care a nothin' in this world for me
I'm so wild about you, baby
Can't sleep at night...

It's a new day
It's a bright day
Even when you stand in the dark
It's just that
You've been broken into fifty pieces
Today is gone
I'm the only light that you see
You need someone
I know all you needed was me
Everyday we awake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
Another pale moon
Shines like high noon
Midnight never felt so cold alone
It's just that you're uneasy
When you need me
Today is gone
I'm the only light that you see
You need someone
I know all you needed was me
Everyday we awake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can say it's right, but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
Today is gone
I'm the only light that you see
You need someone
I know all you needed was me
Everyday we awake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can think it's right, but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
Everyday we wake if it takes too long
Just tell me something new
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can think it's right, but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone
You can think it's right, but it feels so wrong
Just show me something true
Forget about the sunshine
Forget about the sunshine when it's gone

It's been so long since I touched your face
It's been so long since I had the taste
It's been so long since I had you here with me
It's been so long since I yesterdays
It's been so long since you get away
It's been so long I never thought I would have seen you again
So that's why, girl I don't want to let you go
That's why, feeling starts let you know
That's why, baby girl don't tell me no
Why don't we try our love again?
So that's why, you're the woman I should be with
That's why, miss you more than a little bit
That's why, think I have had enough of this
Why don't we try our love again?
It's been so long has been quite a while
It's been so long since I seen that smile
It's been so long since I had you close to me
It's been so long so much has changed
It's been so long girl I take the blame
It's been so long but I knew someday I'll see you again
I used to have you here with me
I think about you constantly
And I just had to let you know
Can't remember why I let you go
But here we got us a second chance
The answers are our true romance
And we don't have to be alone
It's time for you to come on home

This may be the last thing that I write for long
Can you hear me smiling when I sing this song, for you and only you
As I leave will you be someone to say good-bye
As I leave will you be someone to wipe your eye
My foot is out the door, and you can't stop me now
You wanted the best, it wasn't me, will you give it back
Now I'll take the lead, when there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive, is this what you want
Is this what you need, how you end up let me know.
As I go, remember all the simple things you know,
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when
I'm gone
This is the last song
The hearts start breaking as the year is gone
The dream's beginning and the time rolls on
It seems so surreal, now I sing it.
Somehow I knew that I would be this way,
Somehow I knew that I would slowly fade.
Now I'm gone, just try and stop me now.
And will you need me now, you'll find a way somehow
You want it too, I want it too.

Thinkin' back in time
Someone said that love was blind
But they were wrong
You just choose not to see me
When it's right before your eyes
You'd rather compromise
Then give your all
Then it don't turn out
The way it's supposed to be
Time and time again you disappoint
When she believes
Just do your best
And give her what she needs
And
[Chorus]
Cherish her love
Show her she's right where she belongs
Take care of her heart
Before she's gone
Cherish her love
It might be hard to conceive
You gotta see the forest
Despite the trees
Before it all burns down
Not tellin' ya nothing you don't know
But she'll let you have your fun
But when a woman's done when she's done
And then she'll go
Just when you're needin' her the most
Time and time again you disappoint
When she believes
Do all you can
Do give her what she needs
[Chorus]
And if you care about the weather
Keep her safe and warm
Let nothing in between stand in your way
They say it's calm inside the eye of the storm
Together come whatever
Come what may
Just
[Chorus]

Action's being taken 'cos of this,
You fucked with us and now we're really pissed.
A hundred times you tried to shut us out,
But silence isn't golden, hear us shout.
(Chorus)
Can't you see we're just too fast,
Diehard youth we're made to last (x2)
Diehard youth we're comin'!

Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow, yeah
And everywhere the child went
That little lamb was sure to go now.
He followed her to school one day
Which broke the teachers rule
But what a time did they have
That day at school.
Tisket! Tasket! baby
A green and yellow basket
Sent a letter to by baby
And on my way I past it.
Express myself.

I'm gonna wait til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumblin' down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am, oh, yes, I am
(One more thing I want to say right here)
I'm gonna wait 'til the stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
You're the only girl I know
That really loves me so
In the midnight hour
Oh, yeah, in the midnight hour
(Yeah! All right - play it for me one time now)
I'm gonna wait til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumblin' down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around
Just you and I...oh, baby, hah!
Just you and I...nobody around, baby, just you and I
All right...you know what?
I'm gonna hold you in my arms

I want change to happen!
I want Social justice!
I want Service! Programs!
No don't drink that wine.
So many huge decisions
Are made in corporate board rooms
What about the streets of our city?
Will we drink that wine? Will we trust those who know
Will we venture out in faith, Confess what we don't know
In a perfect world things are rarely what they seem
Reality could be a dream
Who will we listen to and who will we trust
Will we trickle down or will we trickle up
Who will decide what the answers will be
What do we want? Rabbi we want to see
My mustard seed will grow
It's growing into a mountain mover
My crippled leg is showing
But I'm going to the head of the table
My worst his best, most honored guest
The seed is growing stronger
Throw the mountains into the sea
Move the mountains inside of me
The mustard seed against the world
Perfect world imperfect world
I want "Bottom Up" justice
At the bottom of justice
Surely the wineskin of justice
Surely the cup of mercy
Will overflow into the streets of the world
Soon will come the time
To drink of His new wine

The hand that feeds you, needs you
Greeds you, bleeds you
Grieves you, leaves you
Greets you, eats you

They would never hurt you
You could never understand
In ignorance you bite the hand
Hand that supplies you, denies you
Relieves you, deceives you
Excites you, unites you
Violates you, sedates you
Bite the...

I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home
(And ooh yeah, now)
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day,
You know it's always been that way
(Ooh yeah, now)
And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop (ooh, ya'll)
The girl is right on time now (come on)
Her loving arms are there to greet me,
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me.
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way
(One woman's making my home)
One women's making my home
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no baby
I got to decide where I belong.
(One woman's making my home)
Sometimes I get so mixed up inside
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
I wish I could find a place to hide
I didn't mean, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no girl
I got to decide, where I belong
(One woman's making my home)
Baby baby baby...

You got me walkin' the floor
Like I never walked before
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
You know that's not fair
You got me pullin' out my hair
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
Because a good man is hard to find
I said a good man is hard to find
You hurt me so
I just had to let you know
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
Because a good man is hard to find
I said a good man is hard to find
You hurt me so
I just had to let you know
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
To hurt a good hearted man
To hurt a good hearted man

And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night my tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I'll hope and I'll pray that maybe someday
You'll be back in my arms once again
Someone, help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above
How can I, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love

You went away and left me long time ago
Now you come back'n knockin' on my door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
Now you come back tellin' all those lies
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
If you had a lesson long time ago
You wouldn't be goin' from door to door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
You went away and left me long time ago
Now you come back'n knockin' on my door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
Now you come back tellin' all those lies
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
If you had a lesson long time ago
You wouldn't be goin' from door to door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been

I know you
So better than the city in the rear view
I drive to
Eliminate the ball that I'm chained to
Take me break me
Every mile further there's a part of me that slips away
One day you'll see
Even if you got down on your knees you couldn't make me stay
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight fight fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
Pulse stays strong
I'm pushing on the pedal til I break dawn
So I'm gone, go find another shoulder you can cry on
Take me break me
Every mile further there's a part of me that slips away
One day you'll see
Even if you got down on your knees you couldn't make me stay
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight fight fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm going to have to drive all night
All of the things that you knew that I'd try
All of the things that I held inside
All I gotta do is drive
Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all
Fight fight fight
All you want to do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night
You wrecked my life
So I'm gonna have to drive all night

It's not that I don't love you,you know how much I do. And it's not that I've found someone to take the place of you.It's just a fear that builds within me everytime you touch my hand.And a dread that shakes my body,that even I don't understand,so I'm leaving.This time I'm playing it smart.I'm gonna walk away from love before love breaks my heart.
Oh you're clenging to me tighter than you ever have before.I don't understand it.But I know it's gonna take everything I've got to keep walking out the door.But those arms you've got around me will let me go someday.And I'd rather leave you holding on,than pushing me away,so I'm leaving yes I am.This time I'm playing it smart.I'm gonna walk away from love before love breaks my heart.

I am white and I've got everything I need
No one clutches their purses when they're in a room alone with me
And I can drive through any neighborhood I please
At any hour, and the police don't do a thing
So, if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I'm a guy getting paid more than a girl with a degree
And I can walk in the streets after dark, no one wants to rape me
And I can get a girl pregnant and just as easily flee
Just like my straight, white male dad did to me
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I've got a pile of broken mirrors, and I'm walking under ladders
And I'm spilling tons of salt because to me that doesn't matter
'Cause my skin and my gender and my orientation
Are the best things to have when you live in this nation
I recommend it highly
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
Shit's gonna work out for me
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need

Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Hey little baby don't you cry,
Mama gonna drop around,
Hey little baby don't say a word,
Mama gonna whoop you 'bout somethin' you heard.
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Mama gonna buy you a diamond ring,
If that diamond ring's brass,
Mama gonna buy a lookin' glass,
If that lookin' glass is broke,
Mama gonna buy a horse and coach,
If that horse and coach turn over,
Mama gonna buy you a dog named Rover.
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (Hush your mouth!)
A coonskin alligator hide,
Make into shoes baby, jus' like mine,
Don't be scared to put 'em on your feet,
Scared 'bout me, jus' can't be beat.
Hush your mouth!
Hush your mouth!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
There's a gulf war vet, dying a slow, cold death
And the government says, "We don't know the source of his sickness"
But don't believe what they say, because your government is lying
They've done it before and don't you know they'll do it again
A secret test, government built virus
Subject test group gulf battle field troops
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
First world war veterans slaughtered, by General Eisenhower
You give them your life, they give you a stab in the back
Radiation, agent orange, tested on us souls
Guinea pigs for western corporations
I never have, I never will
Pledge allegiance to their flag
You're getting used, you'll end up dead
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
I don't need you to tell me what to do
And I don't need you to tell me what to be, fuck you
I don't need you to tell me what to say
And I don't need you to tell me what to think! What to think
What to think, what to think, what to think, think, think, think
You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit

Once was a sweet thang baby, held our love in our hands
Now I reach to kiss your lips, the touch don't mean a thing
And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag.
A cold shot baby, I let our love go bad
Remember the way that you loved me, do anything I say
Now I see you out somewhere, you won't give me the time of day
And that's a cold shot darlin', yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad
I really meant I was sorry, for ever causin' you pain
You showed your appreciation, by walkin' out anyway
And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad
Don't let our true love run cold baby

I'm so glad that we've had this time together
On my radio and right on my TV
There's no predicting the shortness of forever
And why the plan is always difficult to see
'Cause you were taken so unexpectedly
Another day, another hour
Another chance to see you wasn't meant to be
Another moment, another second
If I could tell you just how much you mean to me
I wish I could tell you just how much you mean to me
Have no choice but to wallow in my sorrow
For just a moment we are here and then we're gone
I guess I thought that we'd always have tomorrow
But the magic in your music lingers on
I just wish that you were here to sing along
Another day, another hour
Another chance to see you wasn't meant to be
Another moment, another second
If I could tell you just how much you mean to me
I wish I could tell you just how much you mean to me
So many questions but no answers why
I wished I had the chance to say goodbye
Another day, another hour
Another chance to see you wasn't meant to be
Another moment, another second
I would tell you just how much you meant to me
I would tell you just how much you mean to me
I wish I could tell you just how much you mean to me

Hello Josephine, how do you do?
Do you remember me, baby, like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler "woo-woo-woo"
I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella every time it rained
You used to cry so much, it was a crying shame
You used to live over yonder by the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk, I used to tote you on my back
Now you try to make-believe there was no days like that
Hello Josephine, how do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler "woo-woo-woo"

On the horizon out where the ocean greets the sky
On the horizon I saw a ship go sailing by
This was the ship that I'd often dreamed of
A ship made of gold with a golden sail above
This was the ship that I dreamed would someday bring my love
On the horizon out where the lonely seagulls cry
On the horizon my ship of dreams came sailing by
Sailing to me with this cargo so rare
It kept comin' closer and closer I swear
Closer and closer 'til I woke up and found you there
Oh, on the horizon, the horizon, the horizon

Well I know this girl named Bonita
She's what all the boys call a freaka
And if you don't want to get fined/
Fired don't you put no swine on her plate
And I know this man from the islands
He want boom boom for the batty man
But I heard from above the true meaning of one love
But who are we to give up on anyone
And he that is without sin first cast the stone
Judge not lest ye be judged with the same judgment
Well I know this dude who's a pusher
He got any drug you can think of
And he'll sling it your way every day but the Sabbath day
And I know this small sect of Muslims
Who don't like drug dealers so they kill 'em
But every three from afar you can hear them praying to Allah
So who are we to give up on anyone
And he that is without sin first cast the stone
Judge not lest ye be judged with the same judgment
But who are we to give up on anyone
And he that is without sin first cast the stone
Judge not lest ye be judged with the same judgment
Same judgment
Same judgment
Same judgment
I'm married to the backslider, we are in love
So who are you to talk about a life that I have touched
Be a people person
Be a people person
And I know this girl named Bonita
Her names Bonita
They call her freaka
Well I know this dude who's a preacher
You can feel the anointing when he meets ya
But I refuse to ignore he be bitch for the deacon board
And I know this woman who be praying
Hear them spiritual words she be saying
But put a drink in her hand and she'll curse you like a sailor man
But who are we to give up on anyone
And he that is without sin first cast the stone
Judge not lest ye be judged with the same judgment
But who are we to give up on anyone
And he that is without sin first cast the stone
Judge not lest ye be judged with the same judgment
And I know this girl named Bonita

Ah, you build me up, build me up and
Just to let me down, let me down and
Then you fill my cup, fill my cup and
Turn my love around, all around
Why do you take me where my love can't go?
Why do you make me love you more and more?
I don't have the Eiffel tower, silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is the greatest story ever told
Don't have the Eiffel tower, anything might die
Well, I love you, um, love you and that will survive
Why do you have to start, have to start that
Just to break my heart, break my heart, oh?
Tear it all apart, all apart and
Then you let it stop, let it stop
I can't stand it, baby, you, you move me so
And my love gets started, it goes and goes and goes and
This is not a dream and what love ought to make
Sometimes you just can see [Incomprehensible]
Don't have the Eiffel Tower or silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is worth more and more and more
I want to stay this time
I, oh, wanna make you mine
And now, yeah, want to stay this time, yeah
I wanna make you mine
And I love you, baby, I

Over all the earth
You reign on high
Every mountain stream
Every sunset sky
But my one request
Lord my only aim
Is that you reign in me again
Lord reign in me
Reign in your power
Over all my dreams
In my darkest hour
You are the Lord of all I am
So won't you reign in me again
Over every thought
Over every word
May my life reflect
The beauty of my Lord
You mean more to me
Than any earthly thing
So won't you reign in me again

Without a word of warning
The blues walked in this morning
And circled round my lonely room
I didn't know why I had
That sad and lonely feeling
Until my baby called and said we're through, ooo
Woah yesterday, this time I sang a love song
But today I'm singin' the blues
Mmm, it strikes me kind of funny
How love can be this way
We were lovers last night, honey
But I'm alone again today
It strikes me kind of funny
How fate can be unfair
I come out on the losin' end
In every, every love affair
Yes it must be, must be written for me
That I should be the one, be the one to always lose
For yesterday, yesterday, this time I sang a love song
Oh, oh but right now I sing the blues, oh yeah

Adorable, dorable, dorable, dorable baby
You're adorable, sweet as can be
You're adorable, a dream girl to me
You're all that I hoped my love would ever be
(Adorable, dorable, dorable, dorable baby)
You're so lovable, when you're in my arms
You're so kissable, when I hold your charms
You're mine, you are so divine, my adorable one, dorable one
You must have come from he-heaven
Because you thrill me so
My heaven starts at seven sharp
You start my heart to glow, glow, glow
(You start my heart)
You're so huggable, so clinging, so nice
You're excitable when kissed once or twice
And soon you'll be mine alone, you adorable one
(Adorable, dorable, dorable, dorable baby)

true love
i should have known
that true love
to you still blows

Somebody To Love
Written by Babyface(1999 from the album Wonder No.8)
Performed by Honeyz
Intro-spoken
Each day I pray
For love to come my way
And I'm still here looking
But not knowing where to find you
So I ask myself
Besoin d'aime
Besoin d't aime
Verse 1
I've been waiting for so very long
To find someone that I could call my own but I know
That one day I'll find the perfect love
The kind of love that every girl prays for
B-section
Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
But I'm strong
So I keep holding on
'Til I find a love of my life
Chorus
(I need somebody to love me)
Someone to love me
(To love me)
For the rest of my life
(Sometimes when days get so lonely)
I need someone to hold me
(To love me)
Who'll make it all right
Verse 2
Some people wonder how a girl like me
Could even know, know the meaning of love
(Meaning of love)
I may be young, but I've been around
And yes, I know
That I've had my ups and my downs
I need someone who will stay with me till the end
So please tell me when
Will I find that special friend?
Chorus
(I need somebody to love me)
Someone to love me
(To love me)
For the rest of my life

I need someone to hold me
(To love me)
Who'll make it all right
Bridge
Every Juliet needs a Ro-Romeo
(Romeo)
Someone who'll be there and never let go
(Never let go)
He may be near or he may be far
I don't know
(Ah)
Until he's here
(Hes Here)
I wish on a star
(Star)
Oh oh oh...

Hatred I can't stand it anymore.
The color of our skin we must ignore.
Do you feel the pain or see the hurt,
Or do you let it pass right by instead?
(Chorus)
This fighting, dividing, y'know we'll only lose (x2)
How come we can stand for such a crime,
Racial hate, a real sign of the times.
We've gotta raise our voice, begin the fight
And equal world held high is in our sight.
(Repeat Chorus)
Is this prejudice a way of life, tell me!
Do you wanna be just like your friends, pressure!
Is it 'cos you just jumped by someone, is it?
You're condemning those who choose to live, unfair!

Oh, I, I, I, baby, I love you so
You know, you know, I love you so.
All my life I been lovin' you,
Sometimes I wonder, baby, what you're gonna do.
You told me honey, that our love's unreal,
I can't be with you 'cause you won't be filled.
You keep tellin' all our closest friends,
That you were with me from the very beginin',
I, I, yeah, I love you so.
In the morning, it's alright,
In the evening, it's still alright,
In the night, it's alright,
Where you be, it's still alright.
I, I, love you

Did ya have a bad day
Well sometimes shit go that way
Come on let me rub your feet
Baby I know just what you need so
Move along to your back
Or maybe you'd like to take a bath
Come on in the water's fine
All you gotta do is ask for
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I'm takin this from A to Z tonight
Girl I'll take it nice and slow
It's not about me it's whatever you like
Girl i'll try to be your man for life
Baby you don't have to go no not tonight
Forget all about the pain
Let my fingers take the pain away
Lay back, relax your mind
Don't think about the time 'cause we got all night
Don't worry bout a thing
For you i'll do anything, just want to make it clear
I'm so glad I got your here
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I'm takin this from A to Z tonight
Girl I'll take it nice and slow
It's not about me it's whatever you like
Girl I'll try to be your man for life
Baby you don't have to go
You're the only one that matters, I'll never leave you
Just want to please you, girl you know how much I need you
Baby I swear, don't have to worry
Be there for you, I got to have you...in my life
Whatever you want, whatever you need

Girl I'll try to be your man for life
Baby you don't have to go

There's so much to be happy about
In this life what a wonderful chance
We have to work hard, play hard
And maybe even find yourself a girl
And make some romance
So don't you think It'd be so lame
To get all crazy drunk
And start a fight?
We'd much rather dance with some girls
So if you want to fight
Get the heck outta here you stupid fool!
Please don't kill us
We're just the Aquabats
We're just trying to have
A little fun
Ha ha ha ha
So if you want to fight
We can duke it out
Just please don't kill us
With your gun
We're all just peaceful little Aquabats
We would never take a life
We don't want to fight
But if we must,
Please be cool,
No guns or knives.
[x2]

You used to fly low
But now you're flying high
But what goes up must come down
That's why I'm leaving this old town
So bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye
You know me, me no good in your heart
That's why I'm singing this song
Bye, bye, baby bye bye
You don't want me around
That's why I'm leaving this old town
So bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye
So long, so long baby, baby I must go
You know you told me, you don't want me, anymore
You told me to pack my clothes
You told me to hit the road
So bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye, bye baby, baby bye bye

Lying alone in my room
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Trying to figure out if this is it, this time
Just can't stop thinking 'bout the way
You make me feel inside
I just can't get you off my mind
No matter how hard I try
Could you be the one for me?
Could we dance the night away?
I wanna give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me?
Could you love me the rest of my life?
Could you forever be the one for me this time?
I walk around in a daze
The ice is melting from my heart
How can I ever know if you feel the same?
Are you the sunshine that's begging me
To come in from the rain
Or have you come into my life
To turn around and take your love away?
Could you be the one for me?
Could we dance the night away?
I wanna give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me?
Could you love me the rest of my life?
Could you forever be the one for me this time?
When I look into your eyes
They tell me that you're mine
But I keep asking myself
Could you be the one for me?
Could we dance the night away?
I wanna give you everything
Though I don't have much
Could you fall in love with me?
And could you love me the rest of my life?
Could you forever be the one for me this time?
Could you forever be the one for me this time?

Well yeah, we're the freaks of nature
We're the kids that easily bruise
We're the geeks and the creatures
Outer space hillbillies from the moon
Get stupid on your time
Keep your geriatric biker fight
Diffuse the land mines
I'm alright
You're Alright
We're Alright
Well we both know that our day will come
The revolution has begun
So raise your fists and take a stand
With your super cool...
Super cool wrist bands!
We broke out
And now we're running crazy
Down the middle of the boulevard
(Spaced out!)
There's a nerd alert
There's a nerd alert
And you'll never, ever
Never take us alive
Never take us alive
You'll never...!
We're fat, young and hungry
But we don't care
We got big old brains
Like Mexican candy
We got some complex flavor
Running up in here
So get stupid on your time
Get the bud bowl off the air
Diffuse the land mines
I'm alright
You're alright
We're alright
You know that your apathy
Became your enemy
And you did yourself in
Find out this phenomenon
Is running on and on
And we'll never give in...
We broke out
Now we're running crazy
Down the middle of the boulevard
(Spaced out!)
There's a nerd alert
There's a nerd alert
And you'll never, ever
Never take us alive
Never take us alive
Never take us alive
Live...

Deep river, my home is over Jordan
Deep river, you know I got long to stay here
You know I got long to stay here
My calling down the thunder
From this land just wait for me
Just wait, swimming the ocean
I make it love for you baby
Deep river, oh, I over drown
Deep river, I want to cross over into camp-ground.
You want I want to cross over into camp-ground.

Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter
I'm sealing up this letter
I just finished signing your name
My friends would all be surprised
If they knew I was playing this game
I'll pretend it's a special delivery
And just to give me a hint
I'll use your favorite color
Smear it with your favorite scent
Huh, I know you think that I'm crazy
But I can't loose, what have I left
So I've decided to write this letter
And send it to myself
So to make my story short
In the mail box I will place
This letter that I wrote
And it's stamped with your lovely face
When I'm alone
And I need someone to talk to
I talk to your picture
Get me a pencil and paper (Pencil and paper)
And write all the things
Say all the things
I've heard you say before
But with a little extra
(Extra, extra, read all about it)
Sugar and spice
I guess it makes me feel kind of nice
I write a letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh...write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write a letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh...I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
What is a home when you're all alone
It seems so full
It seems so full, but so empty
(Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...)
So I put my coat
Leave you a note
And go to the places, places, places where we used to be
I pretend you are there
Order dinner for two
Your every presence is all in the air
I write a letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh...I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter), mmm, hmm
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter), oh, yeah
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter(
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)

Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness
Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting
Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it
No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness
Yeah
Damn that hart (hard?)
All you got to do is know how to love her
You've got to
Hold her
Squeeze her
Never leave her
Now get to her
Got got got to try a little tenderness
Yeah yeah
Lord have mercy now
All you got to do is take my advice
You've got to hold her
Don't squeeze her
Never leave her
You've got to hold her
And never
So you got to try a little tenderness
A little tenderness
A little tenderness
A little tenderness
You've got to
Got to got to
You've gotta hold her
Don't squeeze her
Never leaver her
You got
Got got got to
Now now now
Got got got to
Try a little tenderness
Ye

Violence isn't an answer to problems you've got
But people sure use the excuse here a lot
If you don't like someone or how they look
Show 'em your hatred with a left hook
How silly is this shit-its making me sick
Ruining fun by acting like pricks
I look around and see so much gone wrong
How much longer can this crap go on?
[Chorus]
Has everyone all gone crazy?
I think everyone's all gone crazy!
Has everyone all gone crazy?
I think I'm going-gone-CRAZY!
You pay eights bucks to get into the show
But it gets cut off early 'cause there's a fight-way to go!
I'm tired of calling it an early night
Because some tough bonehead went picking a fight
Someone once called your friend you now call a foe
So you "even the score" by striking a blow
This petty nonsense is giving punk a bad name
And hooligans like you are putting good kids to shame
[Chorus]
How many more kids do you have to drop?
How many more venues will close before this stops?
How many more good times must come to a halt?
You can't even answer 'cause' you know you're at fault
[Chorus]

Now's the time for all good men
to get together with one another.
We got to iron out our problems
and iron out our quarrels
and try to live as brothers.
And try to find a piece of land
without stepping on one another.
And do respect the women of the world.
Remember you all have mothers.
We got to make this land a better land
than the world in which we live.
And we got to help each man be a better man
with the kindness that we give.
I know we can make it.
I know darn well we can work it out.
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out.
And we gotta take care of all the children,
the little children of the world.
'cause they're our strongest hope for the future,
the little bitty boys and girls.
We got to make this land a better land
than the world in which we live.
And we got to help each man be a better man
with the kindness that we give.
I know we can make it.
I know darn well we can work it out.
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna, yes we can can.

There's an old friend
That I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been runnin' ever since
He said it's been a long time comin'
But I know my change is gonna come
Oh yeah
He said it's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
I might not be if I knew
What was up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time comin'
But I know my change has got to come
Oh yeah
I went, I went to my brother
And I asked him, "Brother
Could you help me, please?"
He said, "Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able"
And when I, when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees
Yes I was, oh

Could it be that I can't stand to be alone?
This long distance has us livin' on the phone
Ever since you've been away
I just can't get through a day
Girl, I just can't wait to have you
Here at home, oh baby
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Sometimes I only get to see you for a day
If that's all I can get then that's what I'll take
'Cause soon I know the day will come
When you and I will be as one
But right now this thing gets so hard
For me to say, oh baby
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
(Could we make love just one more time?)
I don't want you to go
(Can you feel forever, this our last and final try?)
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye, boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go
Every time we say goodbye boo
I don't want you to go

I worry, I wonder all the time why worry
It's killing me, forget about it
I whisper, remember what she did
Don't miss her
Set me free, she won't allow it
Angry and gone, and the list goes on and on
Now I'm letting up, I should be the one who's letting go
She's lonely, she's scared, I'm relationship impaired
If it's love, I will differ, I'm being lost being with her
I can't move on, I can't take it
She, she says we won't ma-a-ake it now
I can't move on, I can't take it
She, she says we won't ma-a-ake it now
Be-lieving, the things I did were wrong
I'm leaving
It fades a-way, forget about it
She's binding, can't do a thing alone
Rewinding
Times before, can't live without it
I don't know
But you did but you did ut yo-ou did
Please don't go
Now my feelings for you they're now lost
'Cause we're through anymore
I'll write you , I'll call you
Now

Him and her
Life is turned.
The day I knew you would leave
I can barely breath
Can you hear me scream
O-o-o thrown in all directions
You epitome of perfection
She's lost her will,
Time is standing still
He walks, her, home
Now he walks a-lone
The days they turn into years
The eyes they drown in tears
Can you hear me scream
The way we are the way they were
(It's just a shadow of what's wrong)
The time with you the time is stirred
(I love you for , so long)
The hearts they turn, they turn away
(she says to go please don't you cry)
Love lost was found, night turns to day
Time is standing still

One, two
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all
Hard luck and trouble is my only friend
I been on my own ever since I was ten
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all
I can't read, haven't learned how to write
My whole life has been one big fight
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all
I ain't lyin'
If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no kind-a luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all
Wine and women is all I crave
A big legged woman is gonna carry me to my grave
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all
Yeah, my bad luck boy
Been havin' bad luck all of my days, yes

[Hook]
We come from forts and expeditions
slangin' papers with ambition
Cause back in my younger days
that's just how we make a living
Thats how I was thought to grind
learnt to hustle from my moms
Thats that G shit and the G simply stands for grind
[Verse]
(Grind', Grind', Grind', Grind', Grind')
Imma drop this shit for the hell of it
Cause Im outchea gridin' can't tell me shit
People ask me why you took so long,
how you go so strong
cause it's timing to all this shit,
when a nigga try to let his past go
get reminded of all his shit
Niggas dont go as hard as I do
I be Fighting for all that i get
I gotta question
why you hatin' on me,
cause I'm probably grindin' his bitch
Everybody who was checkin' for a nigg
a and was reppin' for a nigga
I appreciate your prayers I respect you my nigga, a lot of these lames keept hatin' on a nigga
When I took a little fall you was steppin' on a nigga, if you keep it one then I salute you my nigga
If I see you comin' for my I shoot you my nigga, but im grindin' like I got something to prove my nigga
Bet you couldn't walk a mile in my shoes my nigga,
lot of my niggas ain't here this year
I cried for all my nigga,
love everybody in my squad
I'd die for all them niggas
I give a fuck bout all these rumors, cause the truth will ever be in them, and they love to see when i'm losin'
So they hate to see when im winnin', decked out house on the hill I made it,barely 22 but im bout my business
If theres a million dollar club i'm in it,
determined to get it so this shit don't phase me
Even though Im Me I see no competition I refuse to be defeated
A lot of these nigga ain't breaking it off, I chase this check for my family and all
I just got out of a coma it showed me that when God is for me no weapon can hold me
Thats why I go hard for N.O. and my homies
and I pay homage for niggas before me
Who came back and told me go hard like Ginobili and grind for all this shit
Doctor tell me I'm exhausted and shit, can't stop now I'm never gone quit
Not until I see my mama not wantin' for nothing, and I see my brothers just livin' for a livin'
And I see my squad spending money like its nothing, that why i'm grindin' everyday till to make a way because
[Hook]
We come from forts and expeditions, slangin' papers with ambition
Cause back in my younger days that's just how we make a living
Thats how I was thought to grind learnt to hustle from my moms
Thats that G shit and the G simply stands for grind
[Outro]
Imma drop this shit for the hell of it
Cause Im outchea gridin' can't tell me shit

I have heard of a land on the far away strand,
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, where we never shall die,
'Tis a land where we never grow old.
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old.
In that beautiful home where well never more roam,
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing,
'Tis a land where we never shall die.
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old.

Way down in Louisiana
Down in Cajun land

Diggin' on'a scubadie
Ooh boog-a-boo you

What I like to do to you, boy
You ooh boog-a-boo you
You ooh boog-a-boo you, baby
Get hip to the consultation of the boolawee

I never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth
It's me for you
Tonight you can't imagine that I'm by your side
Cause it's never gonna be the truth
Too far for you
But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
Take everything that I know you'll break
And I give my life away
So far for you
But can you hear me say
Don't throw me away
There's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
Tonight I'm weak
It's just another day without you
That I can't sleep
I gave the world away for you to
Hear me say
Don't throw me away
There's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
All I wanna do is touch you
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me

You're beatin' up on your friends,
'Cos you're so insecure,
You wanna be the toughest,
But we all know for sure,
You thrash because you know
You're gonna start another fight,
But maybe when it's too late,
You'll finally see the light,
(Chorus)
You're tough, you fight, you win, so what! (x2)
You listen to the music,
It's the coolest thing to do,
But you don't ever listen
To what it says to you.
Your boots don't make you bigger,
Your pose is nothing new,
Someday it's gonna happen
When we watch you fuckin' lose
(Repeat Chorus x4)

I've got to breathe, you can't take that from me
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
You had to leave and that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind
I know there are times you're so impossible
That I should sign a waiver
And you will find someone worth walking on
When you ask me to go
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
There was a day you threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay but since you wanna play
We can finally say we're through
I know there are times you're so impossible
And you ask me to go
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave but just know
As I lay in solitude, oh what's a boy supposed to do?
I shake the very thought of you, me together I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late all I do is wait and wait
You're never coming home to me, that's the hardest thing to see
I've got to breathe, you can't take that from me
I can finally say we're through
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
On every face you'll ever know
And everywhere you'll ever go
You'll feel when the wind blows

I should warn you
Things you're feeling, aren't normal now.
Think you need me
It's not easy, let you go some how.
Now we're too far gone,
Hope is such a waste
Every breath you take you give
Me the burdens bitter taste
You promise that you'd stay
You say you want to go
Your lips provide a shelter for the
Things that I don't know
Please speak slowly
My heart is learning
Teach me heart-ache,
Stop this burning now.

Mase and Brian McKnight
Bay Boy we dont' stop, we rock we rock
Yo,I hit you the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gig playing two point eight
Near studded, jewel flooded, got to love it
First rap cat with an R&B; budget
Everyday on the TV, me and PD
Girls see PD, make their man break the CD
Why ya'll forever rowdy, I'll be outie
Somewhere in Maui, 'til I go back to Cali
Can't understand how he can treat you
The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me
Oh so baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine
If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine
Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life
Oh so, baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down I'll always be around
And you should be mine
If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine
Yo, what the deal honey, insecure, feeling funny
I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PHD
Girl, come into my world
I'll love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries no more, girl open the door
And don't waste your time
'Cause you should be mine
If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine

Me and you
Let's get away from it all
Me and you
Havin' a ball
You know
We've been together a long time
And you know what
We can get a little old lightweight thang goin'
If we really put our hearts to it
You try and I try
Girl, there's no tellin' how far we can go
Remember those lovin' fools Romeo and Juliet
They thought they had a thing goin'
But they just didn't know, they couldn't visualize
They had no idea how it would really be
But we know
Me and you
Let's get away
Me and you
Havin' a ball
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Yes, Lord
We know, don't we, darlin'
We won't be wastin' our time fussin' and fightin'
Like other people
We're gonna be too busy bein' in love
But love, this is the real thing
We found a groove, heh
We move each other
We turn each other on
This could last forever
All we need to do is give some kinda sign
Yes, Lord
From then on, baby, it's easy
Let's talk about me and you
Me and you
Let's get away
Me and you

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey mama look at little sis
Out in the backyard playin' like this
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey look at little sister
Hey hey hey hey look at little sister
What about the neighbors what they gonna say
Stop little sister gettin' carried away
Hey hey hey look at little sister
Hey hey hey hey look at little sister
Shakin' like a tree rollin' like a log
Shakin' and a rollin' now that ain't all
Hey hey hey look at little sister
Hey hey hey hey look at little sister
Shakin' like a tree rollin' like a log
Shakin' and a rollin' now that ain't all
Hey hey hey look at little sister
Hey hey hey hey look at little sister

I came into this world
As a puzzled panther
Waiting to be caged
But something stood in the way
I was never quite tamed
Crossed paths of right and wrong
Saw them take their toll
I saw the armies march
And like animals they crawled
Evolution is a process
Too slow to save my soul
I've got this creature on my back
It just won't let go
Ha ha ha
If I am only an animal
Then I can do no wrong
But they say something better
So I've got to hang on

We see her cum around
Looking like a busted hound
She cums to all the shows
Ready to take off her clothes
For any guy in a band
As her pride slips her hand
She's got crabs
She's got the drip
She's a whore
She's damaged goods
She's got herpes
She's got aids
She's got it all
She's damaged goods
She always walks down the street
Acting like she's so sweet
But the truth we all know
She's nothing but an easy ho
If she only understood that
All she is, is damaged goods
She's a loose legged bitch
She only comes around to suck dick
Guys get her with ease
As she spreads a nasty disease
She should be tested 'cause
She must be infested

Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right, yeah
Oh, we got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump right in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine
City traffic movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?
Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit 'til we get
To the other side, ide, ide
With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' along
Who knows how far our car can get
Before you think your love slowin' on down
City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go come on now, go
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac? Oh yeah
Here we go, one more time mmm
With the wind and your fingers in my hair
Kind of think we're going for an extended throw down
So drop the top baby
And let's cruise on into this better than ever street
City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, come on baby, go, do it for me now
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against my back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?
What I want you to do baby
Get over to the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh yeah
Take the love that's sent ya
And then in the right time
Go on over in love and satisfaction and joy, well
Ain't we riding babe, ain't we cruising down
Free, free, sweet
Go on after, awh let's be good to each other street
Well, see that little landmark over there
A whole lot of kisses and sweet stuff
We'll be just about, awh, awh, awh
And satisfaction road yeah, satisfaction yeah ooo ahhh

Look here girls, take this advice, and remember always in life
Into each heart, some tears must fall
Though you love and loose, you must stand tall
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes, I said, sigh sometimes
Pull yourself together, no use crying forever
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea
My mama once told me something and every word is true
Don't waste your time on a fella who doesn't love you
He'll only mislead you, only grieve you
Don't worry about him baby, you can do it without him
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea
Well, if that fish isn't on your line
Bait your hook and keep on trying
You don't let him get you down
There's other boys around
There's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't need nobody that don't need me
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me now
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me?
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me now?
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me?
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the, too many fish in the sea

Her ass, it's arrived and something's wrong
And to find it out won't take you long

Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do between us
That managed to tear us apart
But oh I believe if we work real hard
We can get through, through it this time
Girl just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing that we can't get through
[Chorus:]
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you, babe
To stay with me
Trust never came between us
And that's just the way that we are
It's the crazy things we do between us
That managed to break both our hearts
But oh I believe that we can survive
Through anything if we'd only try
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I can't stop
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm depending on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm depending on
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?
You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing, that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Such a shame
Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame
I don't know
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?
You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing, that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Some people are made of plastic
And you know some people are made of wood
Some people have hearts of stone
Some people are up to no good
But baby I'm for real
I'm as real as real can get
If what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
I said what you see is what you get now baby
And the real thing is the best thing yet
You know some people
Are made of lies to bring you down
And shame your name
But baby, I have good intentions

If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe
Now I know what I have found
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love

Can't you see you're in quicksand!
It's gonna take more than a hand to pull you out
It's like rowing on dry land.
You keep sinking -- deeper, deeper!
And the more you try to fight, you keep getting weaker
There's only one way to do right
Is to leave wrong alone
Anything worth having won't come easy
And if it do, boy -- pass it on!
You're in quicksand!
It's gonna take more than a man to pull you out (Oh, yeah)
You keep sinking -- deeper, deeper!
And the more you try to fight, you kept getting weaker
There's only one way to do right
Is to leave -- leave wrong alone
Anything worth having won't come easy
And if it do, you better pass it on!
(Awh!) Quicksand!
(Ooh!) Quicksand!
You're sunk in quicksand!
(Oooh!) Quicksand!
(Hey!)
(Oh!) Y'all, you've got yourself in a world of trouble --
Trouble... (Yeah!...)

You can play the game and you can act out the part
Though you know it wasn't written for you
But tell me, how can you stand there with your broken heart
Ashamed of playing the fool
One thing can lead to another; it doesn't take any sacrifice
Oh, father and mother,and sister and brother
if it feels nice, don't think twice (yes)
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be just fine if you only will(do as i say, yeah)
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do with your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody the way that you feel
You can feel it beginning to ease
I think it's true what they say about the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease.
Better to shower the people you love with love
(Yes and) show them the way that you feel
(I know) Things are gonna be just fine if you only will
(what i'd like to do to you)
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
They say in every life
They say the rain must fall
Just like the pouring rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Love, love, love is sunshine oh
Make it rain
Love, love, love is sunshine yeah
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody

Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Please swallow your pride
If I have faith you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show
You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me (call me)

Get ready to, make a stand
Get ready to, make a stand
'Cause if, we don't, fuckin', do it
Then no one's goin' to, no
Have you seen the scene on the street?
Do you care what's, goin' on?
Thousands, homeless, in the land of the free
But no one seems to think it's wrong
That's why we fuckin' wrote this song
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
This ship is sinkin', it's time we set it right
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
When the standards of, society
Are based, solely on greed
Humanity, compassion, do not define
What it means to succeed, no
For the poor, contempt and hate
From the rich, middle class, the state
Compassion, dumped for, apathy
The greatest nation ever seen?
That's fuckin' real hard to believe
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
This ship is sinkin', it's time we set it right
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
Socialized, socialized, mechanized, mechanized
To consume, everything in the world
Saturate, saturate, accumulate, accumulate
Your happiness, can be bought and be sold
Environment, environment, detriment, detriment
Is not, an issue of concern
Humanity, humanity or this insanity, insanity
The choice is yours and your choice alone
But you won't be alone
No, you won't be alone, yeah
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand

Take to the streets, 'cause it's time to make a stand
We're not gonna back down
Culture revolution
Revolution, in your head, on the street move

Take your eyes and see me now
Before I take what you took of me
Lay my head on bloodless hands tonight
Drown in tears the clear but poison wine
Well I need what you owe
Will you pay me back in bandaged covered wrists
Don't you know
The feeling of a cutthroat lover's kiss
Please don't go
Breaking other hearts just like this, just like this
Cause I'm the only one who sees you in the darkness of the night
And even though we're distant, I dream of you despite,
the sickle in between us, that ruins and divides
And even though your gone I'll love you all of my life.

I don't want you to be no slave,
I don't want you to work all day,
But I want you to be true,
And I just wanna make love to you.
Love to you [Repeat: x3]
All I want to do is wash your clothes;
I don't want to keep you indoors.
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me makin' love to you.
Love to you [Repeat: x3]
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk,
I can hear by the way you talk that talk,
I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the lovin' in the whole wide world!
All I want you to do is make your bread!
Just to make sure you're well-fed!
I don't want you sad and blue!
And I just wanna make love to you.
Love to you [Repeat: x3]
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk,
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk,
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I could give you all the lovin' in the whole wide world!
Oh, all I wanna do, all I wanna do is cook your bread!
Just to make sure that you're well-fed!
I don't want you sad and blue,
And I just wanna make love to you.
Love to you [Repeat: x4]

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you

Please just don't play with me My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can
Tears fall, down your face
The taste, is something new
Something that I know
Moving on is, easiest when I am around you.
So bottle up old love,
And throw it out to sea,
Watch it away as you cry
Now a year has past
The seasons go
Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can
Waiting, day to day it goes through
My lips, are sealed for her
My tongue is,
Tied to, a dream of being with you
To settle for less, is not what I prefer
Summer time, the nights they are so long
The leaves fall down, and so do I into
the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me

Hey, go
We've run out of patience
You've run out of time
This scene will not fall victim
To your violence or lies
Your values are nothing
But excuses to start fights
Quit fronting like you're standing
For a moral cause tonight
United as one
We won't stand aside
You tried to fuck with our scene
We're gonna fuck your life
This machine, this machine
This machine, this machine
Kills fucking fascists
Dead, that's right, dead
You don't have to be a racist
To be a Nazi fuck
Your mindless nationalism
Gives you credentials enough
You spew your right wing rhetoric
When we got your attention
You've mistaken the punk scene
For the Republican Convention
No more infiltration
No more right wing lies
You don't belong in our scene
We'll fight you till we die
This machine, this machine
This machine, this machine
Kills fucking fascists
Dead, ahh die

A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground
I don't know who he is
But I think that you do
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Now when I add the sum of you and me
I get confused when I keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man
But not enough for two
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you
Well, you tell me men don't have much intuition
Is that what you really thinking girl
Or are you wishing
Before you wreck your old home
And search for another new
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you

Bo Diddley done had a farm (hey Bo Diddley)
On that farm he had some women (hey Bo Diddley)
Women here, women there (hey Bo Diddley)
Women, women, women everywhere (hey Bo Diddley)
But one little girl lived on a hill (hey Bo Diddley)
She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill (hey Bo Diddley)
One day she decided she'd go for a ride (hey Bo Diddley)
With a pistol and a sword by her side (hey Bo Diddley)
She rolled right up to my front door (hey Bo Diddley)
Knocked an' knocked 'til her fist got sore (hey Bo Diddley)
When she turned and walked away (hey Bo Diddley)
All I could hear my baby say (hey Bo Diddley)
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Saw my baby run across the field (hey Bo Diddley)
Slippin' and slidin' like an automobile (hey Bo Diddley)
Hollerin', my baby got towed away (hey Bo Diddley)
Slipped on from me like a Cadillac-8 (hey Bo Diddley)
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley

Somebody give me a reason why these people live the way they do
They're all forced to watch the failures of their lives
They do everything that they're told as long as they're left alone
But they all seem so happy with their hands tied behind their backs
I can't understand why they care so little for each other
We don't know why they're so numb to the rest of the world
They might regret their present life and other things there before them
They can't explain the anxiety that fills their lives
Their lives, fills their lives, their lives..............
Why do we let them do as they please?
You'd think that they owned our souls
Let's pray that they don't get together and change our minds
There's no use, there's just no place to hide, no place to go
They prey on the weak and the hungry, the rich and the poor
I can't understand why they care so little for each other
We don't know why they're so numb to the rest of the world
They might regret their present life and other things there before them
They can't explain the anxiety that fills their lives
Their lives, fills their lives, their lives..............

In all good faith and sentiment
I can't believe somehow
That I haven't died of grief or something
Since you left this town
I'm all undecorated, cigarettes
And standard white apartment walls
At three AM and four AM
It's impossible to sleep
I'd do anything to hold you
And feel you next to me
But I'm all sore eyes and beasts
At my back door, pulling out their claws
So yes I will take those
Whatever else they give me
If it stops the nightmares
It probably won't kill me
And if I slow it down I'll end up on one of my accusers' knives
So I only stop to tell her that I love her at the red lights
And all in all, I'm wrecked you see
From years of piping down
And piping up about the things
That never mattered anyhow
When you change too much you lose yourself
And sometimes you just can't get them back
And you might be an angel or devil I don't know
But if in fact you are now love
Well I've been there before
I've fallen on my face
And I've been burned so near to death I probably won't live through it
Anyhow
So yes I will take those
Whatever else they give me
If it stops the nightmares
It probably won't kill me
And if I slow it down I'll end up on one of my accusers' knives
So I only stop to tell her that I love her at the red lights

My friends feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me
But my answer yeah to all that use me stuff
Is I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used
Oh you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up
My brother sit me right down and he talked to me
He told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me
And I'm sure he meant well yeah but when our talk was through
I said brother if you only knew you'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up
Oh sometimes yeah it's true you really do abuse me
You get in a crowd of high class people and then you act real rude to me
But oh baby baby baby baby when you love me I can't get enough
I and I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used
Oh you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up
Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're using me
'Cause I sure am using you to do the things you do
Ah ha to do the things you do

One, two, one, two, three, four
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
I feel like I do
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
All the years, I see
(I see)
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
I feel like I do

I'm dying to taste you, I can't deny
Can't get out of my mind
Please let me hold you

Whenever I see you
I just want you around

It feels like bedtime
Constantly thinking of things to do
Places where we can make love

God blessed our love
Even in the mornin' when I rise
I say, God blessed our love
And every mornin' when I rise
I can just see heaven [Incomprehensible] your eyes
It makes me know this is not an everyday love, no, no
We've got something, I'm sure we can be proud of
Oh, we've got so much, show much love
We've got so much, so much trust
Can't you see a halo, a halo?
I can see a halo hovering over us
And oh, I didn't meant it, baby
But God, blessed our love
I have to say it, [Incomprehensible] that
God, oh God, blessed our love
If you've got something to be thankful for
You oughtta just say, hey
God, blessed our love
I'll have to say this evenin'
God, oh God, blessed our love
I swear he did
Let me say, I could just stand up
And tell the world, oh babe
That you're mine, all mine, all mine
Your love is heavenly, desirable
And I just have to say, I like kissin' you
I like, I like, huggin' you
I like squeezin' you, wanting you
Holding you, loving you

No, no, 'cause I know God, God
God is on our side
You see and let me just say that
God, God blessed our love
I have to say that, God, blessed our love

They say the truth's your best defence
I'm bleeding just to pay the rent
And broken dreams mean nothing
When you need something
Just to get you through the year
And now we're moving out
So pack your clothes, your books, your doubt
And bring the piece of paper
That I gave you, back when you were all alone
Letters sent home with no return address
I've got a bag full of old clothes
I've got a bag full of stress
I'm so sorry that I'm leaving
You so little to believe in
'Cause we had a house
With a perfect door and a front room
With the right decor
And I came and wrecked it all
Yes, I came and wrecked it all like I always do
'Cause I didn't think and I poured your life down the kitchen sink
With the dregs of yesterday
And now I'm going to be late
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry that I'm leaving
You so little to believe in
Just tell me, that you're free, of your woes and of me
There's weather more reliable than me
I'm calling base command as the last bit of oxygen runs out but
They're down there softly sleeping
The sun sets over the Pacific region
I'm sitting here hanging in the balance
Just barely in the atmosphere
I'm sitting here hanging in the balance
Just barely in the atmosphere
I'm so sorry that I'm leaving
You so little to believe in
Just tell me, that you're free, of your woes and of me
There's weather more reliable than me
As lonely as Laika
Up there all alone
You miss the atmosphere
The stars are now your home

He'll do just about anything to get that bit of glory
He'll go out with his lads to make that headline story
The normal man in the club have no nees to worry
He'll make his name oh so quick make it in a hurry
Jack Jack Jack the lad they say he's mean
They say he's bad, Jack Jack Jack the lad
Do a shop and make it bold better still rob the old
He'll go in and rob the till and make sure they'll
Never get The Bill
A petty their, always been, never miss a chance you see
Be so hard and very cool never realized that he's just a fool
He's the type to rob your nan of the local paper
Goes out drinking with the boys and brags about his caper
Doesn't realize that he's a clown
I bet he's just one poor man
Due to spend the rest of his life
Wasting in the can

Will I ever get to where I'm going?
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned?
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand
Will I ever get to where I'm going?
If I do, will I know when I'm there?
If the wind blew me in the right direction
Would I even care?
I would
I take a look around
It's evident the scene has changed
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all
And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere
Really fucking fast

In the sharp gust of love
My memory stirred
When time wreathed a rose
A garland of shame
Its thorn my only delight
War torn, afraid to speak
We dare to breathe
Majestic
Imperial
A bridge of sighs
Solitude sails
In a wave of forgiveness
On angels' wings
Reach out your hands
Don't turn your back
Don't walk away
How in the world
Can I wish for this?
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
'Til the last beat
Of my heart
At the close of day
The sunset cloaks
These words in shadowplay
Here and now, long and loud
My heart cries out
And the naked bone of an echo says
Don't walk away
Reach out your hands
I'm just a step away
How in the world
Can I wish for this?
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
'Til the last beat
Of my heart

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day, and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
Along, along, along, along
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do (Know you do)
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

In the evening, I say in the evening
Baby, when the sun goes down
Ah, in the evening, baby, when the sun
When the sun goes down
Baby, when the sun goes down
When your good lover is not around
And when the sun goes down
Last night I lay a-sleeping
I was just thinking, I was just thinking, thinking to myself
Last night, last night, I lay a-sleeping
I was just thinking, thinking to myself
Yeah, and uh, how in the world can somebody
Mistreat you for somebody else
Oh, and when the sun, when the sun goes down
Yeah
The sun rises in the east, way in the east
And it sets out, sets out in the west
Ah, and the sun rises, rises in the east
And it sets out, sets out in the west, yeah, yeah
Now listen
And ain't it hard, ain't it hard to tell
Which one, which one will treat you the best
Oh, oh, when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

I was walking down the street one night
Looking for something to do
When up from the shadows came this horrific fright
And his name was Vincent Van Bow!
And as he drew close, I started to cry
And I slowly backed away
When he grabbed my throat
Stuck his teeth in my neck
And he told me, "Your life will never be the same."
Sittin' around in my coffin waiting for the sun to go down
Sometimes I get up from my sleep and hang around the town
Well you know there ain't much to do
Except for go to Steak 'N Shake
But all I want is a bloody neck
And not some dried-up steak
Down here in Kasey, Indiana there ain't much to do at night
No one around. Where can a vampire get a bite?
I searched the city through and through
And all I find is scum like you
And you are begging to be just like me
I have the power to let you live, or take your life away from you
I'm so hungry. What will I do?
What will I do?
Sittin' around in our coffins waiting for the sun to go down
Well time we get up from our sleep and hang around the town
Well you know there ain't much to do, except for go to Meijer's store
Well that just ain't good enough
I'm longing for something more
Down here in Kasey, Indiana there ain't much to do at night
No one around. Where can a vampire get a bite?
We go downtown to find some gothic punks who hang out every night
They're weak and helpless, but they still put up a fight
After we finish them I ponder on our thought-about my life
It just ain't right
Look over there on the TV screen, it's another vampire movie
A flying vampire with sharp, bloody teeth
The world thinks that's so groovy
Everybody wants to live forever [ooh-oh oh oh oh oh oh]
They all wish that they could be vampires [ooh-oh oh oh oh oh oh]
But I wish that I had something better [ooh-oh oh oh oh oh oh]
For [something something something something something] higher
HEY! Suck!!
[screaming]
No, no. No I don't wanna die
Oh no. Oh no no
Get away. No don't take my life, please
Don't bite me
I don't wanna go
[more screaming]
I searched the city through and through
And all I find is scum like you
and you are begging to be just like me
After I finish you I ponder on my thought-about my life
It just ain't right

Every mornin' runnin' late
Your boss is trying not to hate
You find it hard to concentrate
Thinkin' 'bout this good thing
I try my best to be your man
Use me girl if that's your plan
In the end you'll understand
Happiness is what I bring
[Chorus]
Baby tell me who
Can someone do it better (oh yeah)
Tell me who
Whenever we're together it's like ooh (oh yeah)
You might start feelin' dizzy (oh yeah)
'Cause it's all over now
I keep you in the mood
It's easy girl 'cause I know what to do (oh yeah)
When the phone is ringin' don't disturb the grove (oh yeah)
You might start feelin' dizzy (oh yeah)
'Cause it's all over now
For your touch
Inside I yearn
To love you more
I want to learn
Your body is my first concern
Only when I'm breathin'
I'll get it 'till I hit it right
When it comes to makin' love I'm nice
You won't have to tell me twice
There's no way that you're leavin'
[Chorus]
Ooh baby when the lights go down
I only wait to hear the sound of you
No holdin' back, let it out
That there's no place you'd rather be right now
Ooh baby is ya feelin' good
Is it better than you thought it would
Are you comin' back I think you should
Over and over again
[Chorus]

Well, Saturday night at eight o'clock
I know where I'm gonna go
I'm gonna pick my baby up
And take her to the picture show
Ev'rybody in the neighborhood
Is dressin' up to be there too
And we're gonna have a ball
Just like we always do
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony?
Well, there's technicolor and cinemascope
A cast out a Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's alway lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sittin' by my side
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony?
Ah Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony?
Ah Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're huggin' with your baby
In the last row in the balcony?
Yeah, Saturday night at the movies

You know every now and then it's just nice
To do it with me
You know what I mean?
There's a dream I keep dreamin'
Somehow it just won't seem to go away
Lord, if I can make, make someone
Else believe it
It just might come true someday, oh
Imagine people lovin' people, well well
No sign of hatred in their eyes
Where children grow up
Without hunger or sorrow
I'd like to live, live in a world where no one cries
Oh, just let me live in a world where no one cries
Oh, it's just a dream, just a dream to me
Oh, one day, one day it just might become a reality
Oh, the people in the world, if they can only see
What would this world be like
If everyone were singin' in the same key to me, that's harmony
And there are those, who say I am foolish
To think things that could never never be
Oh, how can they expect to reach out, reach out to somethin'
That their mind refuse to see, ooh
Let me live, let me live in a world where no one cries
Just let me live in a world where no one cries
No matter where I, road will lead me
Always keep the dream, keep the dream alive
But I can wake up, you find that I am livin'
Livin' in a world
Livin' in a world where no one cries
Just let me live
Live in a world where no one cries
Everyday, everyday would be like Sunday
Oh yes, it will
I know, I know, I know, I know, I will
Listen, let me tell you my story
Why can't we?
Why can't we, we just respect each other
Without yeah

(1, 2, 3, 4)
Ooooh

It's twenty five miles from home,
Girl, my feet are hurting mighty bad.
Now I've been walking a three day, two lonely nights.
You know that I'm mighty mad,
But I got a woman waiting for me;
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile.
You see, she's got the kind of lovin' and a kissing
A make a man go stone wild,
So I got to keep on walkin'.
I got to walk on, oh, ho, ho.
I, I, I, I'm so tired ,
But I just can't lose my stride.
I got fifteen miles to go now,
And I can hear my baby calling my name.
It's as if, as though, I'm standing at her front door.
I can hear that doggone plain.
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby,
And hold her in my arms.
Now, when I kiss her lips,
I turn a back over, flip, and I'll forget these feet of mine.
I got to keep on walkin'.
I got to walk on, oh, ho, ho.
I, I, I, I, I'm so tired, but I just can't lose my stride.
Walk on, let me tell you, ya'll, I, I, I, I, I, I'm so tired,
But I just can't lose my stride .
Come on feet, don't fail me now.
I got ten more miles to go.
I got nine, eight, seven, six, eight, six...
I got a five more miles to go.
Now over the hill, just around the bend.
Huh, although my feet are tired, I can't lose my stride;
I got to get to my baby again.

Well she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running wild
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams and a fairy tale
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding the wind
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright she says...it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything
Fly on little wing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly on little wing

Mustang Sally
Guess you better slow that Mustang down
Mustang Sally, now baby
Guess you better slow that Mustang down
You've been running all over town
Ooh, I guess you gotta put your flat feet on the ground
Spoken: "Sing it to me one more time girls."
-Chorus-
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
Tell you, one of these early mornings
I'm gonna be wiping those weepin' eyes, yeah
I brought you a brand new Mustang [ride]
It was a nineteen sixty five
Now you comin' around to signify a woman
Girl, you won't, you won't let me ride
Mustang Sally, now baby [Sally, now baby]
Guess you better slow that Mustang down [down], alright
You've been running all over town
Oh, I guess you gotta put your flat feet on the ground
Spoken: "Oh yeah, baby, you gotta put your flat feet"
-Chorus-
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride], ah yeah
All you wanna do is ride around Sally [Ride, Sally, ride]
One of these early mornings
I'm gonna be wiping those weepin' eyes, yeah
Spoken: "Oh yeah, baby, come on, boys"
Those weepin' eyes, oh yeah, those weepin' eyes
Those weepin' eyes, yeah, yeah, yeah, those weepin' eyes
Those weepin' eyes
Oh, those weepin' eyes
yeah, yeah, yeah, hey yeah.

Here's your letter
And in each line I'll write your love away
And you know, say it's better
But sometimes what is honest I can't say
And it's true
I think it's better than before
When I gave you love, you wanted more
There's the door
This is useless
How can I explain what needs no words?
But you know now you'll lose this
To what's been done you're praying for the words
But it's you and I guess it's better than before
(I guess it's better than before)
When I gave you love you wanted more
(When I gave you love you wanted more)
There's the door 'cause I'm on the floor
There's your letter
When you're done I'm saying it once more
'Cause it's true
And I guess it's better than before
(I guess it's better than before)
When I gave you love, you found some more
(When I gave you love, you found some more)
Cause it's you
And I guess it's better than before
(I guess it's better than before)
When I gave you love, you wanted more
(When I gave you love, you wanted more)
There's the door 'cause I'm on the floor
And there's the door and I'm on the floor

Theyre just words, they aint worth nothing
Cloud your head and push your buttons
And watch how they just disappear
When were far away from here
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Star-crossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time
Oh who put all those cares inside your head
You cant live your life on your deathbed
And its been such a lovely day
Lets not let it end this way
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Star-crossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time
Like sisters and brothers we lean on each other
Like sweethearts carved on a headstone
Oh why even bother, itll be here tomorrow
Its not worth it sleeping alone
And look at you and me still here together
There is no one knows you better
And weve come such a long long way
Lets put it off for one more day
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Star-crossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time

She's gone away, but still they stay together
People call me crazy, crazy
My thoughts progress, I think about forever
My mind tells me maybe, maybe
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah
Cross my t's and dot my I's
Better say hello, don't you dare say goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you forever and today
Two weeks go by, seems like it's been the weather
The rain falls down she's crying, crying
My thoughts progress, she thinks about forever
Their hearts are bound lying, lying
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah
Cross my t's and dot my I's
Better say hello, I'm gonna wave goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you forever and today
All the heartache all the pain
All the words you said in vain
And I'll never be the same
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah
Cross my t's and dot my I's
Better say hello, I'm gonna wave goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you forever and today
Forever and today [Repeat: x 2]
P.S. I love you forever and today

Oh, lay lay lay lay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, hey hey
I thought that love would conquer all
That nothing could break my fall
The moment you left my side, oh baby
And now there's nothing left to say
Ever since you went away
I've been yearning for you deep inside
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how, can I go on, can I go on
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
If I had only had a clue
That I'd end up losing you
I might of held on to my heart, oh girl
Taking for granted you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Has torn my world apart
And I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how, can I go on, can I go on
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think, think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how, can I go on, can I go on
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours
Mine and yours
Will I ever get over cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
After the love is gone
I must go on
I gotta be strong
After the love is gone
I can't believe it, but she's gone
But I gotta be strong
I gotta gotta gotta be, gotta gotta gotta be
Gotta gotta gotta be strong
Oh, after the love is gone

I'm your mama, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor, when in need
Want some coke, have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Ain't I clean, bad machine
Super cool, super mean
Feelin' good, for the man
Superfly, here I stand
Secret stash, heavy bread
Baddest bitches, in the bed
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Solid life, of crime
A man of odd circumstance
A victim of ghetto demands
Feed me money for style
And I'll let you trip for a while
Insecure from the past
How long can a good thing last
Woohoo, no
Got to be mellow, y'all
Gotta get mellow now
Pusherman gettin' mellow y'all
Heavy mind, every sign
Makin' money all the time
My LD, and just me
For all junkies to see
Ghetto prince is my thing
Makin' love's how I swing
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Two bags please
For a generous fee
Make you world
What you want it to be
Got a woman I love desperately
Wanna give her something better than me
Been told I can't be nothin' else
Just a hustler in spite of myself
I know I can brake it
This life just don't make it
Lord, lord
Got to get mellow now
Gotta be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow now
I'm your mama, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor, when in need
Want some coke, have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman

I just got back to routine, it goes from day to day,
I've got this sneaky feeling, gets closer as we play,
After months and months of planning, hard work to hit the road,
No sense of "security" you get when you're at home,
[Chorus]
And just for you, there is a calendar, not just a need for the time
But just 'cause you're on my mind,
It's made of days, this simple calendar,
But it feels like years going by, where do I cry
I've rearranged my whole life, such things are hard for two,
But still the music keeps me going and my heart is set on you,
We see so many faces, do cities look the same,
I'll take this voyage anyway, and hope someday you'll go

Preacher is preaching
How you should live
Instead of teaching
With the love they give
They ask for money
In the name of the Lord
And they line their pockets; keep coming back for more
Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
What they feed you
Strive to believe
Giving you just enough to make you needy
By the time you wake up they're already gone
Looking for the next fool to come along
Dragging you down.
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
Shatters your world
Spoiling your mind
Keeping your heart
Prayer divine
Dragging you down
Chipping away
Misleading you all with the things they say
Shatters your heart
Foiling your mind
Prayer divine

Oh what a night, to love you dear
Oh what a night, to hold you near
Oh what a night, to squeeze you dear,
that's why I love you so
Oh what a night, to love you dear
Oh what a night, to hold you dear
Oh what a night, to kiss you dear,
That's why I love you so
I won't forget all those things you have told to me
The craze in my heart won't let me forget your love
Oh what a night, to love you dear
Oh what a night, to hold you near
Oh what a night, to squeeze you dear
That's why I love you so
Oh what a night, to love you dear
Oh what a night, to want you dear
Oh what a night to kiss you dear
That's why I love you so

She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning,
her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,
and destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win.
She asked me name my foe then. I said the need within some men
to fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or god.
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,
so eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,
so easy to begin and yet impossible to end.
For she the mother of all men had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay.
"Oh lady lend your hand," I cried, "Oh let me rest here at your side."
"Have faith and trust in me," she said and filled my heart with life.
There is no strength in numbers. I've no such misconceptions.
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away.

I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

Expect your life for free, decisions in your hands
You want too much from me; I'll help you if I can
Save me
The war has just begun
Together we are strong
Save me, save me
The tension in your words are written in the sand
There is no one left to serve to carry out your plans
You sacrificed your son, you fought for useless land
You are the Chosen Ones, or can't you see that?
Refuse to fight for me, submit to your demands
Is that what you believe? Is that your final stand?
Save me!
The tension in your words are written in the sand
There is no one left to serve to carry out your plans
You sacrificed our sons, you fought for useless land
You are the Chosen Ones! Or can't you see that?
The tension in our world, is wringing from your hands
There is no one left to serve, to fuck up all our plans
You sacrificed your sons, you fought for useless land
You are the Chosen Ones
Or can't you see that
Save me!

See those kids, so young and free
I guess that's how it use ta be
So caught up in themselves, they just don't see
But standing hard gives us this right
To put up walls and to prove our might
And faster, faster must the music go
Farewell to seven years
We bid a fond so long
To seven years
Why'd it take so long?
They're waitin' for old times again
If they support, they'll understand
Our message calls for unity not rage
We see so many ways
To vent the anger in our troubled hearts
Without using it to smash up someone else
Farewell to seven years
We bid a fond so long
To seven years
Why'd it take so long?
And it takes so long

Huh, you know life is funny when you look at it
Everybody wants love
But everybody's afraid of love
You know, I'm a true believer
If you get anything out of life
You got to put up with the toil and strife
Ooh You're pushin' my love
A little bit too far
I don't think you know
I don't think you know how blest you are
And your friend Annie May tell you all she see
Have you, ever thought she was tryin' to get close to me
Think it over, think it over, girl, think it over
That's the way I feel about 'cha
That's the way I feel about 'cha
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I know you've been hurt and so have many others too
But that's the sacrifice that life put you thru
Put you thru, put you thru
Trust in me, my dear, have no fear
You don't know but God might have sent me here, sent me here
Think it over, think it over, girl, think it over
That's the way I feel about 'cha
(Any of us can leave for a long adventure)
That's the way I feel about 'cha
Don't take my love as a sign of weakness
Check into the situation, girl
Dig a little deeper
Think it over, think it over, girl, think it over
That's the way I feel about 'cha
That's the way I feel about 'cha

You left me here to suffer
You left me dying alone
It's only made me stronger
Your day - your day will surely come
But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitterness and filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me?
You will feel the pain you caused me
Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
I'm drowning in my mysery
Because of you I lost my sanity
Because of you I will never love again
Because of you I will never love again
But now I lay I wait
But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitterness and filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me?
You will feel the pain you caused me
Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
I'm drowning in my misery
Because of you I lost my sanity
Haunted by memories of a love
That left me filled with pain
I will never love again
I replaced your love with hate
Never love again

Mary had a little baby,
Born in bethlehem
Everytime the little baby cried
She rocked him in a weary land
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that
Oh, she rocked
Oh, she rocked and rocked
She rocked him in a weary land
Rocking,rocking
He was born in a lowly manager
'cause there was found no room in the inn
Everytime the little baby cried
She rocked him in a weary land
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that
Oh, she rocked
Oh, she rocked and rocked
She rocked him in a weary
There were shepherds abiding in the field
Keeping watch o'er the flock by night
Unto you a babe was born this day
Said the angel of the lord to the shepherds in the field
Angels call him christ the lord
But I call my jesus king emmanuel
Everytime the little baby cried
She rocked him in a weary land
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that rockin' for the world
Ain't that
Oh, she rocked
Oh, she rocked and rocked
She rocked him in a weary

Summer night in Harlem,
Man it's really hot!
Well it's too hot to sleep
And too hot to eat.
I don't care if I die or not!
Winter night in Harlem,
Oh oh radiator won't get hot,
And that mean ole landlord
He don't care if I freeze to death or not!
Saturday night in Harlem,
Ahh every thing's alright.
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing,
The parties are out of sight.
Sunday morning here in Harlem
Now every body's all dressed up.
The heathen folk just getting home from the party
And the good folk just got up.
Our crooked delegation
Wants a donation
To send the preacher to the holy land
Hey hey lord honey don't give your money
To that lying, cheating man..

Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Yes, I'll give her everything she needs
'Cause I am her driving wheel
Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she would be back early Friday mornin'
Or laid over Saturday afternoon
Yes, every time she walk
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, when my baby walk down the street
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, the women all hate her
But man, she's alright with me
Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
I want the whole world to know
That I am my baby's driving wheel

Verse 1: Today I met an angel, and I know for sure,
I was broken hearted and she found the cure.
Quit looking for love,then it will be found.
Never believed it, until you came around.
Chorus: And I know that im not much,
but this I promise you,
that I will always love you with a heart that's true.
And I know this sounds like just another tune,
but if you asked me I'd bring you the moon.
Verse 2: I love the way it feels to have you next to me,
looking in my eyes, smiling gently.
My heart always stops,when you reach out for my hand
if tomorrow never found me, I would die a happy man
Chorus:1X

Its time to punch the clock
To get back on the bus
And go back to our so-called 'home'
This situation stinks
Of familiarity
Mixed up with fear of the unknown
Let's go run away
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
Emotionally drained
Don't remember every name
Of every person that I meet
We're all so hard to please
Expectations so heavy
And the television makes me sad
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
And now I try to be your best friend
Id die to be your best friend
But its all up to you

Let's take it all away
Replace it with everything that we have made
Let's start over again
I'm putting pen to page
And right now I'm all clichés
But words will fade try to keep me awake
[Chorus:]
And I know
This is it
This is greater than anything
Let's take slow
It's too late
This is greater than anything
Let's have it all our way
Replace it with everything that we have made
We're counting the days
And chasing the nights away
I'll leave this place with a smile on my face
[Chorus x2]
You give me more than you could know
You set me free don't let me go
[Chorus x3]

Sometimes I feel so alone baby girl
I call your heart but there's no one at home
Taking a toll on my pride
I'm reaching out but there's no one inside
You know it doesn't feel right
When I look in your eyes
I know love is blind but the heart doesn't lie
I'll ask one more time
Maybe this time you'll try
So tell me girl what's deep in your heart
Girl I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
Girl I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
I spend like all of my day, baby
Trying to sense out just how things got this way
I thought that we were in love
But I swear right now I don't know what you want, babe
I make sure that I give you quality time
But lately I feel you're not home by design
But still I'm gonna try to give you the love of my life
In hopes that you, that you will open up your heart, baby
Girl I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
Girl I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
Sometimes I'm not sure that
That I'm all you got
Sometimes I'm not sure you love me or not, baby
Just one thing that I'm certain of
Girl I care for you
And the one thing that I want is that you care for me too
Girl I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
Girl I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care about you
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,baby, babe, yeah
Yeah, oh yeah, ooooh
I care for you, babe

Everybody wants to laugh
Ah, but nobody wants to cry
I say everybody wants to laugh
But nobody wants to cry
Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody want to hear the truth
But yet, everybody wants to tell a lie
I say everybody wants to hear the truth
But still they all want to tell a lie
Oh everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody want to know the reason
Without even askin' why
Oh, everybody want to know the reason
Oh, without even askin' why
You know everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die

I'll never forget when we started out
The beat of the drum
A face in the crowd
It's better this way, it's better this way
How far we've come, now not a soul can change
Remember the road running under our feet
We'd shoot for the stars but we'd aim at the trees
It's better this way, it's better this way
Gambling with life, it was our turn to play
It's time, only when you look forward can you see behind
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
Every trial and every test
We'd drive to the east and we'd fly to the west
Just running away, just running away
We can't be different cause they're all the same
Every night that we'd ever start, and every beat of every heart
Is running away, just running away
Catching our breath at the end we could say
It's time, only when you look forward could you see behind
Every taste we could get was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment we let go of life
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling wasn't hard
We lost ourselves to find our somewhere down the line this time
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling wasn't hard
We lost ourselves to find our somewhere down the line this time
For some it's a god, for me it's a fact
We'd make a mistake and try to take 'em all back
It's better this way, it's better this way
Out of the grind and then into the grave
It's time, it's time, only when you look forward could you see behind
Every taste we could get was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment we let go of life
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride
We bought the ticket so we'll take the ride

We started out simple friends
That kind of friendship never ends, no baby
But we were fortunate to care enough
We knew just where we stood
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray
Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you like I do
Where, where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do
What kind of friends could we have been
If we had kept the feelings in
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love
You were thinkin' that our love was gonna stray
Oh tell me
Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you baby
The way that I do, now baby
Where, where will you go, where will you go
And tell me who is gonna love
I want to know who is gonna love
I need to know who's gonna love
Who's gonna love, who, who, who, oh
Where, where will you go, baby
Who's gonna love you baby, tell me
Who's gonna care for you baby
Who's gonna be there for you baby
Who's gonna love you like you need to be loved
Oh where will you go, baby
And who's gonna love you like I do
Oh I want to know I want to know I want to know
Like I do

When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind
My eyes was full of tears since she left me behind
I pass a million peopleI can't tell who I meet
I pass a million peopleI can't tell who I meet
My eyes are full of tears, where can my baby be?
I went to see a gypsy to get my fortune read
I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read
My head hung in sorrow when she said what she said
When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

Some fellas look at the eyes
Some fellas look at the nose
Some fellas look at the size
Some fellas look at the clothes
I don't care if her eyes are red
I don't care if her nose is long
I don't care if she's underfed
I don't care if her clothes are worn
First I look at the purse!
Some fellas like the smiles they wear
Some fellas like the legs that's all
Some fellas like the style of their hair
Want their waist to be small.
I don't care if their legs are thin
I don't care if their teeth are big
I don't care if their hair's a wig
Why waste time lookin' at the waistline?
First I look at the purse!
A woman can be fat as can be,
kisses sweet as honey
But that don't mean a thing to me
If you ain't got no money
If the purse is fat, that's where it's at.
Some fellas like the way they walk
The way they swing and sway
Some fellas like the way they talk
Dig the things they say.
I don't care if they wobble like a
or talk with a lisp
I still think I'm a good lover
if the dollar bills are crisp
First I look at the purse!
First I look at the purse!
First I look at the purse!
First I look at the purse!
I don't care if you got yourself a wrap
all I want is your pretty green cash
Bought me a suit, bought me a car
Want me to look like a Hollywood star
Money, (Money!) I want money (Money!)
Baby, ain't no "why", baby (Money!)
I need money!
First I look at the purse!
First I look at the purse!
First I look at the purse!
First I look at the purse!

Every thing's simple, ha, it's bound to catch on quick
And if you hang around, hang around, you know you can't resist
I'm a simple man livin' everyday life, I work a hard job every night
And I come home straight to my wife, bring her lot of pay
Don't mind working everyday, it's my right
Ah, uh, you see, I don't put down a man, I work for better hand
'Cause I know I'm doin' the best I can
I'm a simple man, everyday people, alright
Now listen to me, when it come to my music, music, music, music
Got to be simple but funky, I got to, I got to
Everybody get down, everybody get down, got to, got to
Got to move if the feelin' doesn't groove
Now listen to me, you have got to get a thing, yeah
That you like to do, if you do me, good lord, I'm gonna do you
Hang on in there, hang on in there, we'd only wanna [Incomprehensible]
But we stand just as tall and I have started too late
They're going out and havin' a ball
Everyday people, everyday people, got to, got to, got to, my
Like if a roof caved in you might as well forget it
I take like for what it is, I wanna hear you dig it
I don't believe in volumes, I don't believe in deals
I don't put down a man, I don't put down a man for the way he feels
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
There's somethin' that you gonna do but you won't do
Try to understand me, I'm tryin' to understand you, yeah
Get on down, get on, get on, get on, get on, get on down
Got to, got to, got to, got to, tease me, got to, please me
Baby, good lord, baby
Ah, we can work it out, ah, we can work it out without a doubt
Ah, we can work it out, ah, we can work it out
And lets get the thing together and lets get the thing together
Hang on in there, hang on in there

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But your the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like
A natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful, of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like
A natural woman
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be, close to you
You make me feel so alive
You make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like
A natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel

For every time you had to go asleep alone.
For every time I tried to rush you off the phone.
For every time I said something to make you cry.
Now that all is said and done, I can't deny.
I'm so sorry for anything I might have done.
And I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt the only one,
And I'm sorry, the best laid plans sometimes fall through,
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
For every time I lied right to your face,
And you knew it.
For all the wasted time that we cannot replace.
For every time that a discussion turned into an argument, we'd fight.
Hey, how I wish that I could have it back tonight.
I'm so sorry for anything I might have done.
And I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt the only one,
And I'm sorry, the best laid plans sometimes fall through,
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
To try and count your tears, would be like standing in the rain.
The weather's been bad, for year ¡ for that I'll gladly take the blame.
Now our two separate lives will never ever be the same,
But I hope that you can forgive someday.
I'm so sorry for anything I might have done.
And I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt the only one,
And I'm sorry, the best laid plans sometimes fall through,
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.
For anything that I might've done, I apologize to you.

Now that you're here with me,
I want to keep you free,
To do the things that you want to do,
The joy in life is loving you,
But now the day has come,
To let you know where I'm coming from,
The best of my years will go to you,
It's the only thing that I can do,
But these things don't come overnight,
Lovin' you baby, I think I'm right.
Let me say before I forget,
Lovin' you baby, it's where it's at yeah
Ya baby, look what you done for me,
Ya baby, you set my heart free,
Oh but I feel, yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel yeah
Sometimes I want to leave, but then I say,
It wouldn't make sense at all,
Anyway, forgive me baby,
If I do wrong,
I haven't been a true man for so long,
But let me say before I forget,
Lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, yeah
Ya baby, look what you done for me,
Ya baby, you set my heart free,
Baby, do you want to, do the thing that you oughta,
You've been very good for me,
And that's a fact, I say,
Ya baby, look what you done for me,
Ya yeah you set my heart free, yeh
Oh, no matter,
What you done for me,
I got the feelin' that it's gonna,
Ya, look what you done for me
Baby, baby, you set my heart free

A wall of denial, is fallin' down
Whoa it's fallin' so hard, down to the ground
Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears
But this wall of denial was just built on fear
We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies
Dressed them, amused them pullin' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them, to keep from letting them go
All the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
We're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Down to the ground
Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure
A smile, a kiss, a little baby's laughter
It makes no difference if we run away in fear
The little things in life, hold us so near
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
Never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Yeah this wall of denial must tumble down
Down to the ground

Hey
I heard you say you don't feel right
Somethin' must've changed inside
She said, I still love the bands and the boy down the street
But everybody else gives me the creeps
And there's a hole in you now
Like the windshield was taken out
And everybody's hurt, and mine ain't the worst
But it's mine and I'm feelin' it now
Sometimes I think it's haunted inside this house
And I hear ya cryin' over the phone
"Where have all the good times gone?"
Downing the glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs they don't write anymore
(Hey hey hey) It's all right, I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
(Hey hey hey) "Oh my, my, my, she says, I don't mind
I'm just so tired of the empty sheets I sleep beside
Heard you say it's gone all wrong, since when did the days and the nights get so long?
She said, I still miss the scene and the dying breed, but now I'd settle for some company
And there were things that I did, just so I could feel anything
But somewhere along, something went off, and I woke up with blood on my lips
And yeah, and there were nights I just did whatever I liked
And now I hear ya cryin' over the phone
Where have all the good times gone?
Downing the glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs they don't write anymore
But hey hey hey, it's all right, I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
Oh my,my, my, she said, I don't mind, I'm just so tired of the empty sheets I sleep beside
And now I hear ya cryin' over the phone
Where have all the good times gone?
Downing the glass of shouting matches
Lost in the songs you don't write anymore
But hey hey hey
It's all right, I ain't tryin' to bring you down tonight
And oh my, my, my, she said, I don't mind
'Cause maybe someday they're gonna love me back to life
(See my baby, sweet Rosemary)
My name is Rosemary
(See my baby, sweet Rosemary)
You'd be lucky to meet me
(See my baby, sweet Rosemary)
My name is Rosemary
(See my baby, sweet Rosemary)
Yeah, you'd be lucky if you get to hold me
My name is Rosemary, and you'd be lucky to meet me

Whatever this becomes
Whatever words I say
We are the fortunate ones...
And when the days are done
I won't forget
All I see in you and me
Is a light in the dark of humanity
And when the days are done
I won't forget
Timid steps - come walk with me
And with your useless words
Come talk to me
There are broken hearts
Now on your stereo
But the broken beats are just too slow
You'll cry - it doesn't change a thing
Kill the lights - and let the rain fall
Recall - the memories
Of yesterdays and better ways
And know - the innocence is gone...
Move on - from this day on
We'll never be the same...
The saddest songs
Make sense to me...
So with your sunken eyes
Come look for me
Two hour drives
Are two hours alone
But two hour drives
Are better than home
You'll die - it doesn't change a thing
You will - kill the lights
And let the rain fall - recall
The memories of yesterdays
And better ways
And know - the innocence is gone...
Move on - from this day on
We'll never be the same...
Faster words - and faster kids
Faster songs - and faster ends
The one thing that's stayed the same...
I've lived through days
I've lived through nights
I've had my loves
I've had my fights
You gotta know - you have my heart

And on a Monday, I'm gonna love ya
And on a Tuesday, I'm gonna hug ya
And on a Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, gonna love ya
I work for you baby, work my hand to the bone
Care for you, baby, till the cows come home
Do for you, baby, for the love that I seek
Slave for you, baby, every day of the week
(And on a Monday) scrub your dirty floor
(On a Tuesday) I do a whole lot more

featuring justin timberlake
When I was younger, I never went too far
Held my feelings, I never even wanted to start
Til when I met you, I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart
When you talk. I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
When I'm not with you, wherever you are
Baby,I'm counting the moments til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me every night, every day
When you talk, I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
My world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
Baby girl, I need you here by my side
And If you're there everything will be alright
Cause this is the time for us (This is the time)
Baby, be mine! (Baby be mine)
And you're the kind of girl I think of (I think about)
And you're the kind of girl I dream about (The kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind of girl (repeat)

There's something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, baby
By the way you look at me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Oh, and it bring misery
Please, please, don't try to tell me
I think, I, I understand
No, no, don't try to tell me, baby
'Cause I think, I, I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Well, I'll do, baby, I'll do the best I can
You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone
And you know that someone don't love you
It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know
That the someone that you're in love with
Is in love with your best friend
And I'll tell you, when someone else is rocking you
Rocking your cradle, you know, better
Than you can rock your cradle yourself
Then there's only one thing for you to do
You just pack your clothes turn around
And slowly walk out of the door
Look over your left shoulder as you go out
Then you hang your head and you say
Oh please don't try to tell me
Uh huh, I think, I understand
No, no, no, no please don't try to tell me
Because you think, you think I understand
Oh you want me to try, to try to forget you, baby
And I'll tell you, I'll do the best I can
You know after you have done all you could do
And you can't take no more, then you go downtown
You get your big baseball bat
And you come back on the scene
Where they both are still together
And then you just go and kick down the door
Now as you kick down the door you just start
Beating the hell of everybody that you can see
Everybody that comes through the door
And just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try
To forgive her, then out comes another one of your friends
And that really blows your mind so you go and think about
You say to yourself, baby I realize I've done wrong
But please forgive me and with a smirky smile on her face
Then she look up at you and she say
If you ever think about me
(Oh I think about you, baby)
If you ever change your mind
(Oh you're staying on my mind, baby)
If you ever think about me
(Oh I think, I think about you all the time)
And if I ever cross your mind
(You stay on my mind)
Well, you know, you know
You know I'm yours
And I know, I know you got to be mine
(Yeah)
There's something on your mind, be
I can tell by the way you look at me
(Oh, there's something, on my mind, baby)
There is something on your mind
(Oh can you tell, there's something on my mind)
By the way you look at me
(Oh the way I look at you, you look good to me)
And what you're thinking brings happiness
(Yes, baby)
Oh and it can bring misery
(Yes, all right)

Lost in a full time fantasy
I used to walk around lookin' for someone
Someone, someone will love me
Oh why, I thought that dreams were out of reach for me?
And my heart had seized to beat
Then you came, you came and you touched me
Now I am feelin' my heart beat again
And I feel I could win this time
Falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beating so fast
And I feel it could last with you
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Caught in a mystic reality
That's the way I felt that moment I laid eyes on your soul
And in a while you became the fire
That kissed me warm from the cold
The only one I wanna hold
Can't you see you make love me so much more?
And I am feelin' my heart beat again
Don't have to pretend no more
Falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beat so fast
Feel it could last with you
You got me falling in love again
Falling in love again
Right now, right now
I am feelin' my heart beat again
I feel I could win this time
'Cause you got me falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beat so fast
I feel it heal at last with you
'Cause I am falling in love again
Falling in love again

Man you've gotta problem, who made you fuckin' king
A macho pig with nothing in your head.
No girls around you, their place is not at gigs,
Don't want 'em on the dance floor 'cos they're weak.
A woman's place, the kitchen, on her back,
It's time to change that attitude, and quick.
(Chorus)
Showing us your phobias, you're scared to see 'em think,
You'd rather dress 'em up in pretty lace,
All nice and colored pink.
You feel so fucking threatened,
When they stand out in front,
A stupid, passive piece of meat is all you really want
But it's:
Not just boys' fun (x4)
There's girls who put out fanzines, others put on shows,
Yet they're not allowed to get out on the floor.
Some make the music, well that you can accept.
Hell, maybe live you'll get some tits and ass
You fucking moron, your brains have run amuck,
A girl's only lot in life is not to fuck!
(Repeat Chorus)

Well, you know you took my heart
And you broke it apart
Why did our love baby, yeah yeah
Have to ever start
You know you took my love, threw it away
You gonna want, my love someday
Well a bye bye baby
(Bye bye bye)
Well I thought your love
Was oh so true
And you lured me baby, yeah
Started loving you
You know you took my love, threw it away
You gonna want, my love someday
Well a bye bye baby
(Bye bye bye)
Well, your love was
Sweeter than
Any I know
So don't come back
Running
Knockin' on my front door
Well you said that I
Was your only girl
And there was no others, yeah
In this whole wide world
You know you took my love, threw it away
You gonna want, my love someday
Well a bye bye baby
(Bye bye bye)
Well, your love was
Sweeter than
Any I know
So don't come back
Running
Knockin' on my front door
Well you said that I
Was your only girl
And there was no others, yeah
In this whole wide world
You know you took my love, threw it away
You gonna want, my love someday
Well a bye bye baby
(bye bye baby)
Whoah, bye bye baby
(Bye bye baby)
Bye, I don't want you know more
(Bye bye bye)
Bye, bye baby
(Bye bye baby, bye bye)
Whooo, don't need your love, yeah yeah
(Bye bye baby, bye bye)
I don't want you baby, whoooo
(Bye bye baby, bye bye)
Bye bye baby, yeah
(Bye bye baby, bye bye)
Bye bye baby, ohh
(Bye bye baby, bye bye)

Dear Spike,
I can tell that your company cares about its customers
And that's why I wrote this letter
To express my thanks to you in this endeavor
Today I got my stuff that I ordered long ago
And I wanted you to know that I also got the note
And now if you don't mind, I'd like to take some time
I hope you understand this letter from a grateful fan
I had a dream, a very strange dream
Where I was waiting for my package
Then up through the clouds
I saw this bus, a flying bus,
It was coming towards me
It hovered above, I saw my order
Floating down and softly touched ground
Then I saw Spike, he was flying the bus
He smiled and waved as the bus flew away
I just wanna let you know
How grateful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know you didn't forget me
I had a dream, a very strange dream,
Where I was waiting for my package.
Then up through the clouds
I saw this bus, a flying bus
It was coming towards me
It hovered above, and I saw my order
Floating down and softly touched ground
Then I saw Spike he was flying the bus
He smiled and waved as the bus flew away.
I just want to let you know
How thankful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know that you didn't forget me.
You didn't forget me, Spike
I wrote you a letter
I ordered a T-shirt and a Cadet Package
It Didn't come for a long time
You sent me a letter and said,
"It's on its way!"
I just want to let you know
How thankful I am to you
I appreciate all the hard work
And kindness you put into
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
What a task it must have been
Dear Spike
Dear Spike
I'm so glad to know that you didn't forget about me.

At the dark end of the street
that is where we always meet
hiding in shadows where we don't belong
living in darkness, to hide alone
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me
I know a time has gonna take it's toll
we have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, our love keeps going on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me
They gonna find us, they gonna find us
They gonna find us love someday
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me
When the daylight all goes around
And by chance we're both down the town
Please meet, just walk, walk on by
Oh, darling, please don't you cry
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me

I'm consumed by the idol of you
In my head i wish i never knew
Twists and turns but i cant let it go
Still I wonder why did i have to know
Oh, oh
Running through the details
Oh, oh
Tried to quit but I failed
Oh, oh
I attempt to exhale
I take a deep breath in
And now i gotta let it go, oh
This is haunting me so, oh
Watch it cast a shadow
Waste my life, let it go
Why did i have to know
(I'm left with)
All the mess that it made
(Erase it)
How can i be saved
Twists and turns but i cant let it go
Still I wonder why did i have to know
Oh, oh
Running through the details
Oh, oh
Tried to quit but I failed
Oh, oh
I attempt to exhale
I take a deep breath in
And now i gotta let it go, oh
This is haunting me so, oh
Watch it cast a shadow
Waste my life, let it go
Why did i have to know
Why did i have to know
Why did i...
Oh, oh
Running through the details
Oh, oh
Tried to quit but I failed
Oh, oh
I attempt to exhale
I take a deep breath in
And now i gotta let it go, oh
This is haunting me so, oh
Watch it cast a shadow
Waste my life, let it go
Why did i have to know

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than
Mr. Prez in his big White House
Listen he says we're comin' out
Infiltration-we're numbin' your minds
Concentration-we've done time
[repeat chorus]
Over there the Queen she says
Let's stamp them out and dry
Those tears
Saturation-we want in taxes
Flagelation-we've got gashes
[repeat chorus]
In the cold, the czars claimin'
Just protectin', rockets aimin'
Alteration-the word is changin'
Observation-we want action
[repeat chorus]
I the Emperor proclaim
Us the masters we rule the game
Inclination-somethin' to dream on
Deprivation-we are sons
[repeat chorus]

Time does tell
That even if they say so
She'd be the one that would know
That I did do what I've done
And I, I wouldn't call it cheating
I'd just say I was leading her on
Why walk while I run a-way
You- you ask me what went wrong
Me- I'll write you this last song
Please- just tell me one way we can win
One- more thing before I go
Two- the one who loves me so
Three- don't make me count to three again
Happy endings
Just what did you do, If you're a dream then come true
Stop pretending
That what you mean isn't what you say
Hopeful dreaming,
Of times before the pain, wishing it was still the same
Loving, leaving
Round and round and round we go again
Walks a-lone, have often lead to thinking
My love for you is sinking to what seems an all time low
Or high, the limits' never ending,
And don't you know I'm sending
There's no venture I won't go
For you

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Early in the morning
My friends already calling
Ready for a party
They're just getting started
Wouldn't miss it for a moment
My heart's already stolen
Heard he's gonna be there
To miss it wouldn't be fair
No, no, no, no, no, no
When a woman wants her man
She'll catch him any way she can

Driving down the highway
Roberta, Donnie Hathaway, yeah yeah
Playing on the airwaves
As we're making our way
We pull up to a red light
Check the mirror for the last time (for the last time)
I know I'm looking just fine and I feel all right
'cause I know I'm gonna party tonight, yeah, baby
When a woman wants her man
She'll catch him any way she can

Walking through the party
With all my girls behind me, yeah, yeah
Suddenly I saw him
My heart it started jumping (and jumping and jumping and jumping)
Then he led me to the dance floor
Then he held me closely (so closely, baby)
Then he whispered softly (ooh)
Will you be my one and only
My only girl
When a woman wants her man
She'll catch him any way she can

I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk

intro: instrumental
verse 1:
This ride is going way too fast
I need something that will last, something like your love
I've had the temporary thrills
I need the kind of love that heals, I want to be with you
pre chorus:
Cause I've tried so hard to make it on my own
Why is it so hard for me to see the path that you have shown
chorus:
I don't know who I am 6x
with out you
Verse 2:
It seems to easy to fall away
but that's not where I want to stay, I want to stay with you
I've had the temporary joys
but nothing that can fill the void, deep within my soul
