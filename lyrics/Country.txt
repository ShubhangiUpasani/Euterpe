She loves to buy those designer clothes
And she tends to cry at the picture show
And she'll make plans without telling me
And I don't understand
I guess it's just a woman thing
Oh but whatever it is that I can't figure out
It all comes clear when she walks in
And the lights go down
And it's a mystery that I can't explain
But I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Now she'll go on about losing weight
While all along I'm thinking she looks great
I never know where her mood will swing
'Cause I'm just a man
And that's just a woman thing
Oh but whatever it is that I can't figure out
It all comes clear when she walks in
And the lights go down
It's a mystery that I can't explain
But I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Oh it's a mystery that I can't explain
I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Oh I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing

I need a room without a view
So nothing I see will remind me of you
Just four grey walls
To keep out the light of day
Must be a place that I can go
Where I can't look outside and know
That I'm the fool
That let you slip away
Closing my eyes won't do
I need a room without a view
If I had a room without a view
I'd have to pad all the mirrors too
Because what they show
Is just as hard on me
Don't wanna face the fact you're gone
Don"t wanna see another sunset alone
Cause when you're not here
Who needs the scenery
If I'm gonna make it through
I need a room without a view
Every thing from stars to sunlight
Or the wind blowing through the trees
Brings back the memory
Of a love that we shared
Pull the shades and draw the curtains
Board up the windows too
To get over you
I need a room without a view
Pull the shades and draw the curtains
Board up the windows too
To get over you
I need a room without a view
Oh yes I do
I need a room without a view

Can't you tell my love's a growin' can't you feel ain't it showin'
Though you must be a knowin' I got a big big love
It's not the kind to be concealin' just the kind to be revealin'
It's not a little bitty feelin' I got a big big love
I think it's time we done some walkin' I think it's time we done some talkin'
There's a great big moon above we got a big big love
This is not infatuation this is a true love sensational
It's not my imagination I got a big big love for you
[ steel ]
Can't you tell my love's a growin'...

(Alecia Elliott/Andy Bohatiuk/Bill Terry)
Some guys-ooh,they're really something
They're always acting like they're so hot
And you-you don't seem any different
I keep a wishin' but I guess you're not
You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?
Those eyes-ooh,I see right through'em
The way you stare gives you away
Don't even go there-ooh,you just don't get it
Real love can't be that way
You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?
Ooh,don't you think you oughta be ashamed
Ooh,I hate to tell you I don't play that game
You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?
You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what?

I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
Walking down lonely has worked like a charm
I'm the only one I have to let down
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
I can go on with my insecure nature
I can keep living off sympathy
I can tell all the people that all of the success
Is a direct reflection on me
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
What is important
What's really important
Am I not to know by my name
Will I ever know silence without mental violence
With a ringing that might go away
It's up to you my father called on me
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life

I woke up this morning
The room felt empty and bare
As I turned to the closet
Your clothes were not there
I walked to the kichen
Found our little girl with a note
As I read it to myself
the tears began to flow and she said
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but thats ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
I looked down at her
through tear stained eyes
It is though you were there in a tiny disguise
She clenches her pyjama
With that soft little hand
See all this that's happening
She can't quite understand but she says
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but thats ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
Searching my heart
And trying to explain
But the words that come out
Are swollen with pain
She looks through my eyes
Right down to my soul
Sees all the hurt
That I can't control and she says
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but that's ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
Please daddy don't cry that way
I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay

You're always in the fridge or on the phone
How the hell would you know you're never home
I go to work, to keep this family fed
Good try pal but you won't even get out of bed
I can't believe you spent that much on shoes
Look I got them on sale and you'll never know the money I save you
So I suppose you bought a bag, a dress and a hat
Well, you've got your race car want to talk about that
You look so damn cute when you get mad
It melts away my troubled heart and you don't seem so bad
When I see that twinkle in your eye
We take the phone off the hook and put the kids to bed
Forget what we said and love away the night
You're always on the couch watching football
Bring me a beer and keep it down, will ya
I don't want to miss the score just like you missed our anniversary
Well, I'm sorry babe, but you should have reminded me

This song has no lyrics, it's instrumental.

You disappear a day or so
I have no idea where you go
Then out of the blue you cross my mind
It's me and you just like old times
Walking in the autumn breeze
Kickin' up the fallen leaves
I close my eyes, and you're right here
Sayin' this is my favorite time of year
Whenever you come back to me
I run to meet your memory
Let it take me back to yesterday
Down a country road that winds
Through golden leaves and better times
To a place where my heart longs to be
Whenever you come back to me
Even though I know you're gone
I read your name written on the stone
In my dreams there's a river wide
Where we walk side by side
We leave foot prints in the sand
You let go of my hand
At the waters edge you turn and smile
Say I'll see you in a little while
When ever you come back to me
I run to meet your memory
Let it take me back to yesterday
Down a country road that winds
Through golden leaves and better times
To a place where my heart longs to be
Whenever you come back to me

Whoa whoa
She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listen to the Beatles singin' 'Back in the U-S-S-R'
Yeah she's goin' around the world tonight
But she ain't leavin' here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight
Just another American Saturday night
There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They've got Canadian bacon on they're pizza pie
They've got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like were all livin' in a big ol' cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight (whoa)
Just another American Saturday night
You know everywhere there's something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great great great granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this
You know everywhere has somethin' they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy, and Chinatown, sittin' there side by side
Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!
It's a French kiss, Italian ice,
Spanish moss in the moonlight
Just another American, just another American,
Its just another American Saturday night

I'm writing my last love letter
And for reasons now, I don't know where to start
Seems so many times I've written down "I love you"
Well I hope this time I can get that through your heart
Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall
But I can't fool around forever
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter
And maybe I was wrong to ever think that you could love me
I was hoping you just couldn't find the time
Have my efforts been in vain with pen and paper?
Did you ever care, did I ever cross your mind?
Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall
But I can't fool around forever
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter

Does anyone know of a girl who might like a tired old boy on a rusty old bike
Who just pulled in today from the Florida Glades
And just got to stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
Does anyone know of someone who can use
A hard working fool who don't ever touch booze
Who's only vice is a roll of a dice
And he's just got to stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
Easy there lady I don't want no trouble I'll pay for my chili and leave
Easy there mister I got the money and if I was you I'd let go of my sleeve
Does anyone know of a place I can sleep
Where I won't hear the cry of the wind as she weeps
For a poor wandering soul who got no place to go
And just got to stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
No fellers you can't have a ride cause my bike and my girls I don't share
Hey sheriff thank you for stoppin' and being concerned bout the length of my hair
Can anyone lend me a half tank of gas
And I guess that a smile would be too much to ask
Cause your warm friendly town don't want my kind around
And I guess I can't stop and rest awhile and rest awhile
Hello mama your boys comin' home cause my bike and my dreams all got wrecked
No mama don't hung up the phone I'm sorry that I had to call you collect
Can anyone lend me a half tank...

Damn this wicked world
Damn I wish that heaven wasn't hidden like a pearl
Underneath the sea
I wish all the answers came more easily to me
Watching as my world spins out of control
And I'd like to make it stop, did everything I was told
And I feel like that man
Making my last stand
In the field of crows
Damn the sky so blue
The more that I see clear, the more that I'm confused
Everything I know
Is always in the way of some direction I should go
Watching as my world spins out of control
And I'd like to make it stop, did everything I was told
And I feel like that man
Making my last stand
In the field of crows
Well I'm watching as my world spins out of control
And I'd like to make it stop, lord I did everything I was told
Still I feel like that man
Making my last stand
Oh yes I feel like that man
In the field of crows

Don't you want to sing a new gospel
Don't you want to find a way to rise above
If we both believe in the resurrection
We can find a new life for our love
It's a new gospel
Don't you want to hear the good news of forgiveness
Sins against our love are washed away
We have come through the valley of temptation
We have found a way to keep the faith
It's a new gospel
Well you might say I'm like a new apostle
You might say this love it is my creed
But I will go on preaching this new gospel
It's the saving grace for you and me
It's a new gospel
Let love, sweet love be born again

(Parks)
Mama, I remember what you told me
You said you wait for love before you fall
But, mama, I am sorry, I guess it's gonna be love after all
'Cause mama, when he holds me
The air is thick and sweet
He asked me if I'd come tonight
And hold him in his sleep
And I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes, I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost in
Yes, I'm almost in love
Mama, I've grown into a woman
I been growing stronger and stronger day by day
Mama, you know about children
You raise them then they'll go away
Mama, when he holds me
He thrills me through and through
So dry your eyes and teach me how to say goodbye to you
And I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes, I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost in
Yes, I'm almost in love
Yes I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost
Yes, I'm almost in love

I can't make you turn around
And I can't take back what I did
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me
Before you slam that open door
And throw away four good years
Think of everything we used to be
I know you say that you're over me
But I'm askin you, beggin you not to leave
[Chorus]
What if I told you I've changed
Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
That you could move on
What if you stay
I know right now it's hard to breathe
Hard to think and hard to see
All the reasons we should work it out
It might be easier to go,
But if you walk out, you'll never know
How strong we could be at the end of this
I know that sorry is not enough
But I'll do everything, anything to make it up
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
What if I told you I've changed
Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
You could move on
What if you stay
Oooooo
I can't make you turn around
And I can't take back what I did
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me

There's something talkin' in the wind
Whispering through the trees
That feeling in my bones again
Just puts me right at ease
It takes me back to all the times
I' ve been here before
But crossroads, old familiar signs
Tell me there's something more
Can't explain, there's something strange about the early fall
It's comfort leaving me without a care
I remain but everything around me hears the call
And tonight I feel a change in the air
The leaves are turning, soon they'll fall
There's a norther blowing in
The memories flowin', I recall
Those changes in the wind
But I can never try to understand
There's nothing you can hold in your hand
Can't explain, there's something strange about the early fall
It's comfort leaving me without a care
I remain but everything around me hears the call
And tonight I feel a change in the air
Yes I'll surely feel a change in the air

Took a trip on a bus that didn't know
Met a girl sellin' drinks at the disco
Said truth comes back when you let it go
Seem complicated cause it's really so simple
Walkin' down Yonge Street on a Friday
Can't follow them, gotta do it my way
No fast lane, still on the highway
Movin' in and out, no doubt there's a brighter day...
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... check out the crabs in the bucket
It's like flies on the windscreen, writing on walls
square biz clones claim they're havin a ball
feelin' themselves just before last call
Tic-a-tic-a-toc tic-a-tic-a-toc
Clock strikes twelve, clock strikes one
Smoking gun put these fools on the run
I know it's not that simple, I know it's not that hard
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... check out the crabs in the bucket
It's a conniption, fit from the microphones flit
I take it higher like a bird on a wire, retire the fire
I never cause I'm just moving on up
Choosin' to touch, the unseen, craving the clutch
Damm, if mirrors were created by sand
then I'm looking in the water for reflections of man
Understand the minds above time when it's empty
Emcee, Tragically Hip - Ahead by a Century
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... check out the crabs in the bucket
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... check out the crabs in the bucket

Oh come along with me to my little corner of the world
And dream a little dream in my little corner of the world
Tonight my love we'll share a sweet embrace
You'll soon forget there's any other place
And if you'd care to stay in my little corner of the world
Then we can hide away in my little corner of the world
I always knew I'd find someone like you so welcome to my little corner of the world
(Oh come along with me) to my little corner of the world
(And dream a little dream) in my little corner of the world
And if you'd care to stay

In my imagination
You are my dear companion
And I'm the one you cling to
And your voice still calls my name
Before your heart began to wander
And mine was torn asunder
Before the fairer and the younger
Before the cryin' game
All those girls with their long dark tresses
Waltzing out in their Sunday dresses
All their sweet soft warm caresses
Cannot hold you like l do
And though you say you do notlove me
And your dreams are never of me
I will dream my dream of you
In my dreams you are the swallow
Coming back to Capistrano
And I'm the sound of the bells you follow
But in this world dreams don't come true
Still when you're lost out in the desert
When your fire's a dying ember
The last light you remember
Will be the light l shed for you
Mine is no ordinary star love
I see exactly where you are love
And no one else could shine that far love
To bring you safely through
And though you say you do not want me
And made no promises to haunt me
I will dream my dream of you
The sorrows flow down like a fountain
Over the miles beyond our countin'
More than the flowers of the mountain
Or the raindrops in the sea
But if Heaven's just a dreaming
Surely my love will be redeeming
And you will dream your dream of me

Alright bro
We're gonna have a talk about this
I brought you in this club and you done stole my girl
And that ain't right
When we walked into the club I thought it was understood, mmm, hmm
It was my turn tonight and it was your job to make me look good
Then I pointed out that sweet little beauty in black, yes I did
I sent you over with a couple of drinks and you never came back
[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
Shortly after you left, I was cussing your name, hell I was
When her ugly girlfriend comes over starts working her game, mmm
And I couldn't scare her off no matter what I'd said, nah, no
I was thinkin' I'm the one that should be kissing on that cutie instead
[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
Whoa
They say, all is fair in love and war
And all in time I'm gonna settle that score
It ain't win or lose, it's how you play the game
If I was in your shoes, I might've done it just the same
[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing man it should've been me
That's taking her home
Is taking her home, ohh
You were supposed to be my wingman, mmm, mmm

At the bottom of Green Mountain William Deacon stands and stares into the rain
With coal grey eyes yellow teeth and a face that shows the strain
Of his fight against the people who would cut Green Mountain down
To paid away for what they say is a short cut in the town
Their sugar and the gas tanks of the dosers and the graters and mud
The grits they finished yesterday was washed away by last night's ragin' flood
And the dam went out with dynamite strollin's from the work through shack
But the coal grey eyes of William Deacon never once looked back
They're gonna move Green Mountain he can't stand in the way
But William Deacon swears Green Mountain's gonna stay
They're gonna move Green Mountain at least that's what they say
But there he stands lookin' twice as big as he did yesterday
For hundred years and more the Deacon Clan has planned Green Mountain as dear home
But the highway department don't have the sence to leave well enough alone
Witn an iron hand he raised ten kids and taught 'em right from wrong
And then trouble come the Deacon Clan can be mighty bight and strong
They carried William Deacon's body down from old Green Mountain yesterday
He was crashed by a rollin' grabble truck when he stepped out into the way
The forman round then said well now the work can start again
But he forgot the family pride of all the Deacon Clan
They're gonna move Green Mountain...

I heard every word you said
And trying hard to understand
Exactly what it is, you need, from me
Baby I apologize
I never meant to make you cry
But there ain't no doubt, we can work it out yeah
Cause I'm gonna be around
[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
I ain't no maybe
Rain or Shine
This Love of mine is for you
Let my arms remind you
I'll always be beside you
Holdin' on until this ride is through
So away we go, down that forever road
Baby as our lives unfold
There's no telling where we'll go
But as far as I can see, it'll be you and me
Just the way it's supposed to be
[Chorus]
It ain't gonna be easy
We'll both make big mistakes
But if you love me, trust me
We've got what it takes
Now
[Chorus]
Down that forever road
Away we go

In the great book of John you'll wonder the day
When you'll be laid beneath the cold clay
The angel of death will come from the sky
And claim up your soul when the day comes to die
When the angel of death comes down after you
Can you smile and say that you have been true
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death
When the lights all grow dim and the dark shadows creep
And your loved ones have gathered to weep
Can you face them and say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death
When the angel of death comes down after you
Can you smile and say that you have been true
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death

It's a wonder of wonders like a magical spring
How I met you I loved you and it changed everything
But the greatest of wonders just a thing it could be
My reason for living is because you love me
Since I know that you need me and your love I can feel
My life has a meaning and my fate is so real
Love has answered life's questions for at last I can see
My reason for living is because you love me
In your love there's a rightness that no words can explain
Like the living in heaven or that sun follows rain
I see goodness and beauty that I never did see
My reason for living is because you love me
Since I know that you need me...
My reason for living is because you love me

After three good years together we had our first big fight
So she went to her mother's and I went for a ride
Down an old familiar highway, just a few miles out of town
To that rundown one-room tavern that used to be my stomping ground
Well I pulled in the driveway, you know it all still looked the same
And I couldn't wait to down a few and hear that jukebox ring
Well as I walked into the doorway, oh there stood some kind of Matre D'
Well he looked me up and he looked me down, said
"May I help you please?", and I said
"What'd you do with those swinging doors?
Where's the sawdust, on the floor?
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties?
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And who's idea was it to hang these furs?
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song"
Well I look back to the corner where the jukebox once stood proud
Some fool was playing records, too fast, too long, and too loud
And it must have been a big mistake to try to speak my mind
So as they were asking me to leave I cried out one more time
What'd you do with those swinging doors?
Where's the sawdust, on the floor?
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties?
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And who's idea was it to hang these furs?
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song
I guess I don't belong without a jukebox and a country song

They call me the clown
I can juggle while I?m spinning round
Take all the dark clouds away
With a well rehearsed display
The spotlights on me
And everybody wants the clown to be
The one who laughs at the world
They think I?m their funny girl
With a painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown
I balance between
The truth and what lies hidden up my sleeve
And when it all gets too hard
I just play the joker card
Another curtain call
Another routine where I did it all
Every trick and surprise
To keep my thin disguise
A painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown
Did you hear the one about the girl,
Who hid inside her circus world?
Now she wonders what it?s all for
Coz it?s not funny anymore
Painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown
Everyone loves a clown

The coffee's all gone and my eyes burn like fire
It's way past the hour when most folks retire
You said that you'd call me but you haven't yet and I'm down to my last cigarette
I'm down to my last cigarette you're down to the last chance you'll get
For you're out there somewhere with someone you've met
And I'm down to my last cigarette
I can't leave this room you might call while I'm gone
The minutes seem hours soon will be dawn
And with every minute I give more upset and I'm down to my last cigarette
I'm down to my last cigarette

Standing on a hill, staring at a mountain;
Swallows dive and turn, trying to catch what we can't see;
Sure ain't the first time; hope it ain't the last time
When all the work is done, by the light of a setting sun;
We see what we've become -- two of the lucky ones.
The wind is gonna blow, trees are gonna sway in kind;
And babe, I know you know... that they don't have to try;
Sure ain't the first time; hope it ain't the last time
When all the work is done, by the light of a setting sun;
We see what we've become -- two of the lucky ones.
For the very first time, there's no words to be found;
Opened up our eyes, there was love all around --
When all the work is done, by the light of a setting sun;
We see what we've become -- two of the lucky ones.
Standing on a hill, staring at a mountain.

(Dolly Parton)
When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation, I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay

All the sailors with their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
They're singin' songs for pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars at the door
And you can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter
And all the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade
And you can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence, it may be shattered
It doesn't matter
And all the bush league batters
Are left to die on the diamond
And in the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles

(Dolly Parton)
Oh, you're out there tonight with another
And my pain is so dreadfully sharp.
I picture you with her and shudder,
It's like a dagger through the heart
Do you think that my feelings don't matter,
Or your cheatin' or hurtful remarks
When you leave me all broken and shattered
It's like a dagger through the heart
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,
It's like a dagger through the heart
Oh, you cut me to pieces so often
Like a knife or a poisonous dart
I would be better off in my coffin,
It's like a dagger through the heart
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,
It's like a dagger through the heart
Like a dagger through the heart, through the heart

Oh lighten up, where's your sense of humor
They're just tiny little rumors
That I started 'cause I'm lookin' out for you
Ah settle down, I'm just a little jealous
And I'm sure those other fellas
Never once believed the lies I told were true
Like the time I told that cowboy that you used to be a man
And the doctor you were datin' that you hide your wedding band
Even if I am responsible for scaring them away
You really ought to thank me, I was doin' you a favor
'Cause it never woulda worked out anyway
Ah can't you see, the reason that I'm doin'
All the crazy things I'm doin'
Is because I really care about you girl
And I'll admit that I go a little farther
Than I know I probably oughta
But it's all because I need you in my world
Like the time I told that lawyer that you spent a year in jail
And the salesman you were seein' you hang out at cheap motels
Even if I am responsible for scaring them away
You really ought to thank me, I was doin' you a favor
'Cause it never woulda worked out anyway
I can't stand the thought of you with anybody else
I know I've gone overboard but I can't help myself
Like the time I told that dentist you had seven little kids
And you doubled as a dancer at the strip joint on the ridge
Even if I am responsible for scaring him away
You really ought to thank me, I was doin' you a favor
'Cause it never woulda worked out anyway
It's all because I love you and I can't stop thinkin' of you
And it never woulda worked out anyway

Oh the night came undone like a party dress
And fell at her feet in a beautiful mess
The smoke and the whiskey came home in her curls
And they crept through the dreams of the barroom girls
Well she tosses and turns because the sun is unkind
And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
But eave all the blue skies for the rest of the world
Because the neon will shine for the barroom girls
Oh the barroom girls go by your side
Like the ponies who pass on a carousel ride
And all of the colors go 'round in a swirl
When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls
Now she rolls to her feet when she can't sleep no more
And looks at her clothes lying out on the floor
Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls
Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls

I got a good foundation
On a bad reputation
Got a floor I've been pacing
And a broken heart breaking
In a game of fools
I'd be hard to beat
Yeah, if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
I got a bottle that's empty
And a [?] that gets me
If I was me, I'd quit me
When I gambled my last 50
On a game of fools
But it ain't easy streak
Yeah, if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Hey, hey, I'm on a roll
Gone as low as a low can go
Standing at the old crossroads
Damned old devil won't buy my soul
Hey, hey, I blow on the dice
[?]
This old town, it don't play nice
Hit me once, hell, hit me twice
If losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Yes, I am
Well, my mind is unadjusted
And my guitar strings are rusted
Had somebody that I trusted
Leave me broke and busted
On a game of fools
Now I'm drowning in defeat
Yeah, if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Oh, baby, if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Hey, I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll now, child
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll now, baby
Hey, I'm on a roll
Hey, I'm on a roll
Hey, I'm on a roll now, baby

No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
You've hurt me but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
That I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
I'll tell them I've found true love with another

No one's gonna jerk me around
Once I get my feet on the ground
I'm gonna hit it runnin'
Gonna call it a day
See, a little bit of tension
Goes a long, long way
The boss man has got mine in a sling
But I'll be swingin when I loosen up my strings
Every night when the sun goes down
You won't find me hangin around
I'm in loco-motion like a rock out on roll
I'm nobody's puppet
I'm out of control
The boss man has got mine in a sling
But I'll be swingin when I loosen up my...
Now, when it comes to getting down
And I'm always keepin track
I don't need some yo-yo takin up my slack
The boss man has got mine in a sling
But I'll be swingin when I loosen up my strings
Yeah, he'll have a line on me til my fat lady sings
But I'll be swingin while I loosen up my strings
Yeah, we'll all be swingin while I loosen up my strings
Hey, we'll all be swingin when I loosen up my strings

If you don't want me baby if you're not satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse and ride ride ride
Since you've got on your high horse those fancy friends you've found
You have a hard time seein' me you're always looking down
If you don't want me baby...
You talked about me honey you tried to tear me down
But while you're throwin' dirt at me you're only losing ground
If you don't want me baby...
[ steel ]
If you don't want me baby...
I'll have your second fiddle returned to you today
Cause baby that's one instrument that I'd never played
If you don't want me baby...
If you don't want me baby...
Ride ride ride ride ride ride

(Dolly Parton)
I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that led me out of his life
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder
The day that I told him good-bye
I never should'a left him
Never should'a gone
Oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
And will he take me back again
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
Shadows from the trees
Shade the path that I am walkin'
As I make my way back up that windy road again
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end
I wonder if he missed me
Wonder if he wants me
I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
Cry, mmmm

Jesus Christ, with signs followin',
serpents in the air.
Hellbent on heaven bound,
your earthly end is near.
Guarded by the divine,
we're practicin' our faith.
There's more than chance at work here,
or strychnine in this place.
Jesus Christ, with signs following,
serpents up in the air.
Hellbent on heaven bound,
your earthly end is near.
Hellbent. For heaven bound!
Hellbent for heaven bound...
Lost me 15 years ago,
they say I lost my faith.
Now at home with the Lord of you,
someone has taken my place.
Jesus Christ, with signs followin',
serpents up in the air.
We're hell bent upon heaven bound,
your earthly end is near.
Hellbent. For heaven bound!
Hellbent for heaven bound.
Hellbent for heaven bound
Hellbent for heaven bound...

Oh girl I don't know what to say
I feel you love me less each day
You seem so far away
And there's not a kiss that's strong enough
I could give to keep your love
To change your mind to stay
So you packed your bags
Said you need a break
And you left me here to wait
Said you might come back some day
So I'm holding on
In spite of what they say
They say "man she's gone"
And only a fool would wait
And call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
I've nowhere else to be
And nothing left to do
Call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
And there's nowhere I'd rather be
Then waiting here for you
So call me a fool
Oh girl the time goes by so slow
Just staring at the door
Hoping you'll walk through
So if I hang on long enough
Would I be worth your love?
'Cause its something I could do
I'm just holding on
In spite of what they say
They say "man she's gone"
And only a fool would wait
So call me a fool
Still holding on
In spite of what they say
They say "man she's gone"
And only a fool would wait
Then call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
I've nowhere else to be
And nothing left to do
Call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
And there's nowhere I'd rather be
Then waiting here for you
So call me a fool
Oh girl I don't know what to say
I feel you love me less each day
You seem so far away
And there's not a kiss that's strong enough
I could give to keep your love
To change your mind to stay
So you packed your bags
Said you need a break
And you left me here to wait
Said you might come back some day

This is the boy that live in a house that love built
These are the arms that held the charms of the sweetest girl in town
These are the hands that made the plans for a house that love built
And this is the heart that got broke when the house got tumblin' down
The roof was made of moonlight with kisses warm and sweet
And all the beams were made of dreams that I laid at your feet
So walls are made of sunshine the sunshine of your smile
And all the bliss of that first kiss was mine for just a while
[ steel ]
This is the boy who destroyed the house that love built
My empty arms have lost the charms of the sweetest girl in town
These are the hands that made the plans for a house that love built
And this is the heart that got broke when the house got tumblin' down
The roof was made of moonlight with kisses warm and sweet
And all the beams were made of dreams that I laid at your feet
If you'll start all over and say that you're still mine
I'll build from love that's strong enough to stand the test of time

I walk through my front door
She's right there like the day before
Saying "Daddy, please, play with me"
Right there in the living room
In a ponytail and ballet shoes
I spin her 'round, she says out loud
"I wish this song would last forever"
Dance baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance, dance baby dance, baby dance
And one day she'll pack up to leave
She'll kiss her mom and then kiss me
And say "Goodbye, Dad, are you alright?"
I'll just smile and tell her "yes"
And try to hide this big old mess
Inside my heart as she starts the car
That's why I wish this song would last forever
Dance baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance, dance baby dance, baby dance
And I know there's gonna come a time
When she'll be there all dressed in white
And I'll take her hand for one last dance
Dance baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance, dance baby dance, baby dance
Baby dance

I've had big dreams come true
And I believe in angels
Although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do
Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind 'cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you
I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth living
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayer that I've had answered
I did something right
'Cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you

FLAME IN MY HEART
(George Jones - Bernard Spurlock)
« © '59 Glad Music »
WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY
You cheated on me (you cheated me)
I tried to be fair (I tried to be fair)
But you don't believe enduring your share
But I've learned my lesson (I've learned my lesson)
And now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me like they used to do
Your arms only chill me I'm glad that we're through
My heart was once yearning (my heart was once yearning)
But now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
You fool me a while (you fool me a while)
You thought you were wise (you thought you were wise)
You even believed I fell for your life
But the trick's turned on you (the trick's turned on you)
Now gladly I say (now gladly I say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me...

I was sitting on top of the world
Deep in love with a blue-eyed girl
But the blue-eyed girl told me goodbye
I fell like rain drops out of the sky
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart
I took my love for Sally Ann
And I buried if deeper than a chinaman
Where no one goes and no one can see
There ain't nobody here but me
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart
One day true love's gonna set me free
But till then i'll be here deep in misery
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

Cowboys and outlaws, right guys and south-paws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
Dirt roads and white lined, and all kinds of stop signs
I'll stand right here where I'm at
Cause I wear my own kind of hat.
There's two kinds of lovers, two kinds of brothers
Two kinds of babies to hold.
There's two kinds of cherries, two kinds of fairies
Two kinds of mothers I'm told, I'm told
Cowboys and outlaws, right guys and south-paws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
Dirt roads and white lines and all kinds of stop signs
I'll stand right here where I'm at
Cause I wear my own kind of hat.
There's two kinds of brother, two kinds of lovers
Two kinds of babies to hold
There's two kinds of cherries, two kinds of fairies
Two kinds of mothers I'm told, I'm told

Your walls are lines with pictures of your triumphs through the years
Your doors is bolted tight against all wordly want and fear
But you left your passion and your pain with your first love back in school
You fool you fool
In your penthouse high from the dirty streets I swear you'll never find
The answers to the questions that muddy up your mind
For your window shades are drawn upon the wicked and the cruel
You fool you fool
You give your share the charity without a second thought
And you are kind to animals for that's what you've been taught
But all your real emotion you proudly overrule
You fool you fool
You've planned your life so carefully for society's delight
And still you can't quite understand why things just don't seem right
It's a love like fresh out homemade bread will sat aside to cool
You fool you fool you fool

Parody of "Man Of Constant Sorrow" (Traditional)
New lyrics by Cledus T. Judd/Chris "P. Cream" Clark/ Cledus Crap Anthems(SESAC)/Of Music, Inc. (SESAC)
Uh yessir do you have Man of Constant Borrow by Cledus T. Judd
No sir somebody's already borrowed it
Constantly borrows everything
I'm the man of constant borrow
There's nothing I can call my own
Some may try to say it's all stolen
I prefer permanently loaned
He's the biggest mooch we ever known
SOLO
My grass mowin
Bot I've got no mower
My neighbor won't let me use his
I can't really say is though I blame him
Kept it three years last time I did
He thought for sure that it was his
I need a ride down to the pawn shop
Lend me the keys to your Corvette
What do you mean you don't trust me
I never not brought it back yet
I don't think I could take that bet
You know dang well (he's gone away)
Well you may have heard of me
Cledus T J-you-double-D
Better known as the reining King of country parody
Coming with a new style
High profile
When I'm on the mike well you know I'll get hog wild
Comedian
Extrodinaire
A fat Eminem with the bleach blonde hair
I know that you think
I've got your chainsaw
You can't find it anywhere
I can't cut no wood
Since way fore winter
I gave it back to you last fair
Check his garage it's probably there
I sure could use a hundred dollars
I'll gladly pay you back Tuesday
I know that's what I said the last time
You can't believe a word I say
He has no plans to (really???) pay

I wasn't stranded in the desert
I wasn't drifting out to sea
I was in no kind of danger
That would be the death of me
But when you took me in your arms
Like an angel from above
I was saved, saved by love
I wasn't strung out in some alley
With a habit I couldn't kick
Wasn't lost in dark depression
I wasn't hurting. I wasn't sick
Didn't have all that I needed
But what I had seemed like enough
'Til I was saved, saved by love
You don't long for what you don't know
You don't miss what you never had
You just watch your life float on by
Not too good, not too bad
Looking back before you found me
What a sad, sad case I was
'Til I was saved, saved by love
Now I look at all the wrong turns
I've passed along the way
The dead ends I'd of raced down
And the price I would've paid
There but for the grace of you
Who knows where I'd of wound up
But I was saved, saved by love

You've sure got a real nice place
So don't take this the wrong way
But I can tell by your decorating taste
You've been alone too long
You've got more candles than a midnight mass
That fancy mirror adds a touch of class
But do you know how good a mounted bass
Would look there on that wall
[Chorus]
You need a man around here
You can't do it all by yourself
To me it's painfully clear
That you could use a little help
Someone to kill the spiders
Change the channel and drink the beer
Seems to me that you sure need
A man around here
Thumbing through your stack of magazines
I don't see a Maxim or Field and Stream
I haven't been in a room this clean
Since they took my appendix out
Well you've gotta be kidding me
Don't tell me that thing is your TV
My laptop's got a bigger screen
Baby there ain't no doubt,
[Chorus]

These times are troubled and these times are good
And they're always gonna be, they rise and they fall
We take 'em all the way that we should
Together you and me forsaking them all
Deep in the night and by the light of day
It always looks the same, true love always does
And here by your side, or a million miles away
Nothin's ever gonna change the way that I feel,
The way it is, is the way that it was
When I said I do, I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do
Well this old world keeps changin', and the world stays the same
For all who came before, and it goes hand and hand
Only you and I can undo all that we became
That makes us so much more, than a woman and a man
And after everything that comes and goes around
Has only passed us by, here alone in our dreams
I know there's a lonely heart in every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means
When I said I do, I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do

There isn't anyone in this whole wide world I trust as much as I trust you my baby
But the thought of comin' home dear and find you've gone oh oh how it scares me
Though I have fate in you in everything you do
It scares me just to think how it would be
The thought of someone new making love to you oh oh how it scares me
[ guitar ]
Though I have fate in you...
Oh oh how it scares me

Hey man I'm glad you asked
'Cause I know more about that than I want to
And I'll share it with you
If you don't work things out
And save your love somehow
You'll know it then
What it's like at the bitter end
First comes the downpour, an emotional uproar
Brought on by "don't love you anymore"
Followed by a slammin' door
Then ol' lonely moves in
And the hurt begins
That's what it's like my friend
If you let it come to a bitter end
If time were on my side
Then it would let me fly back to the night
Of our last fight
And I could hold my tongue
And hold on to the one I should've never let go
Then I wouldn't have to know everything about
The downpour, that emotional uproar
Brought on by "don't love you anymore"
Followed by a slammin' door
Then ol' lonely moves in
And the hurt begins
And that's what it's like my friend
If you let it come to a bitter end
First comes the downpour, an emotional uproar
Brought on by "don't love you anymore"
Followed by a slammin' door
Then ol' lonely moves in
And the hurt begins
That's what it's like my friend
If you let it come to a bitter end
Hey man I'm glad you asked
'Cause I know more about that than I want to

I don't leave any room for doubt
When it comes to you and me
You know all about the way I feel inside
You know how hard I try
But that don't mean that I can't
Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger
You tell me you're the lucky one
But I see things differently
I have just begun to show you that you mean
Everything to me
I still feel the need to
Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger
Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger
Love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther, anything to please you girl
Tonight I'm gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, gonna love a little stronger
Gonna love a little stronger
Gonna love a little stronger

They said your cheating heart will make me cry
And like a fool I gave it a try
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
But I could not believe the things they said
Because my heart over ruled my head
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was foolin' myself
I know it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was foolin' myself
I know it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

I used to wish that I was
Great as any man
Better than I am
Could do things no one can
And I used to wish that I was cool as I could be
But now I'm learning to live with me
Is anybody satisfied with who they really are
You could be the moon
And still be jealous of the stars
You gotta' learn to swim
If you can't walk upon the sea
So I'm learning to live with me
And I used to wish that I was
Braver than the rest
A hero nothin' less
A big duke in the west
But I know the way I am is who I'm gonna be
So I'm learing to live with me
Is anybody satisfied with who they really are
You could be the moon
And still be jealous of the stars
You gotta' learn to swim
If you can't walk upon the sea
So I'm learning to live

LIFE RIDES THE TRAIN
WRITER PORTER WAGONER
Time waits for no one time never will
But moments of happiness can make time seem still
But time moves on swiftly passes life by while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train for some it moves slow
Some never find where their train of life will go
If it's bound to hell or to heaven on high
And while life rides the train time always flies
As life rides the train some get off the track
For one careless moment but never get back
Until it's much too late time has passed them by
So while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train...

I came from a town that was so small you look both ways and you could see it all
All I wanted was some way out every evening I'd slip into town
And stand around by the caution light and watch the big trucks rolling by
For me it was a beautiful sight big wheels in the moonlight
I had a case of wanderlust I'd lie awake with the windows up
Out on highway fifty-nine I could hear some big old diesel whine
She was going through all the gears headed out to who knows where
I fell asleep most every night dreaming about big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
How I got here it's hard to say so many things got in my way
Can't complain about all I've got kids and a wife and a regular job
But at night when I'm setting here all alone in a living room chair
Sometimes I close my eyes and see big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind

Everybody says don't lose your head
You gotta keep that pretty smile upon your face
Well I did that for awhile but it just was not my style
I kept endin' up in that forbidden place
I'm a happy woman but when I get knocked to the ground
I invite the blues to come around
So don't be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
Let the river rage on by and the wind blow
If you pay your dues in darkness
You'll appreciate the light
Cause a deep down low makes level feel so high
I put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
I go ahead and cry the make-up from my eyes
I let my mind play tricks and then
I let it fool me once again
Into thinkin' that I'll never be alright
Then when I'm no longer crazy and I'm back to my old self
I realize how good I've always felt
So don't be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
Let the river rage on by and the wind blow
If you pay your dues in darkness
You'll appreciate the light
Cause a deep down low makes level feel so high
Let yourself go under
Touch the bottom of the pool
Ain't it strange and don't you wonder
How you always come back up and it's so cool
So don't be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
Let the river rage on by and the wind blow
If you pay your dues in darkness
You'll appreciate the light
Cause a deep down low makes level feel so high

You call me up at five to five, and you ask me if I'll drop by
That you need me, tonight you're all alone
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be, I drove there anxiously
But when I got there, you were not alone
[Chorus:]
When will I ever learn that you'll never care about me?
You only build me up to bring me down again
When will I ever learn that you'll use me and abuse me?
Oh, tell me; when will I ever learn?
When will I learn, when will I get wise; you never apologize
I swear that this time I'm through with you
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be, the next time you need me
Once again I'll give in to you
[Chorus]

Whatever happened to tenderness it just disappeared with gentleness
Oh did they run away with togetherness oh where has our love gone
Where has our love gone what's happened to you and me
Who's to blame for all of this pain and where has our love gone
[ steel ]
Once we were blessed with happiness once there was no place for loneliness
Now all I've got is forgetfulness oh where has our love gone
Where has our love gone...
Oh where has our love gone

Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you've long gone
You left me and the river here all alone
[Chorus]
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues
Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the gall
And washed your picture right off the wall
[Chorus]
Well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
So if you change your mind honey I'll be here
Waiting on the banks of that ol' Dog River
[Chorus]

I'm a ship, I'm a ship, I'm a ship
Out on the sea
None of my love
Floating wild come back to me
So I write you a letter, I'll write you a letter
With this here pen
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
'Cause I'm your friend
I'm in love with the garden
That is down the street
And the earth is a warm thing under my feet
And the earth is a warm thing under my feet
Oh, long streams of light
Lift me from this dirty town
'Cause I am losing stain
Soak me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
With rain, rain, rain, rain
Oh, I'm a ship, I'm a ship, I'm a ship
Out on the sea
And all these clouds flying by so fast
Well, they confuse me
And the long leaves in the tall trees
Pale in the sunshine
And I was twistin' and turnin'
In the cool sheets past bed time
Plant me in the garden
Don't you let me roam
'Cause love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Plant me in the garden
Don't you let me roam
'Cause love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Yeah, love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Plant me in the garden
Don't you let me roam
'Cause love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Yeah, love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Love is a feeling like a warm dark stone

Well I come from the rural Midwest
It's the land I love more than all the rest
It's the place I know and understand
Like a false-front building
Like the back of my hand
And the men I knew when I was coming up
Were sober as coffee in a Styrofoam cup
There were Earls and Rays, Harlans and Roys
They were full-grown men
They were barbed wire boys
They raised grain and cattle on the treeless fields
Sat at the head of the table and prayed before meals
Prayed an Our Father and that was enough
Pray more than that and you couldn't stay tough
Tough as the busted thumbnails on the weathered hands
They worked the gold plate off their wedding bands
And they never complained, no they never made noise
And they never left home
These barbed wire boys
'Cos their wildest dreams were all fenced in
By the weight of family, by the feeling of sin
That'll prick your skin at the slightest touch
If you reach too far, if you feel too much
So their deepest hopes never were expressed
Just beat like bird's wings in the cage of their chest
All the restless longings, all the secret joys
That never were set free
In the barbed wire boys
And now one by one they're departing this earth
And it's clear to me now 'xactly what they're worth
Oh they were just like Atlas holding up the sky
You never heard him speak, you never saw him cry
But where do the tears go, that you never shed
Where do the words go, that you never said
Well there's a blink of the eye, there's a catch in the voice
That is the unsung song
Of the barbed wire boys

First you've gotta wanna get a hold
Bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place
And you'd better trust in you lady love
Pray to God she don't give up on you right now
Live fast, die young
Bull rider
One hand hold is all you got
But you and the bull against the clock
And of course, the crowd
And once upon a spinning turn
Nothing else you ever done can pull this weight
Just outside the buckin' shoe
You lose a spur, you lose, you'll see me lose yourself
By now he's buckin' mean and dirty
Slingin' shit in cowboy boots and kickin' clowns
No fools, the fun
Bull rider
You gotta feel the way (just feel the way)
You gotta watch his head (gotta watch his head)
Embrace yourself for anything
That will render you my friend
You know the art of hanging this
Hanging just as tight
Well it's something like a hurricane
Dancing with a kite
Well the rodeo this morning rode
It's a fact of life and it's tough to cut in its favorite hats
It's drinking beer and pulling trails
Idle may on barrel racers and of course a buck
No ridin', no pain
Bull rider
Live fast, die young
Bull rider

I'm swinming up
Stream
I'm climbing up hill
And it feels like maybe I always will
How do I fix this broke down heart
Just look at me baby I'm fallings apart
Why I woke up this morning only heaven knows
Spilled my cup of coffee and I burnt my toast
Can't find the keys 'cause they're locked in my car
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart
Chorus:
I remember the moment you looked in my eyes
You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye
Oh and right then and there is where I lost my spark
Now look at me baby I'm falling apart
Just look at me baby
I'm trying to be strong
But I need some time
Gotta get myself together
I've made up my mind
But how do I move on when I don't know where to start
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart
Chorus:
I remember the moment you looked in my eyes
You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye
Oh it cut me so deep that it hit me real hard
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart
Just look at me baby
Chorus:
I remember the moment you looked in my eyes
You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye
Oh and right then and there is where I lost my spark
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart
Just look at me baby
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart
Now look at me baby
Just look at me baby
Just look at m baby I'm falling apart
Now look at me baby
Just look at me baby

I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
In a shoebox the other night
In between cleaning up piles of messes
That I've made of my life
Ticket stubs, love poems and old letters
I dumped them all out on the bed
Found a homemade birthday card from my mom
And this is what it said
Yeah, this is what it said
Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
Full of things to look back on
I opened up my grandpa's pocket knife
And I was back to his back porch
It was summertime, I was turning nine
He said you want that knife, it's yours
I remember running off in the yard
Carved my name in every tree
I haven't held it since he passed away
Man it meant the world to me
Because he meant the world to me
Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
Look back on
A little window to the past
Look back on
God knows life goes by so fast
If ever you should ever doubt the blessings that you've had
Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
In a shoebox the other night

I'm just a workin' cowboy this ranch I'm on ain't mine
But I got a bed in the bunk houseand a place come supper time
I don't get much for wages but it's good enough for me
Maybe I don't own this place but mister I've got the key
Just a thirty dollar cowboy and I ride the lone prairie
The good Lord knows I'm happy cause I'm where I want to be
Well I ain't got much of nothing but I got about all I need
Just a thirty dollar cowboy with a million dollar dream
Someday I'm gonna buy a place that I can call my own
Find me a pretty lady and build us a little home
Until that day I'm gonna save all the wages I can
Who knows I may just buy this place and stay right where I am.
Just a thirty dollar cowboy...
Just a thirty dollar cowboy...
I'm just a thirty dollar cowboy with a million dollar dream

Whippoorwill won't ya listen
To my roaming story
We started out frying
Up a morning glory
I tell you 'bout the things ya like tknow I found
& how the moon woke us up with a jigglin' sound
In my fine leather truck
So I rolled up my dirty red pants
Took my shoes off
Crossed my legs when I danced
I did the hyena, the milkman and the fox-trot
We smoked our last then headed for the pine knot
In my fine leather truck
Then the rain came down
& soaked us all up
Could not keep the technology
From suckin' us up
Spiderman was all I could remember then
We crossed the walls
& left that ugly town
In my fine leather truck

The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in the kind of daydreams I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem to me that's everything
But dear I dream of you the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you the very thought of you my love
[ guitar ]
I see your face...

She still sits out on the range
Sun sets, she looks like a rose in the rain
Waiting and praying he's coming again
He rode like the breath of Nero
A real man - laid down his life for a friend
Fought for her life to the bitter end
And she won't care how long or where or when
She still believes he's coming 'round the bend
Until the last real cowboy rides again
She's saving all her sun sets until then love never ends
Six years since he's been gone
Some say they heard her calling her name
Dancing with him through the window pane
It can't be she must be crazy
Must be that she's got a heart that won't mend
But I think she visits him in the wind
When a cool breeze is rushing through her hair
There's one hand on her heart
The other she's waving in the air

There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky
And twice as many tear drops
there to wash it down
Every one's another lullaby
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
There's a world of trouble
Trying to take its turn
I can hear it shaking underground
And half a dozen lessons
I might never learn
Not until them troubles come around
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize
Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
You're the only one and only
Why'd you go and leave me lonely

You reach out and touch me and tell me you love me
And promise that you always will
But as i start to kiss your tender lips
I wake up to my living hell
These sweet dreams are killin' me
Your heavenly memory is pure misery
I'm losing my mind one night as a time
These sweet dreams are killin' me
When sleep comes i hold you just like i used to
In a world where our love still lives
But each mornin' i wake as i feel my heart break
When i lose you all over again
These sweet dreams are killin' me
Your heavenly memory is pure misery
I'm losing my mind one night as a time
These sweet dreams are killin' me
These sweet dreams are killin' me
These sweet dreams are killin' me

I called him for days, he didn't answer the phone
I drove by his house, I knew he was home
A week's worth of papers and mail in the box
I thought he was dead, I picked the lock
I found him in tears in the dark on his knees
With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be
And he said
Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse
Call for the lady with the alligator purse
She knows the spell to lift this curse
Go find the lady with the alligator purse
In an old stone house off 21st
I found the lady with the alligator purse
She answered the door, said I know who you are
She lit a candle, consulted the stars
When I saw her closing that reptile's hide
I asked her point-blank, is my friend going to die
And she said
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a nurse
I'm just the lady with the alligator purse
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
So said the lady with the alligator purse
She said, look at what happened to Cleopatra
When she didn't take my advice
And Romeo, Juliet, they didn't get it
Too bad, those kids were so nice
By the time we got back to my pitiful pal
There was no sign of life till he saw the alligator
Purse on her arm, the gleam in her eyes
She opened the bag, there was nothing inside
She said, there's no secret, it's love that I use
I just carry this bag because it matches my shoes
And she said
Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse
Don't call the lady with the alligator purse
Love is the magic of the universe
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse
Love is the magic of the universe
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse
The lady with the alligator purse

Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her Daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'
She snuck out one night
And met me by the front gate
Her Daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
'Cause I was
Thinkin 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' bout a long kiss
Man just gotta get goin'
Where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'
What was I thinkin'
By the county line
The cops were nippn' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through a corn field
What was I thinkin'
Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky-tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'
Oh I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
'Cause I was
Thinkin 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' bout a long kiss
Man just gotta get goin'
Where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'
When a mountain of a man
With a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her Daddy's in a lawn chair
Sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin'
Oh what was I thinkin'
Oh what was I thinkin'
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again
'Cause I was
Thinkin 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' bout a long kiss
Man just gotta get goin'
Where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
Yeah I know what I was feelin
But what was I thinkin', what was I thinkin'
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'
Guess I was thinking about that tank top
Those cutoffs, hahaha

When the white azaleas start blooming
I'll come back to you
When spring's in the air with its freshness so rare
We'll make our dreams come true
When the white azaleas start blooming
Up in those mountains so high
We'll build a nest where we'll find happiness
Sweetheart for only you and I
(When the white azaleas start blooming
I'll come back to you)
When spring's in the air with its freshness so rare
We'll make our dreams come true
When the white azaleas start blooming...
(When the white azaleas start blooming)

I know you can make it in this world on your own
But I wanna take care of you
The woman within may think that it's wrong
But I wanna take care of you
I'll show you the love of a man that knows how
To hold you without holding you down
It's not a sign of weakness to let me be strong
I wanna take care of you
I'll carry the weight of your world on my shoulder
I wanna take care of you
In the prime of our years till time ticks us older
I wanna take care of you
I'll be your rope when that mountain's too steep
Be your hope when the water's too deep
I'll share my blanket when trouble winds turn colder
I wanna take care of you
I've got nothin' to prove but the way that I feel
It's love but it's so much more
For once in my life I know that I am living for
When the good Lord takes you He better take me too
So I can take care of you
When the good Lord takes you He better take me too
So I can take care of you

We walk, we fly, we stay sober, we get high
We sleep all day, stay up all night
Right a wrong, and live our lives
We work, we play, we leave, and we stay
We worry about tomorrow, today
We laugh, cry, cuss and pray
Tryin to matter to somebody
Tryin to get the time of day
Tryin to fit into this crazy world
Somehow, somewhere, someway
And it's all we're all lookin for
It's never too late ya know
To try and matter to the ones that matter most
I've lived, I've learned that bridges don't just burn
Well that's the devil's selfish pride at work
Every chance he gets he'll take his turn
Tryin to matter to somebody
Tryin to get the time of day
Tryin to fit into this crazy world
Somehow, somewhere, someway
And it's all we're all lookin for
It's never too late ya know
To try and matter to the ones that matter most
Tryin to matter to somebody
Tryin to get the time of day
Tryin to fit into this crazy world
Somehow, somewhere, someway
and it's all we're all lookin for
It's never too late ya know
To try and matter to the ones that matter most
It's never too late ya know
Tryin to matter to somebody

She smiled and said if you are who I think you are I'd really like to meet you
I laughed and said if you are what I think you are I'd like to meet you too
She said you've taught me lots of things
But I'll bet there's some things that I could teach you
And though you don't know me I sure know you
Cause you are my childhood hero she said
I got all your records I know all your songs
And I got your picture tacked over my bed
And you know I once wrote you a letter she said
And I don't believe that a night that was spent
By a girl with her childhood hero could ever be wrong
A thousand songs a hundred poems and a half half a fifth of Chivas Regal
While my picture on the wall looked down and winked at me as if the bastard knew
And he listened as she whispered hold me close so I can dream about this later
When you've forgotten me I'll remember you
Cause you are my childhood hero...

We're just a pair of old sneakers
Stringin' each other along
Sometimes i feel just like a heel
'cause i know in my soul, that it's wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
Kickin' each other around
Eight times a week, we play 'hide an' cheat'
'Til we've run that game in the ground
We're just a pair of old sneakers
We know that cheatin' is wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long
We're just a pair of old sneakers
Worn out an' comin' unglued
Both wearin' rings, feelin' ashamed
Tryin' to run from the truth
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And nothin' can tear us apart
Living the lie and lord knows we've tried
To stop walking on each other's heart
We're just a pair of old sneakers
We know that cheatin' is wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long

one traffic light in front of the high school
kids in the parking lot fixing to lie to
an old worn-out deputy, don't even carry a gun
there's a car full of pillbillies looking to score
from one of them trailer court front porch drug stores
and a tired coal miner on a long West Virginia beer run
chorus
dry county blues, not a beer joint in sight
half the county's laid off, laid up or gettin' high
at the head of the holler there's a makeshift casino
with a rusty pool table and blackjack and bingo
ain't nothing illegal as long as the sheriff gets paid
there's good Christian women locking their front doors
praying their daughters don't turn into meth whores
while their sons are out drinkin' and drivin' and trying to get laid
chorus
nowhere to go, not a damn thing to do
so you turn a blind eye, and barely get by
dry county blues

Left my home long ago
To travel up the Tanami Road
So many young fellas were like me
Head full of ideas and pretty keen
I didn't think that anyone would remember me for very long
Lifetime friends are with you 'till the end
They're the ones that know you the best
You laugh about how you were so young and proud
You do that when you've made a lifetime friend
Somehow through the years
Some people that you meet stay near
And even if you're far away
They ring you up just to say
Well how are you goin'
When you comin' back this way
I got a call from you this afternoon
It's been years since I spoke to you
We might of had our blues in the past
But somehow our friendship seems to last
We pick up the conversation
Like we just left it yesterday
Pretty good hey
Neither was my head
It must be intervention or it must be divine
Could be kindness week
Or it could be the wine
Now I pray that you will say yes tonight
'Cause I'm gonna ask if you will be mine

Writer Jesse Winchester
I'm the same old girl that I used to be
I haven't changed at all
I got the same old walk and the same old talk
That would run you up the wall
The same old face and the same old smile and
The same old baby blues
And I'm still doing the rhumba, baby
So I'm still the girl for you
I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
Mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself, it's much bigger than me
If I were you, I'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me
There's lots of girls on the floor tonight
With a lot slicker steps than me
The boogaloo and the funky broadway
Are such a pretty sight to see
My step might be old fashioned
But it's just fine with me
I got a couple of rhumba steps
You might like to see
I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
Mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself, it's much bigger than me
If I were you, I'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me

SHE HATES GOING ANYWHERE IN MY OLD TRUCK
SHE SAYS IT'S ALWAYS MUDDY AND IT RIDES SO ROUGH
AIN'T NO GRACEFUL WAY TO CLIMB UP IN A DRESS
YEAH, I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS
I MIGHT GET HER ON THE LAKE TO FISH WITH ME
IF THE WATER'S SMOOTH AND THE SKY IS BLUE WITH A NICE COOL BREEZE
ANYTHING WE CATCH I'LL HAVE TO CLEAN MYSELF
CAUSE I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS
BUT SHE'LL SLIP OFF A PAIR OF HEELS
WALK BAREFOOT ACROSS THE FIELD
CLIMB UP ON THE FENCE JUST TO BE NEAR ME
SOMETIMES I THINK A HORSE STILL SCARES HER HALF TO DEATH
I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS
SHE LIKES BEING WITHIN SPENDING DISTANCE OF THE MALL
AND HAVING ENOUGH BARS TO MAKE A CELL PHONE CALL
PUT HER IN A CROWD SHE'S RIGHT IN HER ELEMENT
I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS

Well I can see you're advertisin' cause you keep givin' me the eye
It won't take long till your in my song I want to be with you tonight
I've been battlin' needin' bookin's and you the best contract I've known
I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep comin' on
I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow since you have set the stage
Take the key and unlock door let the tiger out of his cage
Just one more big rehearsal another night with you alone
And I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on
Well the introductions over we got our hearts in tune
Let me know before we start the show am I fallin' in love to soon
I got a heart nearly as big as Texas about the size of the astrodome
And I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on
I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow since you have set the stage
Take the key and unlock door let the tiger out of his cage
I don't want no double feature cause my heart just thinks that wrong
But I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on
Yeah I'm a gonna be a hard act to follow if you keep a comin' on

Hey, the dusty Miller,
And his dusty coat,
He will win a shilling,
Or he win a groat
Dusty was the coat,
Dusty was the colour,
Dusty was the kiss
That I gat frae the Miller.
Hey the dusty Miller,
And his dusty sack;
Leeze me on the calling
Fills the dusty peck:
Fills the dusty peck,
Brings the dusty silver
I wad gae my coatie
For the dusty Miller.

hey little mama
don't you take it so hard
they never had the time for you
you wandered in the yard
with magic all around you
and the golden dust of god
you're all grown up,
you've got a baby in your arms
you're all grown up,
you've got a baby in your arms
between the world of the humans
and your expanding heart
you've been holding your own hand
ever since the start
now you're trying to be for somebody
what nobody was for you
did you think that this would be
the hardest thing you'd ever do
did you think that this would be
the hardest thing you'd ever do
but oh, you love her
like you never thought you could
and oh, you love her
like the moon it loves the earth
well
well, oh well
he reminds you of your daddy
with all his tricks and charms
he reminds you of your daddy
every time he lets you down
you believe him when he tell you
he'll stop drinking for you
yeah you think that if you love him
maybe he will change for you
yeah you think that if you love him
maybe he will change for you
hey little mama
don't you take it so hard
the things you are remembering
will surface and depart
and you won't feel so crazy
hanging on a while
and you will give to her
the life that she deserves
and you will give to her
a life that she deserves
'cause oh, you love her
like you never thought you could
and oh, you love her
like the moon it loves the earth
well yeah
oh yeah
the whole world

Every morning the last couple of weeks
In between shaving and brushing my teeth
I'd lean on the sink and practice my lines
By now you would think they'd be memorized
But leave it to me to come all this way
Get down on one knee and forget what to say
I'm at a loss, should have known this is how it would be
'Cause you have that effect on me
I must admit I still don't understand
Why I lose my head holding your hand
There's no explanation, no simple excuse
For this intoxication I feel around you
And now truth be known since I've met you girl
I've been walkin' around in my own little world
One look in my eyes and darlin' any fool could see
That you have that effect on me
You've had your eyes on a two carat ring
I finally went out and I bought it
Right now it's at home sittin' on my TV
Would you believe I forgot it
But you can't blame me 'cause it's plain to see
That you have that effect on me
Yeah, you have that effect on me
Girl, you have that effect on me

I was waltzing by the Ohio, river of dreams,
With the girl of my dreams in my arms
And the music, beautiful music,
Was the breeze through the trees
As the moonlight came over her charms.
We promised to always be faithful and true
But we drifted apart,
Now I'm lonesome and blue
And an other is waltzing by the river of dreams
With the girl of my dreams in his arms.

I'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
We stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me

Cowboys and Indians and trees he could climb
Tomorrow came too fast but he didn't mind
The distance was short so light it again
It don't take no time to get where I am
But one paper kid wasn't really so mean
Just a little bit scarred and a little bit green
And he'd heard of a place it was legal to dream
So he sat with his coffee in a blue Texas wind
And he wrote on a rock
The one paper kid is rollin' again
Driver was drunk or he just didn't see
The future is there it'll happen to me
And all the time that he wasted was his once again
Ah, it never takes long to get where you've been
Broken hearts scattered all over the past
Old bad memories trying to last
Whiskey and women and growing up fast
Fussing and loving and itching like grass
Hell that one paper kid wasn't really so mean
Just a little bit weird cause times were so lean
Now he's gone to a place where it's legal to dream
No camels no coffee no cold morning winds
It was wrote on a rock
The one paper kid is rollin' again

He went to Paris looking for answers
To the questions that bothered him so
He was impressive, young and aggressive
Saving the world on his own
The warm summer breezes and French wine and cheeses
Put his ambitions at bay
Summers and winters scattered like splinters
And four to five years slipped away
He went to England, played the piano
And married an actress named Kim
They had a good life, she was a fine wife
And bore him a young son named Jim
All of the answers to most of the questions
Locked in his attic some day
But he liked the quiet clean country living
And twenty more years skipped away
The war took his baby, the bombs killed his lady
And left him with only one eye
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered
And all he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling
He was recalling the answers that he never found
Hopped on a freighter, skated the ocean
And left England without a sound
Now he lives in the islands, fishes the pilings
And drinking his Green Label each day
Writing his memories, losing his hearing
But he don't care what most people say
After 86 years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile and say
Some of it's magic, some of it's tragic
But I had a good life all the way
He went to Paris looking for answers
To the questions that bothered him so

I walked across the bridge to the island
And sat down in the grass by the old homestead
I listened to the song of the cicadas
And thought about the one whose hair was red
This is where she gave birth to my father
Back when she was just a newly wed
You wouldn't know it looking at this picture
That her eyes were blue, hair was red
You wouldn't know she traveled far and wide
You wouldn't know she lived here all her life
There is so much you'll never know about her
So much left to say that's left unsaid
But I have got this picture in my memory
And her eyes are blue, her hair is red

Roll along, roll on rose of cimarron
Dusty days are gone rose of cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and
Look to see who's standing
Waiting at your window
Watching will they ever show
Can you hear them calling
You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark now
Never see a spark burn bright
Trails that got them home
Kept the names they've known
Four days high and lonely
Coming to you only

I said, "I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston"
I've been thinkin' I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinkin' that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole "nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything
Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pullin' up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinkin', "Who am I kiddin'"
I ain't goin' nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole "nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing that changes everything

For years and years I've rambled
I drank my wine and gambled
But then one day I thought I'd settle down
I met a sweet little lady
And she told me that she'd be my baby
We build a cottage in the old hometown
I can't forget my good old rambling days
Them old freight trains keep calling me always
I may be rough, may be wild
May act tough but it's just my style
'Cause I can't forget my good old rough and rowdy ways
Sometimes when I meet a bounder
Who knew me when I was a rounder
He grabs my hand and he'll say, "Boy, have a drink"
We go down to the poolroom
Get in the gang and then soon
It's broad daylight and I ain't had a wink
I can't forget my good old rambling days
Them old freight trains keep calling me always
May be rough, may be wild
May act tough but it's just my style
'Cause I can't forget my good old rough and rowdy ways

I've seen people everywhere who said they didn't care
If life for them would come to an end and they just sit and stare
I've thought it was a shame I said they were insane
I couldn't see why they wanted to die but I didn't know the pain
I wonder what I'd say if my life turn out that way
I never knew but now I do I lost my love today
I lost my love today I lost my love today
I can't go on my heart is gone I lost my love today

Well, there's a special place in my memory,
Where I keep the pictures of a time an' place I left far behind.
An' I know the years have probably colored the way it really was back
Then.
But still, I like to take the memories out an' look at 'em from time to
Time.
There's a full moon t'night, on the prarie, a memory just rode into
View.
A boy, a buckskin, an' an ole spangler dawg, in the hills where the blue
Bonnets grew.
Well I was deep in the heart of Texas, just a kid 'bout 13 at the time.
Runnin' wild through the mesquite, the cedars and cactus.
It's been years, but your still on my mind.
No matter where I might wander, there's a memeory that I'll never lose.
The lonestar shines bright, in my heart tonight
I've got the blue bonnet blues
Well I remember those warm summer evenin's, playin' out under the stars.
Back then I never dreamed we'd be leavin', but I guess things just don't
Stay as they are.
Well the years and the miles came between us, but t'night as I'm
Dreamin' of you.
Once again, I'm a kid, in the sweet arms of texas...
And I've got the blue bonnet blues.
No matter where I might wander, there's a memory that I'll never lose.
'Cause the lonestar shines bright in my heart t'night.
I've got the blue bonnet blues.
The lonestar shines bright in my heart t'night
I've got the blue bonnet blues

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
She never hollers coo coo till the fourth day of July
Gonna build me log cabin
On a mountain so high
So I can see Willie as he goes on by
Well, I've played cards in Texas
And I've played cards in Maine
Oh, I'll bet you five dollars I'll beat you next game
Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds
Oh, I know you of old
You robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey
Oh, I know you of old
You robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold
Sometimes I feel much younger
Sometimes I feel so old
Sometimes the warm sun shines
Sometimes it's dreadful cold
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
How I wish she was mine
She never drinks water she only drinks wine
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
She never hollers coo coo till the fourth day of July

I love you but I can? t remember why
Stars fallin? from high forgotten sky
I was a one-line wonder in my own love song
I keep a little journal by my bed
Dreams help me find the words I haven? t said
Like when a little girlie said goodbye to me
From behind a screen door
I won? t see her again I? m sure
Didn? t I say I need you
I tried to move on but I can? t
I tried to think of bad times
Good memories are all I have
I love you but I can? t remember why
I? d love to find a reason to deny
I was a one-hit wonder in my own hometown
And I guess I might have made a few mistakes
But maybe that? s exactly what it takes
To get a little happy in this big sad world
How many have you made
And which of those have you laid on down to die
Well didn? t I say I need you
I tried to move on but I can? t
I tried to think of bad times
Good memories are all I have

Fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feeling good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
Struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflecting off the cars
And dreaming of a white limozeen
She wants to have a white limozeen
Well, the days to come were long and dark
And the nights were hard and cold
She met the devil in the City of Angels
But she never lost her soul
She kept her dreams close to her heart
Like a family photograph
She cried sometimes and died sometimes
But still she knows how to laugh
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
White limozeen
White limozeen
Now she's really ridin' high
She's a woman of the world
But deep inside she never changed
She's the same old down home girl
And when the airplane brings the kinfolk
To visit for awhile
There's a friendly guy in a red bow tie
To take 'em around in style
He drives 'em in a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
She was fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feelin' good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
She goes struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflectin' off the cars
And dreamin' of a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Oh, ridin' in a white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen

I've always said "I do" too easy,
And now I'm payin' the price.
A weakness for beautiful women
Is my most expensive vice.
I still believe in matrimony,
But I can't afford another try.
Child support and alimony
Is just about to bleed me dry.
I've got ex's all across the country
And I owe everybody in town.
I've got bill collectors callin' me up
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house,
But I don't belong in there.
I've got so many ex's and owe so much,
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares,
Yeah I ought to be on Hollywood Squares.
Lookin' back over my love life,
I only have myself to blame.
I guess I should've checked the price tag
Before I gave 'em my last name.
Now my credit ratin's in the gutter,
And the bottom line sure looks bad.
I'll be payin' the rest of my life
For the few good times I've had.
I've got ex's all across the country
And I owe everybody in town.
I've got bill collectors callin' me up
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house,
But I don't belong in there.
I've got so many ex's and owe so much,
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares,
Yeah they ought to put me on Hollywood Squares.

She called me up this morning,
She said there's some thing you should know
There's a job back home in Boston
And I think I'm gonna go
My parents are in Cambridge
And I've got some old friends there
Now I know you think this isn't fair
And the tears started falling
There was nothing I could say
Even if I fight it someone loses either way
Oh it might as well be China
Or the dark side of the moon
There's no way I can be there
Every Friday afternoon
I have him every weekend
He's got his own room here
He's all that's kept me going
These last three years
There's little league in Boston
Oh but how will coach his team
How's he gonna grow-up with out me
And the tears started falling
There was nothing I could say
Even if I fight it someone loses either way
Oh it might as well be China
Or the dark side of the moon
There's no way I can be there
Every Friday afternoon
What about Christmas
If I can't get off of work,
What about his birthday,
If I'm not there he'll be hurt
And I know the day is coming,
When she'll find someone new
But he'll never love him, like I do
Well it might as well be China
Or the dark side of the moon
There's no way I can be there every Friday
Afternoon

Hush a bye my baby slumber time is coming soon
Rest your head upon my breast while mommie hums a tune
The sandman is calling when shadows are falling
While the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by
Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody
When I was a little feller on my mommie's knee
The old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
[ guitar ]
Hush a bye my baby go to sleep on mommie's knee
Journey back to Dixie Land in dreams again with me
It seems like your mommie was there once again
And the old folks were strumming that same old refrain
Way down in Missouri where I learned this lullaby
When the stars were blinking and the moon was standing high
And I hear mommie clove as in days long ago singing hush a bye singing hush a bye

If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by saying
Look under your bed, there's a Skoal can and a Playboy
No one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah I know you really liked her
And it just don't seem fair
But I'll I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare
And oh, you got so much going for you
Going right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you
But still you feel like there's
A knife sticking out of your back
And you wondering if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and 8th
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridget
Make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right
And you should really thank Ms. Brinkman
She spent so much extra time
It like she sees the diamond underneath
And she's polishing you till you shine
And oh you got so much going for you
Going right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally
But you're staying home instead
Because if you fail Algebra
Mom and Dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me
You got so much up ahead
You'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by saying have no fear
These are nowhere near
The best years of your life
I guess I'll see you in the mirror
When you're a grown man
P.S. go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can
And oh you got so much going for you
Going right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish
I wish you'd take a typing class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be
I'd say have a little faith and you'll see
If I could write a letter to me
To me

Sometimes I'm battle weary
I forget to use my shield
The arrows pierce my armor
And I stumble in the filed
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
I'll think my life is over
But the Lord he comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And he sets me on my feet
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
Sometimes your battle weary
But the war's already won
Keep your head and hold your shield high
'Til your days of life are done
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

Take this bread, taked this bread, taste and you'll never be lonely

Designer names and diamond rings, are just some of the finer things
I thought it took to keep her satisfied
But a bank account and credit cards, a circle drive through an acre yard
Couldn't feel that lonesome feeling, that she had inside
I bought her fancy clothes, for all occasions
And that new car so she could go just any ole where she pleased
I bought the golden band she wore, on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Leaving early and stayin out late, I thought for sure her love would wait
Until the day that I could find the time
But all the things that she expected, were all the things that I neglected
What she wanted from me would not have cost a dime
I bought her fancy clothes, for all occasions
And that new car so she could go just any ole where she pleased
I bought the golden band she wore, on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me

Now I was just a girl of two
Now I was just a girl of two
With a golden heart and a button shoe
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
There was something wrong with the butcher's boy
Was something wrong with the butcher's boy
He trembled in his hand and voice
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The others knew to let him be
But the devil had a hold of me
Now the tailpipe spit and the engine roared
The tailpipe spit and the engine roared
I's waving out the Plymouth door
And the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The old folks saw the last they'd see
The devil had a hold of me
I dreamed last night that my time was done
I dreamed last night that my time was done
And my soul flew up to the holy son
But the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I snapped back down when he pulled my lead
The devil had a hold of me
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
Until you feel that touch upon your sleeve
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me

Buenos noches senorita, I'm mighty pleased to meet ya
Maybe you and I could sit a spell and talk
I'm new to Santa Fe, I just rode into town today
Thought I'd spend some time in these adobe walls
It's dark in this cantina, it's a wonder that I seen ya
Sittin' without any company at all
I was wondering if we might dance away this lonely night
Like two shadows on these old adobe walls
I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
As I take you in my arms and hold you close
Though I don't understand a word you're saying
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know
These walls have stood for ages and though time still turns its pages
Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
Sure as there are stars above we're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls
I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
As I take you in my arms and hold you close
Though I don't understand a word you're saying
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know
These walls have stood for ages
And though time still turns its pages
Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
As sure as there are stars above
We're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls
As sure as there are stars above
We're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls

Though you've gone away
I play your favorite song
In the blue and gold
With your dark glasses on
I always think I see you
Across the avenue
Walking by where I lost you
It's all I ever do
You just walked away
We'll meet tonight, Ok
Going against the light
Run down in front of me
I always think I see you
Across the avenue
Some day I'll come to meet you
On the other side
Across the avenue
Across the avenue
Though you've gone away
I wear your favorite shirt
Sitting in the sun
By the library lines
I always think I see you
Across the avenue
Some day I'll come to meet you
On the other side
Across the avenue
Across the avenue
Across the avenue
Across the avenue

In a town where you can sum up every girl with just one sentence
Give or take the subject or the verb
She shows up like the devil said penance
Won't nothin' ever be clear no more
She got hired on down at the last chance diner
She works all the same shifts as me
I've never been one for too much conversation
But now I choose my words so carefully
'Cause the angle of her cheek is the math of persuasion
First time you saw the ocean, she's got tucked behind her knee
She is swallowing lightning and she is spittin' thunder
Waftin' California, reekin' Tennessee
She is waftin' California and reekin' Tennessee
Now I wanna tell her how I feel
But each time that I start
My tongue wraps like a tether ball
Six times around my heart and I say
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Ferguson
It's Cory from work callin' to say
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Ferguson
I was wonderin' what you were doing, a little later on today
Just wonderin' what you were doing, a little later on today
Now I'm curious to see just where them 8 pounds will end up
I wanna be around to watch the southern kick in
Ain't got no purple heart, no blue ribbon
Blow out them candles now I'll show you where i've been
Now she comes around at midnight like a Sunday afternoon
With a purpose and a manner like a needle and a spoon
A bad thing waitin' 'round to happen like a lake of gasoline
The way that woman does me is like nothing, I've ever seen
Now I wanna tell her how I feel
But each time that I start
My tongue wraps like a tether ball
Six times around my heart and I say
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Ferguson
It's Cory from work, callin' to say
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Ferguson
I was wonderin' what she was doing, a little later on today
Just wonderin' what she was doing, a little later on today
Don't think I'll ever wake up on the wrong side of her bed
She brings the sun, she brings the shine
These days every time I try and start to sing some sad song
I open up my mouth and the only word that I can find is just
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Ferguson
It's Cory from work, callin' to say
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Ferguson
I was wonderin' what she was doing, a little later on today
Just wonderin' what she was doing, a little later on today
I ain't even thinkin' about the rest of the day
I was wonderin' what she was doing, a little later on today
I said hey, hey, Miss Ferguson, it's me

You say you love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Running through the fields of daisies, wading through the creek
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show and the joy that a bluebird brings
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
There's just something bout the morning that make each day a joy to see
The nighttime brings a peaceful feeling that rests inside of me
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine

Lullaby and good night
Dream sweet dreams of love and light
In your heart
In your hands
You are more than your desires or your demands
And if you feel you can't keep hold
Just let them go
Through the days
Through the years
Through the laughter and the tears
You will grieve
You will grow
You'll be more than anyone will ever know
And when you feel this can't be true
I'll help you through
So when you feel you're on your own
Got nowhere to go
Turn yourself around; seek my shoulder
And when you feel you're on the ropes
Close to losing hope
I will hold you closer
Lullaby and good night
Dream sweet dreams of love and light
You are strong
You are whole
You are more than anyone will ever know
And when you feel this can't be true
I'm here for you
So if you think you're on your own
Got nowhere to go
Turn yourself around; seek my shoulder
And when you feel you're on the ropes
Close to losing hope
I will hold you closer
Lullaby and good night.....

Don't you look pretty
Dressed to the nines
Comfortably sitting
On your gold mine
Blood red and blonde
Lipstick and curls
A high-heeled don Juan
Come to mess up my world
All of the ladies
Are watching their backs
The boys thinking maybe
They might stand a chance
Bet every bar you walk in's the same
They don't know who you are
But they sure know your name
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone
Why'd you come calling
On this side of town
A woman who's fallen
And keeps going down
I won't compete with your dirty work
So get back to the street
Before you get hurt
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone
This southern belle is tough as nails
Leave mine alone

She placed her ring on the sill,
Dishes piled high
She's on the front porch step
And the air smells like snow
She's thinking of the siege to come
And how she'll miss those weekends
In the park with the sun on her face
And her book by her side and that
Lingering taste that he left on her tongue
He lifts his glass from the table
It leaves a ring where it stood
He sees the light from the window
Caress her like he knows he should
He's remembering the first time he kissed her
And how he'd wake
And immediately he'd miss her,
Like a spell, with each breath,
He'd taste her breath like a haunting,
Irritating as hell
Do you remember when you'd pray
To never see the day
When someone would make you feel this way
'Cause you knew
They would cut right through you
And once inside, you were afraid they'd find
Nothing to hold on to
He puts her ring on her finger,
She brushes back his hair
He takes a sip from his glass,
She inhales the cold fall air
And they're thinking of the long road ahead
And the strength that they will need
Just to reach the end
And there in the silence they search for
The balance between this fear that they feel
And a love that has graced their lives

In a cafe just off I-65 I seen a man
And a woman and a baby child
They were laughing,
Smiled at me when they went to pay
And the way she was talking
About her two little girls
That they were all headed
Down to Disney World
When she broke out the pictures
That was all I could take
Get a little too close to home
And I'm so far from you
Yeah I'm so far from you,
Too close to home
And I'd come back to you
When there's ever good reason to
At a rest stop just off 40 East
I pulled out to get some sleep
I seen some little kids
Were playing some ball
I woke up when a fly ball hit my hood
A little kid on the playground
Hit it too good
I said enough's enough
I had to give you a call
Get a little too close to home
And I'm so far from you
Yeah I'm so far from you
Too close to home
And I'd come back to you
When there's ever good reason to
Too close to home
?
Everywhere I look I see
Something else reminding me
I don't really have to be alone
It's hitting too close to home
And I'm so far from you
Yeah I'm so far from you
Too close to home
And I'd come back to you
When there's ever good reason to
Hitting too close to home
Too close to home
Too close to home
Too close to home

In my high school we separate the rich from the rest
Those who wear rags and those who only wear the best
And in my high school the hold assemblies for the football team
But never for the kids with different dreams
(1st chorus)
We've got jocks and we've got smokers
Rednecks and jokers
There's a category for us all
And we stuggle with out homework our teachers and their rules
Yeah, they think we're just adolescent fools
In my high school there's some who think they're tough as they can be
But when I look in their eyes all I see is insecurity
And in my high school there's some who will wait
And then there's some who won't
Some that cross those lines and some that don't
(2nd chorus)
We've got outcasts and we've got rebels
Mostly saints, sometimes devils
You see them walkin' up and down the hall
As they stuggle with their boyriends their girlfriends their math
And they long for the bell that gets them out of class...in my high school
(bridge)
We laugh, we cry, we fall, we fly.
And sometimes we wonder why we're even here
We pass, we fail and only time will tell
If we'll ever make it though these teenage years
In my high school there's some who study for their entrance exams
Some just want to play guitar in some rock 'n roll band
And in my high school the seniors just can't wait for June
They don't realize that we grow up way too soon

Well, I can't forget the day we met how I could clearly see
With picture-perfect vision, she was the only one for me
My perception of a heavenly love was right there in my sight
I never saw the true writin' on the wall, 'cause she was standin' in my light
Bought her a diamond ring; nearly everything this workin' man could not afford
A Chevy, a house, and the credit cards to her favorite department stores
Loved her all I could; I can't believe she would run off with some ol' used to be
Guess ya never know what the future holds, 'cause for her it wasn't me
[Chorus]
And they say lookin' back is a lesson, and that's why I won't forget her
Through the smoke and haze of bein' burned, I can see things a whole lot better
Lord, I was blind, but now I find since she did me down and dirty
Hindsight's not twenty-twenty, it's more like a 30-30
Now I'm pickin' up the pieces of this shattered, broken heart of mine
Been searchin' for the lovin' parts, but the hurtin' ones are all I find
When she took her aim, she wasn't playin' no games
Lord, she dropped me right to my knees
She untied our knot with a perfect shot and put me into my misery
[Chorus]
Lord, hindsight's not twenty-twenty, it's more like a 30-30

I dreamed mama walked up the heavenly stairs
And medals for mothers were given up there
They mentioned the million things mom did for me
Things I took for granted and never could see
If there's medals for mothers
For all of the deeds they have done
If there's medals for mothers
Mama you'll win everyone
A medal of honor was pinned on her
There a medal for patience and kind loving care
A medal for duty she won up above
But the biggest of all was the one for her love
If there's medals [unverified]
Mama you'll win everyone

Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down

Way back in the mountains
Way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer
They called him Fiddlin' Will
He could play most anything
And some say he could sing
But the one thing that he liked to do best
Was sawing on the strings
So, get out the fiddle
And rosin up the bow
Look at ol' Will a-pattin' his toe
We'll make music till the rafters ring
All that pickin' and a sawin' on the string
When the neighbors had a shindig
And they all had vittles to eat
We'd always have to wait on Will
To make the frolic complete
When he comes down from the mountain
All the gals began to sway
Sometimes he'd pick that ol' five-string
Until the break of day
So tune up the five-string
Tighten up the hide
Tell all the hill folks to get inside
All them pickin' and a-sawing on the string

Thirty nine candles burnt out on a cake
Each representing a million mistakes
The last one still burns, there's a wish I can make
This time I'm getting it right
So I close my eyes and I take a deep breath
And I promise myself in the time I have left
[Chorus]
I'm gonna work like I don't need the money
I'm gonna laugh like I'm not afraid to cry
I'm gonna dance like nobody's watching
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
Loving me hasn't been easy on you
I don't know why, but I know you still do
It may be my day, but here's a present for you
You're looking at your new man
He's sincere and sober and faithful and kind
And he's home when you need him and girl starting tonight
[Chorus]
No more excuses and no more me doing things wrong
Life is too short, baby, I've wasted ours for too long
And baby from now on
[Chorus]
I'm gonna work like I don't need the money I know I am
I'm gonna laugh like I'm not afraid to cry laugh laugh laugh
I'm gonna dance like nobody's watching I'm gonna dance I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
While I still got the time

If there's someone out there their heart is filled with doubt
If they standing in the shadow and the candles blows out
And the devil is there with you, he's got you in his hold
You think you're no match for him but don't surrender your soul
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
When you're down for the count just call out His name
If he's got you in his grip, oh, remember this one thing
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
There I was, all alone fearing for my life
There was darkness all around me on that lonely night
When the devil made a move, he got a hold of me
Then I called out for help and the Lord set me free
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
When you're down for the count just call out His name
If he's got you in his grip, oh, remember this one thing
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring

Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows, in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for what's to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place, beside the ones that never fade
Shes strong and fragile, weak and smart
Whatever the cost she plays the part
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more.

The cuckoo clock quit chirping
The bird fell out and died
Spent its whole life working
And never learned to fly
It ran out of time
A man jumped in the river
To wash away his sin
In his religious fervor
Forgot he couldn't swim
No one saved his skin
Believe you me
I want to believe in you
Believe you me
I want to believe I do
A woman works the corner
Of Hollywood and Vine
No one can afford her
But we stand in line
Cause her love is blind

The fairest bloom the mountain know
Is not an iris or a wild rose
But the little flower of which I'll tell
Known as the brave agony bell
Just a simple flower so small and plain
With a pearly hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds sing when they see it bloom
For they know that spring is coming soon
Well it makes its home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies deep on the windy hills
And it tells the world "why should i wait
This ice and snow is gonna melt away"
And so I'll sing that yellow bird's song
For the troubled times will soon be gone

She blew into this old one horse town
Like something we ain't never seen
And old Bill hired her at the Sundown Grill
She tied that apron 'round her jeans
I started hanging out there every night
Just to hear her talk and laugh
I couldn't help but fall in love with her
I should've known it wouldn't last
She always talked about Mexico
I never thought that she would really go
I felt my love could make her settle down
I guess I know better now
She's probably living down there by the sea
I wonder if she ever thinks of me
One morning she was gone like the wind
She won't be back this way again
Old Bill could tell that I was missing her
As he poured me a drink
Said, "If you put a wild bird in a cage
You'll break its will to sing"
If that's true then she's better off
Still out there wild and free
So I bought straight tequila all around
Said,"Boy, here's to her memory"
She always talked about Mexico
I never thought that she would really go
I felt my love could make her settle down
I guess I know better now
She's probably living down there by the sea
I wonder if she ever thinks of me
One morning she was gone like the wind
She won't be back this way again
She won't be back this way again
She won't be back this way again
Oh back this way again, back this way again

She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the crackerjack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
'N drive around in my truck with no place to go
But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
A real desire, does she know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire
She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood
And someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train
And someday's she only wants a break
Hey but she wants what she wants, but man I know I know I know
She needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
A real desire, does she know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire
Yeah, feel that fire
So as long as there's a breath to take
A smile to share, a prayer to pray
A chance to hold her hand to fan the flame
She's gonna feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
A real desire, does she know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire
Oh feel that fire
She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the crackerjack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo

There was a little ship and she sailed upon the sea
And she went by the name of the Merry Golden Tree
And she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
And she sailed upon the lonesome sea
There was a little sailor unto his captain said
Oh captain, captain what'll you give to me
If I sink them in the low and lonesome low
If I sink them in the lonesome sea
Two hundred dollars I will give unto thee
And my oldest daughter I'll wed unto you
If you sink them in the low and lonesome low
If you sink them in the lonesome sea
He bowed upon his breast and away swim he
Till he came the ship of the Turkish Reveille
As she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As she sailed upon the lonesome sea
If it wasn't for the love of your daughter and your men
I would do unto you as I did unto them
I would sink you in the low and lonesome low
I would sink you in the lonesome sea
He bowed his head and down sank he
Farewell, farewell to the Merry Golden Tree
For I'm sinking in the low and lonesome low
For I'm sinking in the lonesome sea

When you're feeling lonely, lost and let down
Seems like those dark skies are following you around
And life's just one big shade of gray
You wonder if you'll see the light of day
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
I've heard it said that this too shall pass
Good times or bad times, neither one lasts
But thinking that your luck won't ever change
Is like thinking it won't ever stop once it starts to rain
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
Yeah, there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds

In the back of the bottom drawer
Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends
That I have always kept
But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces from my past
That I shouldn't have to share
A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it
That didn't quite rhyme
But it made me cry
In a Dear Jane letter
From a different guy
He broke up with me
And he told me I'm not always right
And a stolen key
From an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer
I don't keep these things
'Cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I wanna stay
Right where I'm at
I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't wanna mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff
A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in
Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '98
We danced all night, stayed out so late
We thought we were stars
Closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap
But still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer
I'm not trying to hide these things
From the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him
Thanks to my yesterday
So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue
Fight the urge to say
'It's my way or no way at all'
And now I cherish love a whole lot more
'Cause of what's
In the back of the bottom drawer

Muddy water coming out of the sink in there
And dirty sheets up on the bed
I can't get no picture on the TV screen
I can't stand the ones up in my head
I got the air turned down to very cold
But it ain't doing a bit of good
It ain't like there was a first resort
In this last chance for gas neighborhood
I was looking for freedom
I was looking for a good time
I was looking for a little space
A little place that was mine, all mine
I was going with my change of heart
Wanted no part of forever
I was looking for a blessing
When I said baby it's all for the better
Yeah, what do you know
I think I wound up where she told me to go
Of all the places man I broke down here
Shade tree mechanic told me son
I can't get no parts for this here make in here
But don't worry boy I'll get it done
Meanwhile I need to be back with her yesterday
Clock in this town don't seem to care
I'm finding fast this Godforsaken place
Is at least two weeks from everywhere
I was looking for freedom
I was looking for a good time
I was looking for a little space
A little place, some peace of mind
I was going with my change of heart
Wanted no part of forever
I was looking for a blessing
When I said baby it's all for the better
Yeah, what do you know
I think I wound up where she told me to go
This place ain't on no map
But how was I to know it's everywhere that she ain't at
How did she know that I'd wind up where she told me to go
Where she told me to go
Muddy water coming out of the sink in there

Boot flask full of Jack
Nobody'd look, nobody'd ask
Holding out on a ten o'clock twelve-pack
Win or lose, it didn't matter
'Cause soon as those jerseys hit the field
You know that's when it got real
With the rivalry's and ride-with-me's
And let-me-know-where-you're-gonna-be's
At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling go Big Blue
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers cigarette
Stain on my lips from cowboy red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
T8 still on her cheek
Party in a field, she danced with me
That pull you close, bottled up all week
Win or lose, it didn't matter
At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling go Big Blue
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers cigarette
Stain on my lips from cowboy red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
We had those bragging rights to all those Friday nights
The stadium lights, those stadium lights
At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling go Big Blue
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Stain on my lips from cowboy red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
Yeah, they're still falling in love at the home game

The dissonant bells of the sea
Who are ringing the rhymes of the deep
As they sing of the ages asleep
Not so near or so far
And the old masters wind of the waves
Sped forth for the free men and slaves
Whispers of secrets it saves
And about whom they are
And the workings of sunshine and rain
And the visions they paint that remain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a Spanish guitar
The beggar whom sits in the street
On his miserable throne of defeat
Envisions no wealth there to meet
Thinking nowhere is far
And the laughter of children employed
By the fantasies not yet destroyed
By the dogmas of those they avoid
Knowing not what they are
And the right and the wrong and insane
And the answers they cannot explain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a Spanish guitar
To play on a Spanish guitar
With the sun shining down where you are
Skipping and singing a bar
From the music around
Just to laugh through the columns of trees
To soar like a seagull in breeze
To stand in the rain if you please
Or to never be found

Yeah, I was always the lazy one, a Southern Californian
But I've got some kinfolk on the Mason-Dixon line
So this summer just for fun, hopped in my DeLorean
And headed for my uncle's farm for a short time
I thought that I would be huntin' and fishin'
I misunderstood him somehow
So far there's nothin' but chores here to mention
I didn't mind feedin the sows
But how do you milk a cow?
How do you milk a cow?
I wasn't in FFA
This cow must think I'm crazy
Up under it this way
I'm sittin' here a pullin'
But there ain't nothin' comin' out
Oh, E I E I O, how do you milk a cow?
Yeah, I love it here in Tennessee but these farmers all make fun of me
Can't haul much hay in a tiny sports car
So I got myself a 4 wheel drive, learned to spotlight deer at night
And I've got shearin' sheep right down to an art
One thing's for sure, I hate shovelin' manure
It gets all over my overalls
Them horses need shoein', I hear Bessie mooin'
So I thought maybe I'd ask you all
How do you milk a cow?
How do you milk a cow?
I think it's safe to say
A man could get arrested for this in L.A.
This Heifer must be empty
'Cause she ain't puttin' out
Oh, E I E I O
Tell me, how do you milk a cow
{This song is absolutely an udder disaster
I hope I don't get mad cow diease}
How do you milk a cow?
I no longer care
I'm gettin sick
And tired of smellin' dairy air
I'm headin' back to Cali
And I'm turnin' in my plow
Oh, E I E I O, how do you milk a cow?

All this time I've searched for you
Down every road I've travelled
I wove a thousand fantasies
But each one came unravelled
You've haunted places in my mind
Where no one else has been
And now our paths have led us
To a love that has no end
Anywhere with you
Is where I want to be
Anywhere will do
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Anywhere with you
The dream that filled my lonely nights
Is finally unfoldin'
And given me someone to share
The love that my heart's holdin'
As years turn into memories
Our love will still remain
Till the moment passes forever
My heart will call your name
Anywhere with you
Is where I want to be
Anywhere will do
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Is where I want to be
Anywhere will do
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you

I apologize
I should've kept it hidden
Under wraps and out of sight
At least in the beginning
But I wanted you to see
What you meant to me
Turns out that wasn't smart
A sleeve is no place for a heart
Wish I could take back
the secret that I told you
But it's too late for that
Now you know the whole truth
Three stupid little words
You never should have heard
But I let down my guard
A sleeve is no place for a heart
Take one last look before it's gone
It's time I put it back where it belongs
Next time I will know
Not to let my feelings show
I'll keep them in the dark
A sleeve is no place for a heart

I'm gonna head down to the coast
Where nothing ever seems to matter
You know I love it there the most
When every piece of my world gets scattered
Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
And I wrote you this little note
And I never even sent the letter
But I still want you to know
I found a place I feel a whole lot better
With blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
I'm gonna leave my old winter coat
And I won't even need a sweater
I'm gonna sit out on a boat
'Cause it's time for some sunny weather
And blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
In my hair
Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
And the wind blowing in my hair

Love makes the world go around love makes the wolrd go around
Sometimes up (and sometimes down) but love makes the world go around
When it comes right down to it you just gotta go do it
'Cause love is a thing that just won't wait
Sometimes it can spite ye or just right up and bite ye
And sometimes go up right in your face
Love makes the world...
(The first time that you feel it your first thought is to steal it
And run under a rock somewhere and hide
But once that you've been smitten you can't keep it hidden
Or it just might teach you a polite)
Love makes the world...
Sometimes up and sometimes down but love makes the world go around

He's just leadin' you on honey he'll be gone
Before the ring on your finger turns green
Your new love is the playboy kind he's not looking for the ties that bind
He'll leave you with a tortured mind before the ring on your finger turns green
He's just leadin' you...
He's fickle cheap and phoney too just like the ring he gave to you
I know cause I've been through it too when the ring on my finger turned green
He's just leadin' you...
Before the ring on your finger turns green

She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows we'd love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watched her bloom as the years roll by
And to me there'll never be another
I'll love her 'til the day I die
Oh in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more to me
Oh I know you often wonder
So I'll tell you the reason why
She's my rose of old Kentucky
And I know she'll never lie

This porch light
I can keep it on all night
I can stay up til the birds fly
But every minute's like a year
I got it bad
It ain't going away
I've gotta have it
I don't mean to sound dramatic
But I'm going crazy over here
I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Yeah, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
I'm thirsty
And I could start
This night off early
And drink until
The TV's blurry
Cause I got plenty of beer
But that won't fix me
You're the only one that hits me
One shot of you it always kicks me
Into another gear
You know, I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Yeah, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Hey, hey, alright
Oh, oh, ooo, woo
Wherever you are
Girl it's too damn far
Cause if you ain't in my arms
Oh, you know I'm Jonesin'
I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Yeah, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Oh, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Hey, hey, alright
Oh, oh, ooo, woo
That's right
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin'

(Lee Fikes)
I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most, them Opery stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee
Milwaukee's where we were before we came here
Working in a brewery, making the finest beer
She came to me on a payday night, said
"Let's go to Tennessee," so we came down to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opery
We turned on the TV, Porter Wagoner was singing loud
I said that's the man for me, I love him, there's no doubt
I'm leaving now see if I can find out where he's at
And if I can't find him, I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt

A high roller even when the chips are down
To win her over, I'd seen the tables turn around
She's ten the hard way, I can feel it in my bones
She'll be makin' my day and not another night alone
'Til it's time for a windfall and not a single moment too soon
I've been too long overdue, now I'm gonna shoot the moon
I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line
I've been to the table, and I've lost it all before
I'm willin' and able, always comin' back for more
Squeezin' out a thin dime 'til there's no one hanging on my arm
I've gambled on a third time, a fool will tell you it's a charm
If I'm bettin' on a loser, I'm gonna have a devil to pay
But it's the only game I know to play, it doesn't matter anyway

Oh the grass is green
Everywhere but under me
Or so it seems
I got a wedding band
In the name of a wandering man
I love the best I can
Oh Henry, have you got something to tell me?
'Cause everybody's been sayin'
You been runnin' around
Oh Henry, I know you wouldn't hurt me
Don't you know that we don't need
One more grave in this town
Boy if you're smart
You know you'll only have my heart
'Til death do us part
Oh you and I both know
That at the end of forbidden road
There's a six-foot hole
Oh Henry, have you got something to tell me?
'Cause everybody's been sayin'
You been runnin' around
Oh Henry, I know you wouldn't hurt me
Don't you know that we don't need
One more grave in this town
When we wed, we said forever ever and a day
The whole town heard you promise to be true
So boy you're gonna only give your gypsy heart to me
If it's the last thing you do, ooo ooh ooh oh woah ooh ooh
Oh Henry, have you got something to tell me?
'Cause everybody's been sayin'
You been runnin' around
Oh Henry, I know you wouldn't hurt me
Don't you know that we don't need
One more grave in this town
Oh one more grave in this town

A drift of wild turkeys
In the field across the way.
I'm standing, staring, waiting
For those coyotes to make a play
But they never do.
So I move on.
A pack of wild children
In the field across the street
I'm standing, staring, waiting
For the bell to set them free
But it never does.
So I move on.
51 years, a child upon the Earth,
Trying to find the answers
Without digging in the dirt
So I'll never know.
And I'll move on.

Young lovers in a picture frame
Ever notice how there ain't no rain
Nobody hangs hard times on the wall
You won't see it in an 8 by 10
But there's a storm every now and then
A slamming door down the hall
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
But it's worth fighting for (it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is war
An old couple on a front porch swing
On a walk down memory lane
Been through the fire and back again
Through the clear and the cloudy skies
Still love in each other's eyes
Sometimes love is war but sometimes you win
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
And it's worth fighting for (yeah, it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is war
Sometimes love is all that can save us
Sometimes love can kill a man
Yeah sometimes love is a soft touch
Or a pistol in your hand
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
But it's worth fighting for (it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is
Baby, sometimes love is war

Now, I've got a pony, the fastest thing around,
And of all the girls I've known she's the truest one I've found.
Well, she'll cut 'em and she'll head 'em just the way you want 'em
Turned,
And if you drop your loop around 'em, she can make a grass rope hum,
And any time you got a rodeo, and I've got the entry fee,
You can bet your boots my gal and I will come.
Chorus
Whoopee-ti-d-idi-ido on the plains of colorado
That young pony was born to work the trail.
Some old idaho rawhider was the first one tried to ride her,
Bronco buster, wild horse rustler, well she flipped him off like a
Turkey feather duster.
Now, some folks like a cadillac with power brakes and air,
Just give me a hamlee saddle and my little buckskin mare.
Well, I rode her up a mountain when we made that summer drive,
And I [g]took her to wyomin? for a rodeo or two,
At old cheyenne and saratoga, we roped them little dogies,
She the best ole gal this cowboy ever knew.
When she gets to old to rodeo too old to ride the range,
I'll take the buckskin lady out across the open plains.
Cause she's just an ole cow pony and I know she'd go plum crazy
If she had to stand unsaddled around the barn the whole day through
I'll just turn her loose to ramble underneath them rocky mountains
And tell 'em that her workin? days are through.
Chorus
Whoopee-ti-d-idi-ido on the plains of colorado,
That's my pony sir and I say she ain't for sale.

If I give my love to you girl, will I get love in return?
Or will I just get a fire, for as long as it will burn
I'm not looking for a lover, I don't even want a friend
I want this to last forever, and forever never ends
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes
While saying that you need me
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair
If you don't love me
If this is just a game, well honey I don't think I really care to play
I've trusted you before, babe and you always let me down
I came back to you believing, I was more than just a clown
You say it will be different, this time your love is real
Honey don't make me believe you, if that ain't the way you feel
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes
While saying that you need me
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair
If you don't love me
If this is just a game, well honey I don't think I really care to play

All the things that I denied saying everyone had lied
That I could never ever do these things to you
I confess now that you're gone they were right I did you wrong
And all the lies you've heard about me are true
It was easy at the start to fool your trusting heart
But I didn't think I'd end up losing you
So let my mistakes be known now that you are really gone
And all the lies you've heard about me are true
[ steel ]
It was easy at the start...

Sweet Angeline I hope nobody ever hurts you Angeline
You're still a child but I can see the woman fighting to bust out
And take you far away from me sweet Angeline
Sweet Angeline you're young and free
Don't ever let nobody get inside your mind
Until you get too blind to see sweet Angeline
Angeline don't let nobody tell you that your dad don't love you
And your mother Angeline sweet Angeline Angeline
Angeline don't let nobody tell you that your dad don't love you
And your mother Angeline sweet Angeline
Angeline

AT THE TIME
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY JEAN SHPEARD AND BY LYNN ANDERSON
I told him that I loved him cause I loved him at the time
And I told him that I didn't want any other lips touchin' mine
I whispered love your kisses are sweeter than the wine
But I'd never tasted champagne at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had filet mignon peanut butter taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
When I found you I started hearing pretty music I'd never heard
And quietly when we spoke of love it was like I'd learned a brand new word
I once thought I'd seen everything but till I met you I was blind
And I wonder now was I even born at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had a T-bone steak saltine crackers taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
If you've never been to Paris France Big Spring Texas will suit you fine
And that's the way I was when I loved him at the time

I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
City folks got worries,
A country boy's got none
All I wanna be is the daddy of a farmer's son
Subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly.
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I get finished plowin'
I'm gonna go to the pond
And take my sweet baby
And have some good clean fun
You gotta work, that's a pity
I'm gonna be a hillbilly.
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I die, throw me a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn
Let me lie in state
Plant me under that oak tree
I wanna be a hillbilly
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
Subdivisions are silly
I wanna be a hillbilly.

Girl, I recognize the smoke in your eyes
I've seen it in mine too
We both had been burned, hard lessons learned
From making some bad moves
We keep looking for the perfect time and place
Good things don't always come to those who wait
Sometimes you got to make your own fate
If there ever was a moment that felt so right
This is one tonight
If there ever was a reason to hold on tight
This is one tonight
We've been beatin' 'round the bush
We've been bidin' our time
We've been searching the skies
For a heavenly sign
But if you're looking for a love
That's the keepin' kind
This one tonight
I've spent too many nights
Wishing that I could say what I'm saying
Moments like this should be lost in a kiss
And not in debating
We got nothing to lose but precious time
Sooner or later gotta lay it on the line
Roll the dice and put your hand in mine
If there ever was a moment that felt so right
This is one tonight
If there ever was a reason to hold on tight
This is one tonight
We've been beatin' 'round the bush
We've been bidin' our time
We've been searching the skies
For a heavenly sign
But if you're looking for a love
That's the keepin' kind
This is one tonight
We've been beatin' 'round the bush
We've been bidin' our time
We've been searching the skies
For a heavenly sign
But if you're looking for a love
That's the keepin' kind
This is one tonight, this is one tonight

Have you ever wondered what life would be like
If you only went left instead of taking that right
If you had waited just ten more minutes
To leave the house, would it all be different?
Every decision, everything we choose
Has a consequence whether we win or lose
Nobody knows that any better than me
I left her standing at the station, with a ticket and a dream
She's the train that I didn't take
The big commitment I just couldn't make
For fear of breaking my heart,
I didn't risk the ride
Yeah, she's the lesson I learned the hard way
Now being lonely is the price I pay
The river of regret runs deep and wide...
Here on the safe side
I still remember the night she left
She said she didn't want to lose me
But she had to find herself
I coulda stopped her or got on board with her
But now it's too late to reconsider
She's the train that I didn't take
The big commitment I just couldn't make
For fear of breaking my heart,
I didn't risk the ride
Yeah, she's the lesson I learned the hard way
Now being lonely is the price I pay
The river of regret runs deep and wide...
Here on the safe side
Sometimes the greatest risk of all is never taking one at all
She's the train that I didn't take
The big commitment I just couldn't make
For fear of breaking my heart,
I didn't risk that ride
Yeah, she's the lesson I learned the hard way
Now being lonely is the price I pay
The river of regret runs deep and wide...
Here on the safe side
Oh, I don't want to be alone
(Here on the safe side...)

I know you don't like me
Don't like the things I do
The saddest part just might be
That I don't like you too
You think you know my story
Well maybe you did for a little while
I guess that's the way it goes sometimes
Between a mother and a child
All my life you've reminded me
How you struggled nine long months
Your achin' back and your swollen feet
How you almost lost me once
You say you gave up everything
All the dreams you had
Told us kids we're the only reason
You stayed there with our dad
And you want me to cry for you
You want me to feel the way you do
I'm sorry your life let you down
But the fault it is not mine
It's not supposed to be like this
Between a mother and a child
You want me to just agree
With everything you say
Call my dad the bad guy
Make him pay and pay and pay
It's really not my business
It never was or will ever be
But I know nobody's perfect
And that's counting you and me
Yeah that's counting you and me
I don't remember all that happened
Mama I was just a kid
But if it really was all that bad
Why do you wish I did?
You want me to cry for you
I'll never feel the way you do
I'm sorry your life let you down
But the fault it is not mine
It's not supposed to be this way
Between a mother and a child
Oh a mother and a child
You're my mother and I'm your child

I feel the hunger you feel in your touch burning my body and soul
And it's frightening just wanting somebody so much so close to losing control
But darling don't make me surrender too soon I'm so afraid of the fall
Please give it time to be tender and pretend it won't hurt at all
Slowly be gentle each step of the way I've never been loved before
Let me believe that you won't turn away after you've opened the door
But darling don't make me...
Please give it time to be tender and pretend it won't hurt at all

I wanna get back
I wanna get square
I wanna get back on the hopes and dreams that I had
That the good lord above us can spare
Like that actor said
I don't wanna lose heart
I don't wanna get beat beat down by the big big world
I'll quit before I even start.
Lord, I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
I just want my words to be true (I just want my words)
I want my soul to feel brand new
I wanna hold hands
Yeah, and I wanna make love
And I wanna keep running all day, and all night
Even when my mind tell my body "that's enough"
And I wanna stand up
Yeah, and I wanna stand tall
If I ever have a son, if I ever have a daughter
I don't wanna tell them that I didn't give my all
And I just wan my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
I just want my words to be true (I just want my words)
I want my soul to feel brand, brand new
Like a fresh coat of paint
We could make it anything but blue
Anything but blue
Now, when your dreams start saying
"I can't come true, you'd be better off without me"
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
I don't wanna go broke
Not from one bad deal
I don't wanna be up all night crying in my hands for a girl
That isn't even real
Lord, I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my words to be true (I just want my words to be true)
And I just want my song to be true (Just want my song to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my words to be true (I just want my words to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my song to be true (Just want my song to be true)
And I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
I want my soul to feel brand new
I want my soul to feel brand new

Took a walk in my neighborhood
Two in the morning
By the Skytrain Station
The streets were full of junkies and homeless
And they all wanted something
They all wanted something
And what am I supposed to do?
There are too many of you
Too many of you
Yeah, sometimes look you in the eye
Say that, "I too am human, I could easily be here"
Although we all hover between apathy and compassion
We fill up all our days with so much distraction
What makes it easier and to see what we don't want to
But we all live here
We all live here
We all live, don't we?

Come through ol' Nashville come through a flyin'
Studded bout my little darlin' couldn't keep from cryin'
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ fiddle ]
Goin' to Atlanta just to look around if things don't soothe me goin' on another town
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ dobro ]
Workin' on the railroad savin' all I can loojkin' for that woman ain't got no man
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ banjo ]
Standin' on the corner ten thousand miles from home
Studded bout them good times done past and gone
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ fiddle ]
If I was a railroad man burnin' all of the time
So I can hear a lonehorn when she goes rollin' by
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go

(Dolly Parton)
She's been there, God knows, she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she know how to
Dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her around and round
You can keep her in you vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

There's been times I've let my faith run thin
Not been the man I should have been
After all the trouble I've been in, I'da gave up on me
I've lived hard and I've lived fast
Lost things I will never get back
Cause someone to look past all of that
God must really love me
When I look at the miracles around me
At the way that I live and the way He forgives
I know He's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I'm still alive is
God must really love me
Wake up and feel you by my side
The perfect girl, the perfect time
And see the way our future shines
God must really love me
When I look at the miracles around me
At the dream that I live and the gift that he gives
I know he's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I get to live this life is God must really love me

Casanova broke ya
Just like china
He was smooth as southern Blue Bell Cream
?Cept he never meant to share that diamond ring
So you take up to the roof-top, pining
Aim to touch the moon a' golden white
Lord, the air is damp, the stars are teary eyed
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
From the ballroom you can hear them laughing
Pretty maidens and your own Don Jaun
And ya tell yourself
They?ll miss you when you?re gone
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
Cross yourself, by Jesus
Now your head is all a blur
Questions don?t come easier
Answers, they get longer
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone

The moment these lips said I'm leaving
I felt in my heart I was wrong
But I told myself I might as well
Since I already spent nights alone
I thought I had put it behind me
Guess that's why I'm so surprised
That my heart started a-racing
When I ran into you tonight
I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
But darling, only a fool
Would take one more chance with you
There was a good reason why
I had to tell you goodbye
But I can't pretend
It's not love that I'm in
'Cause I'm feeling that feeling again
Now I'm lying here like I used to
Lonesome as a young widowed bride
And just like the old days, before I went my way
A question is burning inside
Were we made for each other
To walk through the fire hand in hand
Well, I'll never know for certain
But I'm feeling that feeling again
I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
But darling, only a fool
Would take one more chance with you

They've read the scriptures, they've passed the plate
They've sung the anthem, they've passed the plate
And we're both prayin' he don't preach late
But he's gettin' amens, that's just our luck
It's eighty five degrees outside and he's just gettin' warmed up
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
Well it's been rainin' all week long
Woke up this mornin', dark clouds were gone
We both been raised not to miss church
But on a day like today heaven knows how much it hurts
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
See that sunlight shinin' through that stained glass
How much longer is this gonna last
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday

(Dolly Parton)
Raindrops tumble to the ground
Making puddles all around
Drops of rain that look like tears
Fall on my window pane
Raindrops seem to harmonize
With teardrops falling from my eyes
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that cannot wash away the pain
Sometimes without knowing it
I touch my face and find it wet
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
I can't face the fact that
I am not important in your life
Once you lived for rollin' me
And then your feelings changed
There's just no gettin' over you
I try so hard, but it's no use
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Raindrops just keep falling down
Beatin' out their rhythmic sounds
Dancin' as they play their sweet refrain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that just won't wash away the pain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain

I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
Just a sittin' on this front porch
All the big time I'll ever need
I'll buy you a ticket to the big time
Might need a loan but that ain't nothin' new
Buy you a ticket to the big time
Might need a loan but that ain't nothin' new
They say I can't afford the big time?
Baby I'll just write an IOU
There ain't no one in the big time
That hangs out the laundry like you do
There ain't no one in the big time
That hangs out the laundry like you do
I'm a-having myself a big time
Just watching you rub and scrub the whole day through
I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
Just a-sittin' on this front porch
All the big time I'll ever need
Just a-sittin' on this front porch
All the big time I'll ever need

I'm weary and tired I've done my day's ridin'
Nighttime is rolling my way
The sky's all on fire and the light's slowly fadin'
Peaceful and still ends the day
And out on the trail, the night birds are callin'
Singin' their wild melody
Down in the canyon, the cottonwood whispers
A song of Wyoming for me
I've wandered around the town and the city
Tried to figure the how and the why
I've stopped all my schemin'
I'm just driftin' and dreamin' and watching the river roll by
And here comes that big ole prairie moon risin'
Shinin' down bright as can be
And up on the hill there's a coyote singin'
A song of Wyoming for me
Well now it's whiskey and tobacco and bitter black coffee
A lonesome old doggie am I
Waking up on the range, Lord, I feel like an angel
Free like I almost could fly
Drift like a cloud out over the badlands
Sing like a bird in the tree
The wind through the sage sounds like Heaven singin'
A song of Wyoming for me
A song of Wyoming for me

I wandered again to my home in the mountains,
Where in life's early dawn I was happy and free,
I looked for my friends but I never could find 'em,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Chorus
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
No Mother or Dad not a friend could I see,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
They've all moved away said the voice of a stranger,
To a beautiful home by the bright Crystal Sea,
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in Heaven,
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Repeat Chorus

Our daddy's won the war and came home to our moms
They gave them so much love that all us kids were born
We all grew up on Mickey Mouse and hula-hoops
Then we all bought BMW's and brand new pickup trucks
And we watched John Kennedy die one afternoon
Kids of the baby boom
It was a time of new prosperity in the USA
All the fortunate offsprings never had to pay
We had sympathy for the devil and the Rolling Stones
Then we got a little older, we found Haggard and Jones
A generation screaming for more room
Kids of the baby boom
Kids of the baby boom, we had freedom, we had money
Baby boom, here in the land of milk and honey
Counting our chickens way too soon
Kids of the baby boom
Now we all can run computers and we all can dance
We all have Calvin Klein written on our underpants
And at six-o'clock, like robots, we turn on the news
Watch those third world countries deal out more abuse
Remember the first man on the moon
Kids of the baby boom
Kids of the baby boom, we had freedom, we had money
Baby boom, here in the land of milk and honey
Counting our chickens way too soon
Kids of the baby boom
As our lives become a capsule they send to the stars
And our children look at us like we came from Mars
As the farms disappear and the sky turns black
We're a nation full of takers, never giving back
We never stop to think what we consume
Kids of the baby boom
Kids of the baby boom, we had freedom, we had money
Baby boom, here in the land of milk and honey
Counting our chickens way too soon
Kids of the baby boom
Our optimism mingles with the doom
Kids of the baby boom

When my eyes behold the stars
This heart of mine is filled with wonder
My poor mind cannot grasp their array
But the hand that spilled them there
All across the wide heaven
Had a plan when He placed them that way
[Chorus]
Known only to Him
Are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him
In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely heavy cross I must bear?
Then He tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trust worthy
He gives me strength far more than my share
[Chorus]

Don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lyin'
If you really don't mean it, I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buyin'
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?
Yeah baby, I'm begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then don't call me
I dont' mind a little smoke gettin' in my eyes
Baby, take your hands, take your lies
And lay 'em on me
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do
Well don't worry about the damage done,
Just let those words roll of your tongue
Even if you're lyin'
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do
Say you do
Just say you do
Girl I'm, begging you
Just say you do

The girl's wouldn't look anything like they do
Can't imagine my life without dresses and shoes
Or never taking a sunset from a front porch swing
Or make any sense of the pleasure love brings
I'd been alone for sure
Had it not been you
I wouldn't reach for your arms
When my dreams don't come true
Never sit holding hands
On a crowded church pew
I wouldn't smile when my fingers run through your hair
Or laugh when we race to the top of the stairs
I'd get old for sure
Had it not been you
You know there are times
That I can't wait to pick up the phone
When you're callin'
And the three little voices
That always chime in right along
When we're talkin'
Oh I never would see through
eyes of truth
And my heart
would have overlooked
a view that some just talk of
and never find
In a lifetime
It's hard to describe
in just words how I feel
when I hold stand beside you
But I make it known
It's just time that I kill
When I'm alone and without you
I will love all through the night
If you love me
As long as I wake up each morning
I'll know I'm the only one around
For a lifetime
I'd never have taken in a sunset from the front porch swing
Or make any sense of the pleasure love brings
I'd been alone for sure
Had it not been you

The prisons are empty
The homeless have houses
Nobody's hungry
Nobody''s poor
Nobody's judged by their faith or their color
Nobody's wrong in this world without war
We buried our swords
We don't fight anymore
[Chorus]
You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Nobody's lonely, used, or neglected
Children are cherished from the day that they're born
Even a stranger's never a stranger
No bars on the windows
No locks on our doors
Cuz we open our doors
Not afraid anymore
[Chorus]
Just think of how much better off we'd be
If we open up our hearts
If we believe
You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Ohhhhh
If we loved
If we loved
If we loved a little harder

You step out the shower, wrapped up in a towel
Take your hairbrush mic, start taking requests
You smile and say baby, do you think that I'm crazy?
I just laugh and say yes
Crazy 'bout horses and wrap around porches
Crazy 'bout Strait singing fool hearted memory
Crazy 'bout waking up, four A.M. making love
Then falling right back asleep
Yeah, you're crazy, the same kind of crazy as me
We're late for the party
You're back where you started
Changing your clothes for the thirteenth time
I say you look amazing
You say, no I look crazy
I smile and say maybe you're right
Crazy 'bout horses and wrap around porches
Crazy 'bout Strait singing fool hearted memory
Crazy 'bout waking up, four A.M. making love
Then falling right back asleep
Yeah, you're crazy, the same kind of crazy as me
Ah ooh
You give me a kiss in the light of the moon
Ah ooh
Then you whisper, you know you're crazy too
Crazy 'bout horses and wrap around porches
Crazy 'bout Strait singing damn near anything
Crazy 'bout waking up, four A.M. making love
Then falling right back asleep
Yeah, you're crazy, the same kind of crazy as me
The same kind of crazy as me (ah ooh)
Yeah, baby, you're crazy as me (ah ooh)
The same kind of crazy (the same kind of crazy)
(You're crazy) you're crazy
(You're crazy) you're crazy
(You're crazy as me) ah ooh
Ooh
Hoo

You tell me some days you wake up and you don't believe
Let's go climb the mountain if that's what it takes you to see
How far together we have come
Through days of rain and days of sun
It's all around you
Above and below you
Everywhere you go
It's all around you
Never ever doubt it
'Cause you never are without my love
If you need to see me cry I'll fill the ocean blue
If you need, really need to see me bleed I'll open up for you
But if you only need reminding
Let my smile ease your mind, 'cause
Trouble follows trouble
If trouble's all you choose to see
But faith just brings you more faith
We can make all the love we need, 'cause

Better watch your step
Better watch your step
You'll be puttin' my heart on hold
Better hold your breath
Better hold your breath
You'll be jumpin' in deep hot water
Better watch your step
Better watch your step
Better not go changin' your mind
Better look at yourself
Better look at yourself
You'll be puttin' my heart on hold

Every day I clock out
And head straight to her house
We cuddle up on the couch
But it always ends the same ole way
I'm drivin' home and it's incredibly late
Somethin's got to change, ?cause
I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day, and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm takin' him to dinner Sunday night
I've never been so nervous in my life
I want to do this right, ?cause
I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day, and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
Yes sir I love her very much
I know it's only been seven months
But that's long enough
I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day, and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

Passion in the backseat, parked out in the cane
Ever since the first time, I ain't ever been the same
I gave up on baseball and I threw down my glove
I discovered girls and I got into love
Me and my friend Aldo, he's the one who had the car
We made all the dances, we made all the bars
Told each other secrets and we wore each others clothes
One night I stole his woman and I wonder if he knows
Sleep all day, run all night
Chasing the ladies 'cause we knew they might
We raised a lot of hell, we made a lot of noise
Everybody knew, we were Bayou boys
Everybody knew, we were Bayou boys
Sweet, Marie was dangerous with those dark seductive eyes
She had me sayin', 'maybe, baby' before I realized
She loved me so deeply and I tried to hold on
But changin' don't come easy when you've been this way so, lo

He was wipin' motor oil off her dipstick
She was pullin' on the hair that got caught in her lipstick
And with the smell of her perfume he forgot the smell of gasoline
As he was toppin' off her tank she said, "How far to Abilene?"
He sees 'em come
He sees 'em go
From the island of his
Two pump Texaco
There's a rusted out Rambler up on the rack
And a pile of bald Goodyear's out in the back
He meets families on vacation, bikers and businessmen
He calls 'em "friend" but he'll probably never see 'em again
No he won't
He sees 'em come
He sees 'em go
From the island of his
Two pump Texaco
He keeps 'em moving
On down the road
Come back real soon
To his two pump Texaco
He's heard about those big city shop-n-go stations
With twenty automated self-service machines
He just feels sorry for them big city people
They must not know what service really means
He's got a sign that says
Last chance stop for at least two hundred miles
Maps, gas, soda pop,
Lucky Strikes and Moon Pies
Yeah, he's a third generation filler-up, full service man
He thanks the Lord for that "star" in the sky
And the grease on his hands
Yeah he does
He sees 'em come
He sees 'em go
From the island of his
Two pump Texaco
It's like a place we used to know
Come back real soon
To his two pump Texaco

(Dolly Parton)
He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring

Another lonely motel room another lonely night
I gotta ride on a bronc called Certain Doom and I need to show 85
Money's tight and mornings are rough cause at night I toss and turn
Thinkin' I should change my course and head on home to here
And I'm wonderin' if I'm broken down
Thinkin' I should turn around
Pick up my belongings and go home
But there's something I feel down inside
Must be damned old foolish pride
And the dream of ridin' some day in the Dome
Keeps me comin' back each time
Me and my crazy old mesquite cowboy mind
Another 7-second ride just a second shy of the rent
She's searching through the mail at home for the check I never sent
Lately I've been gettin' thrown landin' hard and tastin' dirt
But it's not broken bones it's a broken heart that's causin' me to hurt

The other day I walked out on the street I happened to see
A pretty young woman a little bitty boy and he looked back at me
See the big man cry mama that's what I heard him say
See the big man cry mama he looks like his heart will break
I followed them to the pup shop window the little boy stopped to see
He looked up at her said if I had a daddy he'd buy that puppy for me
See the big man cry mama
I wanted to tell him I was his dad and he sure had a pretty mom
But the judge had said I could never see them for the things I've said and done
See the big man cry mama
Son as you'll grow older you'll find someone who is dear
Just stick by her take care of her and you will never hear
See the big man cry mama

Seems like almost everyday
Trouble carries us away
And sometimes when we hurt we all need to be saved
Every time I'm in to deep
Someone always rescue me
Its like heavens sending down the help that I need
Life like a chain sometimes it breaks
We all need a hand when we fall from grace
It could be someone walking down the street
A stranger on a bus
A little kid on his way to school or any one of us
We all got a little superman ready to take a fly
And save a life ohh save a life
Take a look around and you'll see ordinary angels
The world can make you feel so small
Steal your dreams and make you crawl
And break you till you got you got nothing at all
When your in that dark place and you need that embrace
You know love is never to far away
It could be a waitress at coffee shop you never saw before
A soldier that's just coming home from fighting in the war
We all got a little superman ready to take a fly
And save a life ohh save a life
Take a look around and you'll see ordinary angels

[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas is two gold front teeth
(What?)
Two gold front teeth
With a diamond in each
I'd be a G if I could have two front teeth
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas
It's Christmas
And I'm toothless
(Ho ho)
I got a cap in my grill that's ruthless
(Ho ho)
I need a dentist that's both a driller and a jeweler
(Ho ho)
I'm lookin' for a look that's just a little bit cooler
(Ho ho)
I don't want toys I don't want any money
(Ho ho)
I want my carats in my mouth of Bugs Bunny
(Ho ho)
This year the only thing on my list
Is two teeth to match the watch on my wrist
[Chorus]
When someone says "Yo wazzup dog?"
I'll say: "You know I'm doin my plug fizzle
(Right on)
A real OG like ODB
My record sales will triple."
[Chorus]
I'd be like Pimp Dracula
The Spetacula
Cledus T. will be Stone Cold Makea
Here I go again with my funky alter ego
(Ho ho)
Making people laugh is the best gift I know
(Ho ho)
Better wrap it up put it underneath the tree
(Ho ho)
I want a million dollar smile like Master be
(Ho ho)
I'll keep them shinin' like the doves on my duly(sp?)
(Ho ho)
Santa Claus won't you please bring him to me
[Chorus: x2]
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas

Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro
Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown
Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro
Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes so brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown
Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro
Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

Baby I know I've told you
But I ain't told you today
Since you walked in with that sleepy eyed grin
There's something I've been meaning to say
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you
When you pencil in all your makeup
When you're rubbing it off at night
Getting out of them jeans while you're giggling at me
Ain't no mistaking I
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you
Lying on the very next pillow
Smiling like you do
Sharing your deepest secrets
Baby I'm telling you
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you
When you fall asleep in front of the TV
When you're cryin' over some sad book
When you beg and plead to go fishin' with me
And I have to bait your hook
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you
Lying on the very next pillow
Smiling like you do
Sharing your deepest secrets
Baby I'm telling you
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you
Lying on the very next pillow
Smiling like you do
Sharing your deepest secrets
Baby I'm telling you
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you
I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you

Barney works down at the A & P
He drives a baby blue A.M.C.
Ain't missed of day of work in 13 years
He's a fire department volunteer
He's got a yard that's always just been mowed
Collected stamps since he was 10 years old
You've never seen a more regular guy
But when the sun goes down on Friday night
Chorus:
Slaps on his Hai Karate after shave
Puts on his Elvis jacket custom-made
Gets in his patent leather zebra boots
Fires up his super sport Malibu
He burns the rubber 'cross the county line
A honky tonkin' fool till closing time
You ought to see him metamorphosize
From Barney Jekyll into Bubba Hyde
Monday morning it's a suit and tie
Attention shoppers there's a two-for-one buy
Tuesday afternoon he mans the wheel
Makes his round in the bookmobile
He's got a Wednesday night canasta game
Thursday's the tourney at the bowling lanes
His friends would freak out if they only knew
The party animal he turns into
Chorus
You oughta see him metamorphosize

If you're feeling lonely
And think you're the only one
Left that's alone in a bar
If you need somebody
With shoulders to cry on
Well, baby, I'm not very far
Just look for my name on a jukebox
When you're tired of being alone
Put in a dime
And I'll take the time
To sing you a sad country song
If you started drinkin'
And still can't stop thinkin'
About all those all nights alone
If teardrops start fallin'
And you keep on callin'
To find out there's nobody home
Just look for my name on a jukebox
When you're tired of being alone
Put in a dime
And I'll take the time
I'll sing you a sad country song

[ Bill ]
The night was black the roads were icy snow was fallin' drips were high
And I was weary from my drivin' so I stopped to rest for a while
I sat down at a truck stop I was thinkin' about my past
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
Gone at last (gone at last) gone at last (gone at last)
Gone at last (gone at last) gone at last (gone at last)
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
[ dobro ]
[ Mary Lou ]
Well I ain't dumb I kicked around some I have thought too easily
But that boy looked so deductive he just grabbed my sympathy
Sweet little woman what's your problem tell me why you're so down cast
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
Gone at last...
[ dobro ]
[ Bill ]
Once in awhile from out of nowhere at least expected and we ran to pair
Somebody will come and lift you higher and your burdens will be shared
[ Mary Lou ]
I do believe if I hadn't met you I might still be sinking fast
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
[ Both ]
Gone at last...
But I pray it's gone at last

Three fingers whiskey pleasures a drinker
But moving does more than that drinking for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers say moving's the closest thing to being free
He rosined his riggin he laid back his wages he's dead cert on ridin' the big rodeos
My woman's tight with an overdue baby and Willy keeps yelling hey big boy let's go
Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther ready rolled from the same makins as me
And I reckon we'll ramble till hell freeze us over Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
Ladies we surely will take up your pleasures
But I've got to worn you there never will be
A single soul living can put brand or handle on Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
Well they dance on the mountains and they shout in the canyons
They swarm it ain't loose herd like the wild buffalos
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles and tellin' us stuff that we already know
Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther...
I reckon we'll ramble till hell freeze us over Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Well I never once
Backed down from a punch
Well I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast
A bully's just that
You've got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye
As bad as it hurt, I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again.
Scared me to death
When you took your first steps
And I'd fall every time you fell down
Your first day of school, I cried like a fool
And I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry, when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man
And as strong as I am
Sometimes its hard to believe
That one little girl, with little blonde curls
Could totally terrify me
If you were to ask
My wife would just laugh
She'd say "I know all about men
How when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again"
Well I know one day, I'll give you away
And I'm gonna stand there and smile
And when I get home, and I'm all alone
Well, I'll sit in your room for a while
Well I didn't cry when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
When tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again.

How long is forever how soon is now or never
How long will these heartaches linger on and how long will my baby be gone
How wide is an ocean how deep is a devotion
How long do these sleepless nights go on and how long will my baby be gone
For I could never understand how she could turn to another man
How much does a heart ache how deep is a heartbreak
How long do these sleepless nights go on and how long will my baby be gone
For I could never understand...

(Porter Wagoner)
You're gentle body lying here so close to me
As you move your hand slowly across my face
You're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
What a love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
Like the love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
What a love in the way I see you

We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
Just my brother and me
The night before he shipped out overseas
A leather-neck, jarhead marine
He said "the radiator leaks,
And the timing-belt is worn,
But the heart and soul of this old beat up truck,
Is the dashboard."
"it's seen alot of tan legs,
Got a kick ass radio
Heard alot of singing along with some country songs, and rock and roll.
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad,
Alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photo graphs."
He said "if I don't come back,
You can have this ford,
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard."
He said "the paint is peeling off,
It's got dents in both the doors,
If something happens to me don't hang a for-sale sign above the dashboard."
"it's seen alot of tan legs,
Got a kick ass radio
Heard alot of singing along with some country songs, and rock and roll.
Got a thirty eight bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad,
Alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photo graphs."
He said "if I don't come back,
You can have this ford,
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard."
I had the engine overhauled,
A paint-job and brand new chrome
I had her washed and waxed, sittin' in the drive the day that he came home
I said "here's the keys,
She's all yours,
I fixed everything,
But the dashboard"

Writers screamin'
Phones ringin'
Secretary's sayin' that the mailman's bringin' me
A stack of see's
And assists.
Man I'm gettin' sick and tired of this.
Cause all I did was take a hit song.
Swear I didn't know it
When I re wrote it
That I was doin' any thing wrong.
Well, if Phil Vassar's
Mad at me
Well, it's just another day in parodies.
There's no song that's safe from me.
Well, make sure.
We'll see.
But I don't get any loyalty
Still I ask my label
Pretty please,
Ooh, for just another day in parodies.
I'm a big star
New cars
Never thought I'd take a joke this far after CMA's
I sat beside
Garth Brooks and his ex-wife.
But lately
It seems like
I catch hell for every song I write
Funny videos
I've done a few
Makin' people laugh's all I want to do.
But last night I had a bad dream.
CMT banned me
GAC canned me
They won't play no more comedy.
Well, lawsuits
Legal E's,
It's just another day in parodies.
Well, there's nothin else
I can really sing.
I'll take one of Faith's,
Two of Tim's.
I've always had great love for them.
That's my very own
Recipe
Ooh, for just another day in parodies.
Well if Shania Twain's
Mad at me
It's just another day in parodies.
But deep down
She wants to be Cledus T.
Cha-ching
Cha-ching.
I wish the cash register would ring.
Oh, I bet that Al
Would agree
Ooh, It's just another day in parodies.
Just another day in parodies.
("Oh, no. I'm not mad at you Cledus. You look nice. Nice hair, I like that. Ha,ha,ha")

TWO TEARDROPS
(Bill Anderson - Steve Wariner)
'99 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she'd just gotten married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell by the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea
The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be life-long companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there callin' her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea
Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday there'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure for a moment of pain
And they drift on down and ride to the sea again
Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
Old man sittin' not ten feet away just lost his wife said to me
You've got brand new angel and I lost mine
I guess the Good Lord giveth and the Good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a tear drop from our face
Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are part of the pleasure and part of the pain
Till they drift on down and ride to the sea again
Two teardrops floatin' down the river
Two teardrops floatin' down the river

We both said some things I know we never meant,
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went.
If I know you, you're probably wonderin' what to do.
You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good, if I know you.
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart,
Forgettin' if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart.
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said.
Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed.
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.

Can you not see what you've done?
You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone, but you did.
I can still hear the song,
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong, I was right so I walked away,
And left you there, alone
I got so tired of talkin' on the telephone,
How many times would we say the words goodbye
I made mistakes, and one was telling you that I'd be there,
When telling time had come,
I should've said I didn't care.
Oh, the time I would have saved,
If I had been less willing to accommodate,
You'd been a little less likely to cry.
You go back to the high life,
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known, but now I know
There'll be no word from you,
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.
The way you cut the rope,
That kept you dangling from such pitiful amounts of hope
I would have cut it too.

Way Back home where the cypress grew
In a clapboard shack on the black bayou
Live a woman and a man that I call Mom and Dad
And Times were hard and times were tough
We barely had nothing' but we didn't need much
Except for the love of a woman and a man
Daddy worked his fingers to the bone
But I know my momma was the reason he was strong
[Chorus]
Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds don't sprout and the crops won't grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when you're living in a house that you don't own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a woman and a man
Well, I grew up working like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand
You see, the only thing that matters money can't buy
And when it gets down the bottom line
It's the love you find between a woman and a man
Everything Daddy said to me was true
Cause my life was not complete until I found you
[Chorus: x2]
Only thing in life that stands
Is the love between a woman and a man

Ready, Willing And Able
( written by Jess Leary / Jody Alan Sweet )
Blue moon is rising, all hope seems gone
A heart can be lonely only so long
Baby don't worry 'cause somebody cares
Just call out my name and I'll be right there
(Chorus)
If you need a shoulder strong enough to lean on
If you need a hand that fits like a glove
If you need a heart then hold on steady
'Cause I'm ready, willing and able to love
I know you're wary, you've been hurt before
But it's time to move on, girl, and close that old door
Open your heart, wipe those tears from your eyes
You've got my number, don't even think twice
(Repeat chorus)
Now you think it's over, my offer still stands
And if you're still uncertain, I'll say it again
(Repeat chorus)
Yes, I'm ready, willing and able to love

Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey barroom mirror on the wall
Go stare at someone else
Don't show the world the fool I am
Just keep it to yourself
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Dance floor seems you're underneath my feet
Everywhere I turn
I oughta waltz right out of them swingin' doors
But that's a step I just can't learn

[Chorus]
They both know a man in trouble when they see one
And they're both willing to listen when he talks
Anger and depression, tearful confessions
Jesus and bartenders hear it all
Jesus and bartenders hear it all
Well, they hear things that men don't tell their wives
Sinful secrets whiskey brings to light
One man offers comfort from the cross
The other only comfort on the rocks
[Chorus]
But if you're at the end of your rope
Either one will serve you, but just one offers hope

Trying not to love you,falling in every way
With you around I keep losing around day by day
Trying to be fair both to me and to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
I guess there's no use hiding
What everybody knows
'Cause to other eyes there's no disguise
For the love that shows
If I'm not being clear I'll explain these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
I guess there's no use hiding
What everybody knows
'Cause to other eyes there's no disguise
For the love that shows
If I'm not being clear I'll explain these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do

Sometimes a careless word just rolls right off my tongue
Now matter what I do it leaves you all undone
Hey baby no need to go crazy over some little something I've said
Can't you see you're the keeper of my heart
Even when I lose my head
We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away
Sometimes the whisper of love gets lost in the angry shout
Even hearts that are in this deep might think about an easy way out
One honest touch makes those worries just fade like stars at dawn
These occasional moments of weakness
Only makes our love more strong
We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away
It gets easier all the time
Oh and harder and harder to leave behind
We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away

How Can You Buy Killarny / An Irish Lullaby
This little song I use to sing to my lad whose in the crowd tonight I'm going to embarrass him now when he was only a baby he is now 20 yrs old
An American landed on Erin's green isle
He gazed on killarny with a rapturous smile
How can I buy it he said to the guy
I'll tell you how with a smile he replied
How can you buy all the stars in the sky
How can you buy two Blue Irish eyes
When you can purchase a fine mothers heart
Then you can buy killarny
Nature restore on her guilt's with a smile
Me and Rose the shamrock and the barley
When you can buy all those wonderful things
Then you can buy killarny
Over in Killarny, Many years ago,
there's a song my mother sang to me
in a voice so sweet and low.
Just a simple Irish ditty,
in her sweet ould fashion way,
and I'd give the world if I could hear
that song of hers today.
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Hush, now don't you cry!
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
That's an Irish lullaby.

Hold my hand let's not lose my way hold my hand and lead me home
Guide each step that I might take hold my hand and keep me strong
And let the path I walk be straight let the deeds I do be kind
Let me never hesitate to help my brother walking blind
Hold my hand...
And let my words have meaning of anything that I might speak
If you see me leaning on just hold my hand and straighten me
Hold my hand...
Amen

Likely as not, there's been better weather
I feel real sure there's been better times.
Right here tonight, with you all around me
I'm so glad right now is mine.
So honey, tonight, make it alright.
Turn on your smile for me for a while
Take me away from where I have been.
I know you love me,
But love me over again.
You have the way of filling my emotions
Till there's not a word left in my mind.
Times get so hard, so confusing
You make now a so-much better time.
So honey, tonight, make it alright.
Turn on your smile for me for a while
Take me away from where I have been.
I know you love me,
But love me over again.

I'm fallin' head over heels for him
He's callin' me twice a night then callin' again
When I talk he likes to listen
He says I'm the one he's been missin'
Somebody tell me he isn't
[Chorus]
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye
Lookin' for another heart to break
Maybe I'm too cautious for my own good
Maybe he's the real deal knock on wood
All I know is he'll be here in a minute
I hope it's love and I hope he's in it
I'll be over my limit with
[Chorus]
This better be somethin' more
I want to be sure that I'm not fallin'
I'm not fallin' for
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for a
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for another heart
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for another
Heart to break

You, you wanna stay
Baby, I wish you would go
Please don't make it so hard on me
It tears me to pieces you know
We were no good together
We settle like oil and water
I, I just wanna smile again
But you wanna drown in the bottle
And I can already see what our life would be
Life would be
Yeah, it plays out in my mind like a tragedy
It's not pretty you see
So let me go gracefully
And I can already see what our life would be
Life would be
Yeah, it plays out in my mind like a tragedy
It's not pretty you see
So let me go gracefully
Only with a vision of me
From when we were in love
Yeah, we were on fire
We're on fire
Yeah, it plays out in my mind like a tragedy
It's not pretty you see
So let me go gracefully
Oh, let me go gracefully
Let me go gracefully

We are miners,
Hard rock miners,
To the shaft house we must go,
Our bottles on our shoulders,
We are marching to the slope.
On the line boys,
On the line boys,
Drill your holes and stand in line,
â??Till the shift boss comes to tell you,
You must drill her out on top
Can't you feel the rock dust in your lungs,
It will cut down a miner when he is still young,
Two years and the silicosis takes hold,
And I feel like I'm dying,
From mining for gold
Yes, I feel like I'm dying,
From mining for gold.

I taught him how to talk to me
I showed him what a woman needs
A hand just to hold in the dark
He used to think it was enough
Sending flowers to show love
Now he knows he's gotta open his heart
And the saddest thing 'bout how it all came down
Is he's not here with me now
I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you
I wouldn't say I have regrets
'bout the time that we both spent
If the truth be known, I'm a little better too
So when he does the little things, when he treats you like a queen
In a crazy way I'm bearing the rood
Ooh, I feel like I did all the fixing in mud
But you moved into our house of love
I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you
I don't blame you, I'm not saying you stole him away from me
I just want you to know he's not the man he used to be, yeah
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you
I guess I've got him ready for you

The first thing that I heard you say
When you were standing there
Set in your way was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
Cause there was nothing there
That you could see
That could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I've set you free this time
I have never been so far out in front
That I could ever ask for what I want
And have it any time
Knowing this you found a thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that went before
And memories that always seems to
Tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you seem me to be
I've set you free this time
I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to win or a thing to lose
Because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
There was only something
You can look at lying in your hand
Now who's wondering what has changed
And why it can not be arranged
To have each thing work fine
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I'll set you free this time

Cowboys don't cry, and heroes don't die
Good always wins, again and again
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true
Oh, if life were like the movies, I'd never be blue
[CHORUS]
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world
I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would
Repeat
[REPEAT CHORUS]

I don't mind
If my heart don't beat and
The sun don't shine
They'll get theirs
You'll get yours and I'll get mine
It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me
Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget
I'm alright
Am I made of steel
Am I locked up tight
I'm human
But I'm wide awake and afraid to fight
It used to take nothing to amaze me
But now I'm older and
It doesn't even phase me
Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget
It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me
Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

(1)John Wesley Harding shot a man for snoring, killed him in the bed right where he lay,
Took a snort of whisky and went back to his sleepin, Rode out before they found him the next day,
(2)Now the brothers Frank and Jesse, No-one could be more fearsome,
They robbed the trains and rode in the outlaw gangs,
The civil war was over but still they fought for Dixie,
And legend has their last name to be James.
Chorus
Livin in the west must have been the best, Must have been the greatest time of all.
Me I lived in the east and I was bored to say the least
But I never saw those sons of guns in bar-rooms starting brawls
(3)Little William Bonney, Billy the Kid they called him, Had to use a six-gun to survive,
He bit the dust at twenty-one but he left a reputation, A notch for every year he was alive
Chorus
(4)Now the frontier days are over for William Frank and Jesse, And a thousand other bad guys of their day,
But they still live on in stories and I hope they live forever,And to sum it up here is all that I want to say (Chorus)

Old Red was one of the orneriest yet
I'd seen at the big rodeo
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode
Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed
From Idaho a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McClain
And Billy had never been thrown
The greatest desire filled young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
"I'll ride him or drop over dead"
Old Red was wicked down there in the chute
He was kickin' and stompin' about
Billy dropped into the saddle with ease
And said, "Turn him loose let us out"
Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Tryin' to get rid of the man of his back
But the man went wherever he'd go
Billy was rakin' old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doin' right well but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in
Old Red was bucking straight for the fence
Suddenly stopped in and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him
There was a hush in the crowd
For they knew this would be Billy's last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest
When they fell and under old Red Billy died
Old Red lay still no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In tryin' to throw Billy off of his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell
Out in the west is the place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode

Who makes me forget all the other girls I've met
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Who's sweeter to me that she really ought to be
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Little miss blue eyes looks so good
I'm gonna bring her to the neighborhood
I'm gonna make every girl in town
Jealous when she's around
I'm walking the line 'cause I'm glad that she's mine
I'm living in paradise
I know I can't go wrong by just stringing along
With sweet little miss blue eyes
Who's gonna start taking care of my heart
She makes me realize
It's love, she's for me, and I really want to be
With sweet little miss blue eyes

I know a magical place to get a taste of a little heaven on earth
It's just a watering hole but many a soul go there to quench their thirst
When my whistle's dry there's nowhere that I can think of I'd rather be
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
It has thirty cent draws and that's because they only cost Tony two-bits
See it's Tony's joint and he makes it a point to let every poor bum get lit
He's a drunk's patron saint and he won't hesitate to fix you some supper for free
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
Each morning at eight it opens it's gates for all my buddies and me
With our foots on the rail and our buckets of ale we tell stories no one believes
We spit and we cuss at the lives that left us then toast to our freedom with glee
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
I sit tight each night til they turn up the lights empty my last one and leave
Then squint my eyes at the dawn in the sky as people walk by on the street
God only knows where it is they go but there's only one place for me
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree

When rivers ran blue up on the mountain
And rivers ran green out on the plain
When the river ran red in Glenwood Canyon
It was only a matter of time
Then rivers ran gold up on the mountain
And rivers ran wild out on the plain
And the river ran free through Glenwood Canyon
And it was only a matter of time
And the miners came and they took the gold and the people staked a claim
And the builders came and they made a dam and the people came to play
And the 'dozers came and they built a road and the people found a way
Through Glenwood Canyon
Now rivers run grey up on the mountain
And rivers brown out on the plain
And the river runs red through Glenwood Canyon
But it's only a matter of time

HAPPY STREET
WRITER BEN PETERS
I was blue till I found you I didn't know where the road of life was leadin' me to
I'm on my own I walk alone it seems like Lonely Street would be my permanent home
But baby now I'm walkin' down Happy Street smilin' at everyone that I meet
Ain't it funny what fallin' in love can do oh honey
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street I never thought life could be so sweet
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street with you
Same old place same human race
But now it seems like the world's put on a happier face
Since you are mine each day I find
It's filled with sunshine and your love is makin' it shine
And baby now I'm walkin' down Happy Street smilin' at everyone that I meet
Ain't it funny what fallin' in love can do oh honey
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street I never thought life could be so sweet
But anyplace is Happy Street with you

Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken much too long
Gonna chase me a rainbow through a heaven of blue
Cause I'm all through crying over you
There was a time my love was needed my life completed my dreams came true
Then came the time my life was haunted my love unwanted all for you
Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken much too long
There was a time

Between Gallup and Shiprock, he was born in a Hogan
And his spirit was as free as an eagle flies
Deep in the canyons out in Arizona
He broke his first pony before he turned five
He learned how to hide in the branches of the canyons
The young riders herded the wild horses by
Then quick as a bobcat he closed in the willows
And a new crop of Mustangs were waitin' inside
He's a Navajo wrangler, an Indian cowboy
Bridles and saddles just get in his way
There ain't another on the whole reservation
Like the Navajo wrangler from canyon de Chelly
He never breaks horses with his spurs or a saddle
Just uses a blanket and a firm gentle hand
He's known far and wide from Chinle to Red Rock
And there ain't a horse he can't ride on the Navajo land

(Dolly Parton)
You hurt me, you use me, you lie
You're heartless and hateful and cold
You don't care how you make me cry
You must have the last word
And be in control
What is it about you I love
You're selfish and stubborn and proud
You're arrogant, boastful and vain
You're careless and thoughtless and loud
A flirt and a tease
And you cause me such pain
What is it about you I love
What is it, what is it my love
There's something about you
That I seem to need
I have a hunger you know how to feed
And you satisfy me like nobody else
Those moments of heaven
Are worth all this hell
And I know you love me in your own crazy way
And I know you need me more than you can say
I may be a fool but I'll never give up
'Cause there's something about you I love
What is it, what is it my love
And there's something about me
That you seem to need
'Cause you have a hunger I know how to feed
And I satisfy you like nobody else
Those moments of heaven
Are worth all this hell
And I know in my heart that you want to be good
I understand that you're misunderstood
You're insecure and defensively tough
There's something about you my love
What is it, what is it my love
There's something about you
That I seem to need
What is it, what is it my love

I wonder whose having my perfect night,
Standing where I used to be,
Tasting your sweet kind of dynamite,
Oh how I wish it was me.
Some one is having their dream come true,
Living my fantasy,
Some one is falling in love with you,
Oh how I wish it was me.
Somebody else is sailing my ship through a star spangled sky,
Some body else is melting your ways as the hours go by,
Heaven knows I wish it was me.
Some one is looking into your eyes,
Seeing what I used to see,
lost in your spell as the evening dies,
Oh how I wish it was me.
As the hours go on by heaven knows I wish it was me.
I wonder whose having my perfect night,
Standing where I used to be,
Tasting your sweet kind of dynamite,
Oh how I wish it was me.
Oh how I wish it was me.

My father's name was Hannibal
My mother was Hanna Maria
Everything we owned got all burned up
In the great depression fire.
Strip mines and one crop farming
Drained the green earth dry
We lost it all, only love is left
And that's the one thing money can't buy.
[Chorus]
We're all Dust Bowl children
Singing a Dust Bowl song
And the crops won't grow
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing
Fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing
Fields are gone.
They said in California
There was work of every kind
Well the only job I got out there
Was waiting in a welfare line.
Once I had a dollar
Once I had a dream
But now all the work gets done
by a big ol' machine.
[Chorus]
We're all Dust Bowl children
Singing a Dust Bowl song
And the crops won't grow
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing
Fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing
Fields are gone.

I've lived a life full of sorrow
With no where to run or to hide
Happiness you'll see is borrowed
All I want is you by my side
[Chorus]
Gentle river take me away
to the time of happier days
All I need is love and company
Gentle river bring him back to me
You can spend all your time a'cryin'
Listen here I don't need your sympathy
Cause I've made my life to live it
All I need is you here with me...
[Chorus]

Me and Dixie, we'd waste away
Sleep through the night and all the next day
Sleep through the sun, rain and moon
Here, in this room
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Me and Dixie, we rolled and dreamed
Time held us alone in this world it seemed
Then morning broke and awoke you from me
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
So come back, Dixie, I'll rock you to sleep
Back to our dreams our twisted sheets
Cradle your fading stars in my arms
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child
Oh, rockabye, my Dixie child

She was born in the brief mountain springtime
Blue in the late mountain snow
And she grew in the sunlight of summer
But she knew when the aspen turned gold
That she had grown old
[Chorus]
Columbine, columbine
Blue in the Rockies
Well I missed you, while you were away?
Will I see you next summer, wild on the mountain?
Will you be there, when I pass your way?
She was there in the brief mountain springtime
Blue in the late mountain snow
And we lived in the sunlight of summer
But I knew when the aspen turned gold
That I had grown old
[Chorus]
Columbine, columbine
Blue in the Rockies
Will you miss me, when I've gone away?
Will I see you next summer, wild on the mountain?
Will you be there, when I pass your way?

Girl I can tell that you're thinking of leaving
But it'll hurt me so much you don't want me to know
You've done all you can to hide what you're feeling
Oh, but one part of you, it let's your feelings show
Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay
And your warm red lips say you won't go away
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie
So I say what's wrong and darlin' you just say it's nothin'
I can almost believe it hun when I hold you like this
But I know in my heart that there's no tomorrow
So just for tonight hun I'll pretend that there is
Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay
And your warm red lips say you won't go away
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie

Down in the valley while on my knees
I asked my Jesus carry please
He promised that He'd take care of me
If I would lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
I 'll be your father, I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister and your brother
He said if I be lifted up
I'll bring joy, joy, joy to your soul
When I am lonely, when I am sad
My Jesus comes and makes me glad
He is the dearest friend I've have had
I want to lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
I 'll be your father, I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister and your brother
He said if I be lifted up
I'll bring joy, joy, joy to your soul

I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same
I will miss a million things that make you dear
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep
You're happiness oh you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
And as you travel on your way just remember that each day
Someone thinks of you and hopes you're happy dear
(I ask for a silver star to shine brightly where you are
To guide your way through all eternity)
And when it's shining from above it will sparkle down with love
In all its glory for the world to see
Your kindly heart will help you find the happiness you have in mind
Your treasured chest will be the best cause it's filled with God's sunshine
I wonder why there are so few lovely people just like you
My but I will surely miss you when you go (when you go)

(She wakes me with a kiss every morning)
And she loves me to sleep every night
How lucky I am to have searched for
And found the beginning of the rest of my life
She wakes me with a kiss every morning
And she loves me to sleep every night
Her goal for each day is to find some new way
To please me and keep me satisfied
She wakes me with a kiss every morning
And she loves me to sleep every night
Her love is too strong to let me be wrong
Even when we both know I'm to blame
And when trouble and hard times are raining
Her love soaks up my share of the rain
She never complains and I've never seen distance
In her baby blue eyes

You left me, my darling to travel alone
My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you're not around
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
They know I've been faithful and true
So when they start asking why you're not around
How will I explain about you?
They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I loved you so true
But now that you've gone and I'm left all alone
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
I can't let them know that we're through
They wouldn't believe it could ever be true
How will I explain about you?
If ever you were lonely and wish to return
Remember I'm waiting for you
But if I must travel that pathway alone
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
How will I explain about you?

I'm in I'm out sure then I'm in doubt
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
I win I lose I'm happy then I'm blue
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
I tell myself I ought to leave you I almost make it through the door
I'd be a fool to try and leave you I'll just come back for me
Your hello goodbye make me laugh then cry
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
Oh and I tell myself I ought to leave you

It started out when Adam
First laid his eyes on Eve
Something passed between them
That came down through history
Carried by an angel
Whispered on the breeze
It waited till the time was right
Then it found you and me
It must be written on a block of stone
Buried by sand in an ancient land
Carved upon the side of the oldest tree
It must be more than just a dream come true
Yes I believe the good Lord always knew
I was meant to be with you
Standing here beside you
In my heart I know
This love that we were meant to share
Began so long ago
As sure as rain was made to fall
And mountains made to stand
I was born to be with you
There was nothing left to chance
It must be written on a block of stone
Buried by sand in an ancient land
Carved upon the side of the oldest tree
It must be more than just a dream come true
Cause I believe the good Lord always knew
I was meant to be with you
From the beginning to the end of time
I was to be yours, you were to be mine
It must be written on a block of stone
Buried by sand in an ancient land
Carved upon the side of the oldest tree
It must be more than just a dream come true
Cause I believe the good Lord always knew
I was meant to be with you

Twenty-one days out on the road,
The van broke down in a foot of snow.
Don't even know where the hell we are,
The batteries gone and the phone won't charge.
Wanted let you know, I'm doing my best to get back home.
I ain't had no sleep, ain't washed my clothes
But everybody says it's a damn good show.
The pay's enough and the crowds are good,
But sometimes I'd rather be chopping wood
Or rolling rocks up a hill,
But it's the only way I know to pay the bills.
And the songs I sing can't get through and my mind fills up with you
And I drift off in a dream, about you and me.
When I wake up to a wild ass crowd, the guitar amp is way too loud.
Well the drummer's been cheating on his wife
And the bass man is too drunk to drive
That's the way it goes
I'm just doing my best to get back home
And the songs I sing can't get through and my mind fills up with you
And I drift off in a dream, about you and me
Well the manager called, we've got five more shows,
Let me talk to the kids and then I got to go.
Your man's got to do what a man's got to do to bring that money on home to you.
I want to let you know, I'm just doing my best to get back home.
I'm just doing my best to get back home.
I'm just doing my best to get back home.

Here, here is where I was born
My father's son
In the heart of the country
Here I got my family tree
Deep down in me Still growing strong
But there, there are those city lights
Shining bright
Calling me
And there is where I got to go
Or I'll never know
Who I can be
Sometime between now and then
I'll find my way back home
But until you see me walking
Down that long and dusty road
I'll be somewhere between here and there
Here I've got a world I know
It may be slow
But it's true
And her I got my Ann-Marie
She needs me
And I need her too
But there, there are those city lights
Shining bright
Calling me
And though it's more that I can bear
I've got to go
Cause my dreams are there

This ain't no song about the good old days
'Cept for times and the easy ways
Or how I long for an old dirt road
Greener grass or a lighter load
I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in sixty-five
Yeah, I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
Rain would fall and the mud would rise
Through my toes in the summer time
August heat would dry that clay
Dust went flying like a dandelion
I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in sixty-five
Yeah, I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes
Stubbed my toes on rocks and stones
Slipped and fell in old potholes
Watched my mama shake that line
Dust them clothes off hanging in the hot sunshine
I was glad to see the blacktop
When they laid it down in sixty-five
Yeah, I was glad to see the blacktop
No more dust in my eyes

You find the thrill each time you let me down you know if you need me I'll be around
And when all your love affairs come to an end you know you can fool me again
Fool me again make my heart believe that your sweet sweet love belongs to me
Yes play the part and let my heart pretend come back and fool me again
The same old line that keeps me hanging on is all I think about when I'm alone
And though I know how our love affair will end come back and fool me again
Fool me again

They say you've gotta lose a couple fights to win
It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting
They say that this is where the fun begins
I guess it's time that I was quitting
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
They said "I hope that you will never change"
I went and cut my hair
They say "Don't take your business to the big time"
I bought us tickets there, oh
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
What did you expect
And what did you forget
That to live you let go of me with each step
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
To aggression
Are you to assess what I've been? What I am? Or become?
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
It can be to
Attack those around 'cause you're
True to color, a town, a time, or a place?
It's not you, it's not mine
And besides it is gone
And you never will find it again
But I don't want to fight
I just ask let me be
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
So go home
Think it through
A jet plane and a big idea
I jump over the sea
What if's hot on my trail
But they can't catch me, no
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?

You've been sanctified (terrorized)
And I've been tried
Guilty by association
You've been canonized
And I've been fried
Guilty by association
All the little loonies
With a salient obsession
Come out from the boonies
With their sharpies and their guns
Loaded with questions

By my song, you will know the heart that's in me
By my song, you'll know that I am here
Just words and notes together, but
Long after I'm gone
You will know I loved you
By my song
By my song, you will always be remembered
Yes, you'll live on, just as you are right now
Your eves won't lose their sparkle,
To the ages they'll belong
The world will know I loved you
By my song
In these simple rhymes of mine
You will stay till the end of time
And in this tune where love abounds
Someday you'll come back around
By my song, long as love is not forgotten
On and on, we'll sail beyond the years
Just words and notes together
To the ages they'll belong
The world will know I love you
By my song
You will know I loved you
By my song

I've just been to heaven with someone so true I dreamed about mama last night
She read me her Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
Mama used to never go to sleep at night until all of us were in bed
On party nights till we come home she often sat up and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when children were away
We only knew that she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we were all gonna come home alright
Why sometimes we'd stayed away till one or two or three
And I used to think that mama could hear the turning of the key
For we'd step aside and she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand just why
But up until the last one had returned mama always kept a light
She couldn't go to sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
I think mama just had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
She seemed to fear that the world might harm the ones that she loved the best
One time she told me when you're grown to women and to men
I'll sleep the whole night through I bet I'll be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
Then always when we got back home we'd find her waiting there
And then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know that we were all alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years then mama went to sleep
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep I dreamed about mama last night

His eyes are greener than the meadows
His hair is greyer than a ghost
His lungs are blacker than the shadows
That dance in circles down below
You see them every Monday morning
Electric halos light their way
Five days of widows mourning
But Friday rolls the stone away
[Chorus]
Kentucky mine, doing time
Never see the light of day
Kentucky mine, stand in line
Just to dig your own grave
From coal dust they make a living
To coal dust they will return
The earth is good but unforgiving
And someone's got to keep the fire burnin'
Daddy says, "Listen to me,
Do not follow where my footsteps lead"
[Chorus]
And everything he said was true
But what's a Kentucky boy like me to do?
[Chorus]

My car broke down on our first date;
We missed the movie an' we never ate;
It was freezin' cold an' the heater broke.
I apologized, you kissed me goodnight,
An said: "It couldn't have been any better."
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.
If you like that ring you saw in the window,
In the jewelery store down town.
If you like tuxedos an' white satin dresses,
Maybe you better sit down.
If you like driftin' off to soft pillow talk,
An wakin' up together,
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.
If you like livin' on a rural route,
Fixin' up an' old farmhouse.
Hugs with your coffee and your good mornin's with a kiss
If you like startin' a fire on a cold winter's night,
An' makin' dreams come true together:
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.
If you like that movie we saw last September:
The one you cried half way through.
If you liked that scene where he got down on one knee,
Girl, have I got somethin' for you.
If you like love like wine that grows sweeter with time,
An' keeps gettin' better an' better,
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.

They're not teardrops just sincere drops they're I love you drops and I love you
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight
I love you drops I miss you drops hurry home drops you've been gone so long drops
They're not teardrops just sincere drops they're I love you drops and I love you
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek
I love you drops I miss you drops
(Hurry home) I love you

I've had good luck, and bad luck
And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you
I've been turned on, and turned down
When the bars close at two
But I always get lucky with you
I keep two strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you
I keep two strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you
I always get lucky with you

You've made up your mind
We don't want the same thing
And that we won't change things
Wishing there were ways
And there's no use staying together
Nothing lasts forever
That's what you say
And that makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us
I still believe we've got something worth saving
I keep hoping and praying for another chance
You've held my heart and your gonna break it
Cause you want to make it
A part of your past
And that makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us

Whenever she walks flowers grow in her footsteps
Whenever she talks all the birds hush their singing
The heart of a saint and the face of an angel
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
And when this cruel world's been gettin' me down
She'll take my frown and she'll turn it back around
Like a clown, she'll crack a joke
Acting crazy as a fool
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
(Chorus)
It'd be a big old fat lie, if I said I
Wasn't turned on just by her looks alone
She's so much more, so much more than meets the eye
She's an angel on loan from up above

All it will take is just one moment and
You can say goodbye to how we had it planned
Fear like a habit run like a rabbit out and away
Through the screen door to the unknown
And I want to love you and more
I want to find you and more
Where do you reside, when you hide?
How can I find ya?
'Cause I want to send you and more
I want to tempt you and more
Can you tell that I
Am alive let me prove it.
You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, we're the same
Live like a pharaoh
Sing like a sparrow anyway
Even if there is no land or love in sight
We bloom like roses, lead like Moses, out and away
Through the bitter crowd to the daylight
And I want to love you and more
I want to find you and more
Can you tell that I
Am alive let me prove it to ya.
You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You rejoice, I complain
But you and, I we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You and I, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, we're the same
I want to love you and more
I want to find you and more
Where do you reside
When you hide how can I find ya
'Cause I wanna save you and more
I wanna tempt you and more
Can you tell that I am alive, let me prove it
You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You and I, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I
You and I

Pearl, Pearl, Pearl by Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs
CHORUS
C	G
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl, come let us see our girl
G
Are you still our valentine? Do you still look so divine?
G	C
Come and let us see our darlin' Pearl
C	G
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl, don't give your love to Earl
G
I have got a horse and mule, Forty acres near a school
G	C
We'll be happy as two bugs
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl, come be my loving girl
Don't you marry Lester Flatt, He slicks his hair with possum fat
Change your name to Mrs. Earl Scruggs
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl, you'll get no love from Earl
This here man is such a sap, He won't hold you on his lap
Unless you are an old 5-string banjo
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl, he's nutty as a squirrel
If you'll be Mrs. Scruggs, We'll live on kisses and hugs
Like Juliet and Romeo.

There's lots of pretty cowgirls but this you may not know
There's a very special kind at every rodeo
Her husband is a cowboy she's his greatest fan
She's the wife behind the cowboy and the cowboys a lucky man
She's hauled water from the crick and got dust all over her clothes
She's been so hot she's thought she'd die and so cold she nearly froze
She's cooked over an open fire slept under the stars above
And you know she'd do it all again just to be with the man she loves
She rides the circuit with her man they go from town to town
She builds up his confidence when the horses buck him down
And she's driven weary miles across an endless land
She's the wife behind the cowboy and the cowboys a lucky man
When he climbs down in the chute and about to start his ride
She cheers more than anyone with a special kind of pride
And when she hears that whistle blow and she sees her cowboy smile
She's glad because he's happy and that makes it all worthwhile

Well my dad he used to tell me, any man can be a king
It ain't that complicated, well it's a very simple thing.
You don't need no castle or thrown for sittin' in
All you need is one good friend.
If ya find yourself somebody, who would meet you at a stump
On a rainy Sunday morning, before the sun is even up
Who will stand right there beside you
Fight any fight you're in, then you've got one good friend
There ain't nothing wrong with all those rowdy boys I run with
The ones that I go drink with after work
Lately it's been hittin' me, when my heart's in trouble
You're the one that always shows up first.
You're a pleasure as a lover, you're a treasure as a wife
I don't have to wonder who I could count on in this life
You've already proved it to me time and time again
Baby you're one good friend
You're the one that sends me flying and gently reels me in
Baby you're one good friend.

Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone and make him mine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine, ooh

Under the open skies deep in the heart of Texas
The sun shines down on the cotton field
As the clouds roll by across the sky
Carry my love to the Rio Grande
Please send my echo floating down through the canyon
Maybe she will hear my call
I'll be there soon I'll bring the moon
On a string of stars just for you
I miss the one I call my own why did I leave her alone
Two days more on this lonesome ride
Then she'll be riding by my side
Under the open sky deep in the heart of Texas
I can almost hear her calling me
I miss the one I call my own,why did I leave her alone?
Two days more on this lonely ride then she'll be riding by my side
Under the open sky,deep in the heart of Texas
The sun shines down on the cotton field
As the clouds roll on by across the sky
Carry my love to the Rio Grande

He came to town on an old freight train
He jumped off in the pouring rain
Everybody said he's insane
Just a low down no account hobo
He made his bed beneath the county bridge
The city folks said hey that's not his
They signed a petition they're gonna get rid
Of that low down no account white trash
What if Jesus comes back like that
On an old freight train in a hobo hat
Will we let him in or turn our back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that
She was born into drug abuse
She couldn't help what her mama used
It wasn't like she got to choose
Now she's layin' there all alone
Got a monkey on her back
Nurses say they never saw a smile like that
Doctor says she might stand a chance
If somebody takes her home
What if Jesus comes back like that
Two months early and hooked on crack
Will we let him in or turn our back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that
Nobody said life is fair
We've all got a cross to bear
When it gets a little hard to care
Just think about him hanging there
He came to town on a cold dark night
A single star was his only light
The baby born that silent night
A manger for his bed
What if Jesus comes back like that
Where will he find our hearts are at
Will he let us in or turn his back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Will he cry when he sees where our hearts are at
Will he let us in or turn his back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Hey what if Jesus comes back like that

You see people coming from all sides
With their broken hearts and hollow eyes
And you try to love but it's easier to hate
When the seed that was planted was watered too late
Ooh, oh, child
Ooh, oh, child
Your roots stretch down to grow up wild
Roots stretch down to grow up wild
It was late last night when the doorbell rang
My brother in some trouble
He stood shaking on the doorstep in the rain
With a freight train pounding in his veins
And I took him in and cleaned him up
Gave him some water and I put him to bed
Then I cried for the sadness of his life
And his lonely struggle with addiction
Friends say, oh, what a shame
Mum says no one but himself to blame
But I don't want to play that game
'Cause I know the truth is not so plain
Call it a hard life or a lack of love
Call it passed down from his father
Call it lack of faith in God above
There are no easy answers
He is just a child, he is just a child
Arms stretched out for love
Arms stretched out for love
Arms stretched out for love

You look just like somebody that I used to know
Some old flame I could not handle so long ago
Everything about you looks like heart over mind
You're just too much candy for a dime
You're just too much candy for a dime, ain't no way
I can look into those eyes of yours and walk away
You think I would know better but I fall every time
You're just too much candy for a dime
So dance with me and tell me how you think it could be
I can't read your mind so tell me what you want out of me
You're too good to be true, but then I know one more time
You're just too much candy for a dime
You're just too much candy for a dime, ain't no way
I can look into those eyes of yours and just walk away
You think I would know better but I fall every time
You're just too much candy for a dime
You're just too much candy for a dime

Is yours is mine
Inside misunderstanding lines you have gone
Maybe there's time for something more than what we've done
Wishing not to hold you down with iron binds
Is this day and this time
Is yours is mine
I walked along the walls and there I saw your name
I choose to spend my feelings chance, play the game
The stormy weather passed and left me here to find
That the rain and the shine
Is yours is mine
Is yours is mine

The river flows, it flows to the sea
Wherever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
All he wanted was to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
Flow river flow, past the shady trees
Go river go, go to the sea
Flow to the sea
The river flows, it flows to the sea
Wherever it goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town

This ol' smoke filled bar is somethin' I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be livin'
Well, it's not much but I feel welcome here inside
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here, the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
Thanks to you, I'm always here till closing time
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time

When you go to church on Sunday and leave your Saviour out
You feel like you're alone when you all begin to shout
When you get that old time religion you want the world to know
(But you won't have ask nobody) you can feel it in your soul
You can feel it in your soul that you want the world to know
(But you won't have ask nobody) you can feel it in your soul
[ dobro ]
Some people ask the neighbors about the ways of sin
And what they have to do for Christ to live within
But let me tell you brother one thing you should know
(And you won't have ask nobody) you can feel it in your soul
You can feel it in your soul...
[ ac.guitar ]
If you haven't got time religion and don't know what to do
You better take up the Bible and lead the pages through
It tell you any word of things you want to know
(And you won't have ask your neighbors) you can feel it in your soul
You can feel it in your soul...

Since I have known you there's a shadow hanging over you
Keeping you from scene that you might need me
It's too bad that you're not glad for I could take you to the place where love is
Someone you loved another time is standing in the way of mine
Wishes that I have to try and mend to pieces
But I know that it's too late I'll never take you to the place where love is
Where love is you will never know you are the kind to love one time and not let go
You don't know how much I wish that you would give just one kiss
And open up your heart to me so I could enter
But if I could only get you there you might find you'd like to share where love is

Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now
Verse I:
And the eyes that used to burn for me
Now they no longer look my way
And the love that used to be
Why, it just got lost in yesterday
And if she seems cold to the touch
Well there used to burn a flame
I gave too little, took too much
'Til I erased the painter's name
Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now
Chorus instrumental

(Billy Dean)
I came home from college to see my old man
He was sittin' on the porch swing, with a book in his hand
He stared at my earring, and at my tattoo
He smiled and shook his head and said
It's good to see you
He chose his words carefully cause it was hard for me to come
And he knew I had ta temper and where I got it from
I waited for the sermon, the one I knew so well
But this time he wasn't preachin'
About heaven or hell
He said a real man knows the value of a woman
A real man has got nothin to prove
He's strenthened by love
And the Lord up above
So do the best that you can
To be a real man
Could it be that I saw just a glimpse of his soul
Or maybe losin' Mama had just taken it's toll
He gave me his Bible, stained with tears he had cried
And I opened up the cover
Where he wrote inside
And it said
A real man has got nothin to prove
He's strenthened by love
And the Lord up above
So do the best that you can
To be a real man
Do the best that you can
To be a real man

This ain't comin' from no prophet,
Just an ordinary man.
When I close my eyes,
I see the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand.
When the last child cries for a crust of bread,
When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.
Stand straight, walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.
When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out,
'Cause we shall be free.
And when money talks for the very last time,
And nobody walks a step behind;
When there's only one race,
And that's mankind, then we shall be free.
We shall be free ,we shall be free
Stand straight, (walk proud,)
Have a little faith, (hold out;)
We shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free,
(Stand straight,) stand straight,
(Have a little faith,) walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.

My buddy Blake was all-state with dreams of the NFL
Jenny McClain had big brains
She got a scholarship to Yale
And there was Hershel who did two commercials
And he was going to be a movie star
But all I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
Part time job making chicken kabobs at the food court at the mall
I hauled my uncle's trash
I cut my neighbor's grass
And I raked the leaves in the fall
My parents they were stunned how this former lazy bum was suddenly working so hard
But all I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
Yeah when I was sixteen all of my dreams revolved around one thing
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
When I finally got that big hunk of steel
Those four wheels underneath
I went everywhere in it
Broke the speed limit
And I even broke in the backseat
Now when I look outside sitting in the drive
It blows my mind to see an SUV and a sedan
And two kids playing and I can't believe they all belong to me
When I caught my mama's eye in that thing I used to drive
I never dreamed it would take me this far
All I wanted was a car
Sixteen all of my dreams revolved around one thing
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car

[Chorus]
I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now they're in bright glory
And are sleeping on the saviors breast
They set a good example for me
And they taught me how to pray
Now I truly converted
And walkin' on the narrow way
I know that if I can not meet them on high
Then how lonely I will be
For what good is my journey
If I miss out on eternity
[chorus]

Dont put a bridle on a bull
Hell never do what you want him to
Dont put a bridle on a bull
Hell just take you for a fool
And if you take him by his horns
That bull will run right over you
That ol mule dont wanna plow
Talk to him with a two-by-four
And if he still dont wanna plow
Talk to him just a little bit more
And if he just dont wanna listen
Haul him off to the dog food store
Dont put a bridle on a bull
Hell never do what you want him to
Put a bridle on a bull
Aint no tellin what the bull will do
And if you take him by his horns
Hes gonna try to run you through
Got a high toned woman
Keep your one eye on the door
Got a high toned woman
Make you wonder what your suitcase is for
She gonna worry about where you goin
Then she dont need the house no more
Put a bridle on a bull
Hell never do what you want him to
Dont put a bridle on a bull
Hell just take you for a fool
Put a ring in his nose
That bullll follow you
Put a ring in his nose
And that big bad bull will follow you

There's a picture that I carry,
One we made some time ago
If they ask who's in the picture with me,
I say just a girl, I used to know
Just a girl, I used to go around with
Just a friend, from long ago,
I don't tell them how lost I am without her
I say she's just a girl, I used to know.
I say, she's just another girl now
Just a flame, that's lost it's glow
And I say, her name has slipped my mind now,
And she's just a girl, I used to know
Just a girl, I used to spend some time with
Just a friend, from long ago,
I don't talk about the nights I cry without her
I say she's just a girl I used to know

Excuse me uh, but do you actually have yes in your vocabulary,
I guess it started when I was a kid,
If you said I couldn't do it I did,
Always had a stubborn streak,
Put a wall in front of me,
And I'll find a way to get around it,
There was a friend who said I'd never make the team,
A lot of small town talk said I'd never leave,
Ah and you know who you are,
You all played a part,
In pushin' me on to my dream,
I want to thank everone who ever told me no,
Pack it up and get back home,
It kept me going knowin' I would prove them wrong,
Yea I knew it all along,
Without 'm I might have given up a long time ago, and so,
I want to thank everyone who ever told me no,
Played my music for a man behind a desk,
He said sorry what you've got I just don't get,
Ah but here I am today,
Standin' on this stage,
And I wonder even now if he gets it yet
I want to thank everyone who ever told me no,
Pack it up and get back home,
It kept me going knowin' I would prove them wrong,
Yeah I knew it all along,
Without 'm I might have given up a long time ago, and so,
I want to thank everyone who ever told me no,
The ones who said I'd never make it,
Those who doubted I could take it,
I'll owe ya one,
I want to thank everyone who ever told me no,
Pack it up and get back home,
It kept me going knowin' I would prove them wrong,
Yeah I knew it all along,
Without 'm I might have given up a long time ago, and so,
I want to thank everyone who ever told me no,
Yea I want to thank everyone who ever told me no,

We were made for each other I'm for you (you're for me)
There will never be another I'll be yours eternaly
For as long as the world turns and the leaves of autumn fall
Long as there's a star in heaven I'll be waitin' for your call
We were made for each other
(For as long as the wind blows long as summer follows spring
Long as winter brings the snowflakes I will love you constantly)
We were made for each other
No there will never be another I'll be yours eternaly

I rolled off the Frisco mint in 1909
The last one they ever made, you should've seen me shine
When I landed on the counter they gave me to a kid
Making change for a jaw breaker was the first thing that I did
I got traded for a pocket knife, two marbles and some string
Wound up on a railroad track waiting for a train
Snatched up by a hobo and turned right into wine
Pitched up against the wall at least a thousand times
Round and round a penny goes
Round and back again
Listen and I'll tell you
The places that I've been
I was stolen from a banker by Pretty Boy Floyd and then
He gave me to a farmer who was trying to save his land
I was good luck to a soldier back in world war two
He lost me in a poker game the day the war was through
I got stuck behind the back seat of a '51 Chevrolet
Spare change in the sixties, getting worthless every day
Not it's piggy banks and gum machines and occasional wishing wells
Or laying on a bar room floor
As far and wide
So both of us can dare
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have to share
A chance to sail among the stars
That few will ever see
To feel the deepest missing you
That most think cannot be
A heart that beats for only one
And loves you fast and true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
These things I have to give to you
Their value isn't much
Just things that you can barely see
And rarely ever touch
A hand to hold when we're alone
And no one seems to care
A gentle touch to reassure
And tell you I'm still there
To try my best to reminisce
Our dreams that all come true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
My promise I will love and bide
This I give to you

[ Both ]
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again
[ Merle ]
Our love grew cold a long time ago we both know love is gone
Yet we stay together we just keep hanging on
[ Bonnie ]
But it's wrong to live together when our love has reached an end
[ Both ]
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again
I wanna be kissed like I used to be thrilled like I used to be
Loved like I used to be I wanta live again
[ Bonnie ]
Each time we kiss we search for love that used to fill our hearts
But it's all wrong the thrill is gone we're just too far apart
[ Merle ]
We live a life of loneliness each day that we pretend
[ Both ]
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again
I wanna be kissed like I used to be...

She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
No matter where I go, no matter who I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Though she said goodbye and set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me, she was true, true, true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me, she was true, true, true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Oh, the sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me

Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Oh no, here ya coming down the road
With your cotton dress a swishing
You're getting some attention
From all the boys in Thibodaux

Smiling and a winking
I know what they're thinking
But I'm the only one who loves you so
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Oh no, the hottest little dish I know
I know that you can tell it
You're making me so jealous
From my head down to my toes
Oh me, you could make a red neck green
The way that you're a looking
You got me a cooking
And I ain't talking bout Etoufee'
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream

To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain

Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Ponchartrain

Roll on muddy river, roll to the sea
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
It's about a love that's got me blue
A love forsaken for somebody new
He roles through town just like you do
He's just like the river that's only passing through
So roll on muddy river, roll to the sea
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
I've grown so tired of all those lies
I'm on my way now to find some bluer skies
Gonna find me a ticket far from this town
Far from the river that only brings me down
I've got a broken heart, it's about to mend
Like it always has, time and time again
Gonna send these troubles on down the line
I'm gonna let them spill and flow away like wine
Roll on muddy river, roll to the sea
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground

Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your big sister?s dress
I could hear my own heart beating, when you laid your head on my chest.
No telling how long it was since the last song
With the band gone and the lights all faded.
All alone on that gym floor, dancing with no music playing.
Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your mama?s white dress
Rice in your hair, your shoes in one hand, and one hand caressing my neck.
The light from the moon filled that old hotel room
As my hands closed around your waist.
And we were holding each other, dancing with no music playing
Ohhhh, there's nothing to say
Youuu take me away
Dancing with no music playing
Oh, dancing with no music playing
Me in my old faded Levi?s, you in your blue cotton dress
Time it don't have no effect on the way that you still steal my breath.
As we spin once more across the cold kitchen floor,
Your warm cheek touches my face,
And I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing
Oh, I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing

The reason why I can't say
Gotta let you go babe and right away
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Baby for a long time you had me believe
You said your love was all mine and that's the way it would be
I didn't know that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
I got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your game anymore
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone*

Lay down your head
On cotton and feathers, so soft
Let go of feelin' alone
Have something that baby you're not
And right now you don't call me friend,
But I'm still here, where I've always been
And even though you don't know it right now,
I'll outlast the shadows of doubt
Yeah, I'm stronger then shadows of doubt
And when you find love again
Yes, baby, I hope that you do
Maybe we won't be in vain
and you'll let me be somethin' to you
And right now you don't call me friend,
But I'm still here where I've always been
And even though you don't know it right now,
I'll outlast the shadows of doubt
Yeah, I'm stronger then shadows of doubt

On an icy road one night a young man loses his life
They marked the shoulder with a cross
And his family gathers round on a piece of hallowed ground
Their hearts are heavy with their loss
As the tears fall from their eyes
There's one who'll always sympathize
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
And all the angels up in heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than oh, they've ever known
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home
It still makes me sad when I think of my grand dad
I miss him each and every day
But I know the time will come when my own gradnson
Wonders why I went away
Maybe we're not meant to understand
Till we meet up in the Promised Land
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
And all the angels up in heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than oh, they've ever known
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home
Yeah, we're so far from home

Strange things are happening everyday
I hear the music up above my head
Though the side of my heart has left me again
I hear music up above
Secrets are written in the sky
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found
Though the sound of hope has left me again
I hear music up above
Standing in my broken heart all night long
Darkness held me like a friend when love was lost
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross
The finders love
I know I loved you too much
Ill go alone to get through
I hear Rosetta singing in the night
Echo's of lighting shine like stars after there gone
And tonight shes my guide as a girl on the moon
With the music up above

I'm just out of the light,
I hadn't caught her eye,
But I think I might be lovin' her.
I just stepped outta the door,
Gotta be a fool to wanna go one more,
For the way were were.
For the good times, how many times?
I'm losin' track.
Everybody goes, everybody knows,
that you don't look back.
There's no love in the space I've gained,
I could burn my bridges through a pourin' rain.
No matter how far or hard I ride,
I can't outrun what I feel inside.
Tell me, who do you see?
See me running 'round, and you think I'm free,
From the way we hurt.
I don't mean bodily harm.
When it comes to the heart, it's a three alarm,
You gotta be alert.
For the good times, how many lines?
I'm losin' slack.
It's the way it goes, everybody knows,
and you don't look back.
There's no love in the space I've gained,
I could burn my bridges through a pourin' rain.
No matter how far or hard I ride,
I can't outrun what I feel inside.
I never mind what I think I know,
I'm getting no-where everywhere I go.
There's no love in the space I've gained,
I could burn my bridges through a pourin' rain.
No matter how far or hard I ride,
I can't outrun what I feel inside.

Jody like a melody
play inside my head
till the thought of you is more than I can stand
just to think of having you is music to my soul
you make me feel
as though the world is in my hands
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
I can't believe the sun will rise
without me looking in your eyes
and knowing that your love has made me strong
why you left I'll never know
the fire you built will always glow
I only know I woke to find you gone
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
jody, I can't keep my thoughts
about me in the daytime
when your memory is enough to make me blind
and late at night I lie awake
and wait for you to come and when you don't
you know I almost lose my mind
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
jody like a melody...

Johnny Walker sat
At a table in a bar
Minding his own affairs
Drinking his namesake
Over the rocks
He was drunk
Too drunk to care
When a girl in the bar
Walked up beside him
And this is what she said
She said, a woman came by
With a letter for you
And this is what the letter said
[Chorus]
Dear, John, please, Johnny
Please come home
I need your love and
The kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't
Hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read
Then John
He got up from the table
Slowly, he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife
And little children at home
And how his drinking
Had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off
Into that street light
And a vision filled his
Poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him lying drunk
There in that gutter
Clutching in his hand
The letter that Johnny Walker read
And this is what it said
[Chorus: x2]

I've spent my life looking for you
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
but I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile
[Chorus]
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away
Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for awhile

Because the light always finds the darkest corner
And the raindrop always will rise to the clouds on high
And the red leaf falls back down to the garden
And the birds in the field know when to circle and fly
The cold it comes down from the mountain
And the river moves on to the ocean blue
Because all these things are true
I'll always be turning to you
Always
The touch of your skin on mine in the morning
And the rhythm of your breath in the moment of grace
It's like cotton, like linen, like velvet, like water, like stars in the
Sky, they'll always be falling
Like a breeze through the door, we lie on the floor, and I look in your face
In your eyes I see my reflection
And there's nothing more I can say or do
I cannot deny it's true
I'll always be turning to you
Always
Everything crumbles and nothing is real
But there's one drop of water in this raging river
Always turning to you
Turning to you
So I look for you in the fiery sunset
I look for you in the new sunrise
I listen for your name in the silence
I meet you behind closed eyes
In everything I do
I'll always be turning to you
Always returning
Always turning to you
Always and always and turning to you
I will always be turning to you

Been around enough to know
When a man is lying its bound to show
Its written on his face
The letters in the capital case
Guilty of these crimes he cause
Treat cheaters like they fired the law
But he proclaims undying love
I wonder who hes speaking of
Cause all he ever seems to do is break my little heart in two
Its killing me to find a man out there,
You'd think I'd find me one who cared
Show me some security and endues some sweet serenity
I cant keep up with who's is what
Boy this affair ain't fair enough
Men like him they love the chase
Girls give him time he'll throw the race
All he ever seems to do is break my little heart in two
I cant pretend I understand what makes a woman want a man
But all he ever seems to do is break her little heart in two
Run out the door jump in the car
But I never seem to get real far
Around the corner hit the gas
Drive fast enough and ill burn the past
Play the radio real loud,
Days like this make mommas proud
Feeling free feels good to me
And I'm right back where I used to be
All he's ever going to do oh I know its sad but true
All he's ever going to do is break her little heart in two
Break her little heart in two

It's Christmas time the chapel bells are ringing
The valley and the hills are filled with song
A time for peace while all the world is singing
How I wish it could be Christmas all year long
It's Christmas time when strangers smile at strangers
A time of hope a time to right from wrong
It's time to thank the baby in the manger
How I wish it could be Christmas all year long
Peace on earth good will to men seems a simply thing
But when Christmas ends it passes like a dream
It's Christmas time we put away our sorrow
A time for joy for happiness and song
We give thanks today but who thinks of tomorrow
How I wish it could be Christmas all year long

It was just another story written on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home
Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun?
Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol?
Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son?
Did no one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
It was just another story printed on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score...

The pale moon was rising above the green mountain,
The sun was declining beneath the blue sea,
When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain,
That stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee.
She was lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!
The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading,
And Mary, all smiling, was listening to me,
The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding,
When I won the heart of the Rose of Tralee.
Though lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!

Caleb Meyer, he lived alone
In them hollarin' pines
He made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time
Late one evening in back of my house,
Caleb came around
He called my name 'til I came out
With no one else around
[Chorus]
Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains.
But when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name
Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your husband gone?
Did he go down off the mountain side
And leave you all alone?
Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
To do some business there.
Then Caleb threw that bottle down
And grabbed me by my hair.
[Chorus]
He threw me on the needle bed,
And on my dress he lay
He held my hands above my head
And I commenced to pray.
I cried My God, I am your child
Send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips,
The bottle neck I found
I pulled that glass across his neck
As fine as any blade,
And I felt his blood run fast and hot
Around me where I laid.
[Chorus: x2]

Hey baby, let's jump in yo' truck
We'll ride and watch for lightnin' bugs
We'll ride with the windows let down
There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now
'Cause there ain't nothin' like the sound
Of a cooler slushin' on the bed 'a yo' truck
And ain't nothin' like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill singin' at night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, (and) don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good
We'll stop on a ol' dirt road bridge
Do you remember when we painted our names on it
And we'll listen to the creek as it runs
And we'll count the stars
Every single one
'Cause there ain't nothin' like the sound
Of a cooler slushin' on the bed 'a yo' truck
And ain't nothin' like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill singin' at night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, (and) don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good

You can cry, cry, cry like the rain
Ocean full of tears won't drown the pain
Take all your whiskey, pour it down the drain
Ain't nothin' gonna make you feel better
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker [Repeat: x2]
You can beg, beg, beg like a dog
Chase her 'round the world, but she'll still be gone
She did you right once, but left you all wrong
Now you're chewin' on a Dear John letter
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heartwrecker
Sing, sing, sing a sad song
Honky tonk jukebox playin' along
Until your last buddy and your money's gone
But still you can't not remember
So you pray, pray, pray like a saint
Promise your maker all kinds of things
He don't answer, but you know He'd say
Son you better just forget her
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heartwrecker
She was a sweet, sweet, sweeter than wine
Never knew nothin' could be so fine
So you took it all out and laid it on the line
Best you ever had only better
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker [Repeat: x3]

He's Cadillac Jack Favor and the name rings true
If he's got a ride any stranger would too
The one bad habit that his Ponder would say
Is sure gonna put him through the trials one day
And that's just what happened he took pity on two men
Heading down to Louisiana, he stopped and let them in
And the thanks he did for helping them
Would make him wish he was busting broncs again
He dropped them off in Bossieer City where they met up with a man
That vagabond commitee barely even had a plan
It was just a simple robbery turned double homicide
They got away with murder it'd be someone else's hide
Almost two years come and gone they never solved that crime
'Til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time
When that jailbird started singing they all knew the words were wrong
But the sheriff and the DA and the judge all sang along
They pinned it on Jack Favor, gave him life without parole
Gave Jack's freedom to the jailbird, payment on the lies he told
Just so happens that election year everybody payed out at the polls
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo, there'll be no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo, there's still no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name
Yeah, it's the world's most crooked picture and when it comes to being framed
Cadillac Jack Favor should be in the hall of fame

The house my family lives in just down the block
Many times I passed there but I never stopped
I go on all alone a wishin'
I could be in that house down the block
With my family
When we meet upon the street
I just bow my head
They don't know how often
I wish that I was dead
To our name I brought the shame
But still I long to be
In that house down the block with my family
When Gabriel blows his trumpet
And time will be no more
Then memories fade my daddy's faith
I'll walk up to the door
The tears that fall won't start at all
And God will let me be
In that house down the block with my family

I think I know now whats makin me sad
It's yearning for my own backyard
I realized baby I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my foolish country pride
Callin home
Runnin home back to gasoline alley
Where I started from
Callin home
Runnin home back to gasoline alley
Where I was born
Where the weathers better and the rails don't freeze
And the wind don't whistle around your knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch an early train
I'll be home before the milks upon your door
Goin home
Runnin home back to gasoline alley
Where I started from
Callin home
Runnin home back to gasoline alley
Where I was from
Goin home
Runnin home back to gasoline alley
Where I started from
Goin home
Runnin home back to gasoline alley
Where I was born
If anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions are good
I'd be singing in the alley if I could
And if I'm called away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'll be askin of you
Don't bury me here its to cold
Take me back
Carry me back down to gasoline alley
Where I started from
Take me home
Carry me home back to gasoline alley
Where I was born
Take me back
Carry me back down to gasoline alley
Where I started from
Take me home
Carry me home back to gasoline alley
Where I was born
Take me back
Carry me home yeah
Take me back
Don't bury me here its to cold
Carry me home
Take me back its to cold

Oh Lord please forgive me for what I'm about to do
I'm running on empty and my options are few
You know that I did the best that I can
But i've done hit rock bottom, my time is at hand
Because I lost my job
My bills are getting bigger
Cryin' baby bout to lose my mind
Hundred dollar habit, I ain't got a penny
My woman ran off with a friend of mine
I can't keep a job, cause I'm too fucked up
DHS bout to take my kids
Tryin' to get well, keep getting sicker
Sittin' in the parking lot, my finger on the trigger
You know I never meant to hurt anyone
And I'll face the consequences for everything I've done
And Lord sometimes I wonder if your even there
'Cause my burden is back-breaking and it's all that I can bear
Because I lost my job
My bills are getting bigger
Cryin' baby bout to lose my mind
Hundred dollar habit, I ain't got a penny
My woman ran off with a friend of mine
I can't keep a job, cause I'm too fucked up
DHS bout to take my kids
Tryin' to get well, keep getting sicker
Sittin' in the parking lot, my finger on the trigger

(Dolly Parton)
She was born in a place called Blue Valley
At the foot of the Tennessee hills
With the blue birds and blue bells
And blue mountain water
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill
But there was no peace in the valley
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man
Used and abused her mind and her body
So her mama said run while you can
So at fifteen she took to the highway
Belongings and guitar in hand
And she buried herself in her music
The one thing she did understand
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around
She hopes someday she will make it
And everyone says that she will
When she comes to town, crowds flock around
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills
She writes her letter back home to her mama
In care of the preacher in town
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church
And so her daddy cannot track her down
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby
Whenever she turns off the lights
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry
Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac
A band dressed in blue by her side
Instruments tied to the top and the back
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries
Expressing the feelings she holds inside
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet

My name is Dodge but then you know that
It's written on the chart there at the foot end of the of the bed
They think I'm blind that I can't read it
I've read it every word and every word it says is death
So confession Is that the reason that you came

Get it off my chest before I check out of the game
Since you mention it well there's thirteen things I'll name
Thirteen crosses high above the cold Missouri waters
August 49 North Montana
The hottest day on record the forest tinder dry
Lightning strikes in the mountains
I was crew chief at the jump base
I prepared the boys to fly
Pick the drop zone C47 comes in low
Feel the tap upon your leg that tells you go
See the circle of the fire down below
Fifteen of us dropped above the cold Missouri waters
Gauged the fire I'd seen bigger
So I ordered them to side hill we'd fight it from below
We'd have our backs to the river
We'd have it licked by morning even if we took it slow
But the fire crowned jumped the valley just ahead
There was no way down headed for the ridge instead
Too big to fight it we'd have to fight that slope instead
Flames one step behind above the cold Missouri waters
Sky had turned red smoke was boiling
Two hundred yards to saftey
Death was fifty yards behind
I don't know why I just thought it
I struck a match to waist high grass running out of time
Tried to tell them step into this fire I've set
We can't make it this is the only chance you'll get
But they cursed me
Ran for the rocks above instead
I lay face down and prayed above the cold Missouri waters
Then when I rose like the phoenix
In that world reduced to ashes
There was none but two survived
I stayed that night and one day after
Carried bodies to the river
Wondering how I stayed alive
Thirteen stations of the cross to mark their fall
I've had my say I'll confess to nothing more
I'll join them now those that they left me long before
Thirteen crosses high above the cold Missouri waters

Well you're the first car in an hour or so
I'm glad you stopped in it's sure been slow around here today
Just like everyday
Well I couldn't help but notice your California plates
And I thought I recognized that name on your credit card
You're a movie star
Well I can't wait to get back home and tell all my buddies
That I met one of the most famous people in the country
[Chorus]
Well I only go to movies when I'm down in Bowling Green
The cable don't come out this far so I never watch TV
I know you played in somethin' but I'm gonna need some help
Wait weren't you in Cannonball Run, no oh well
Allow me to introduce myself
My name ain't John this is somebody else's greasy shirt my name's Kurt
This is the town that I grew up in
Never seen L.A. the closest I've been to Hollywood is Dollywood
But when you get back to Beverly Hills you can tell all your buddies
That you met one of the most famous people in the country
[Chorus]
Cause I caught the record small mouth out on Kentucky lake
And I threw the winning touchdown pass the night that we won state
And I'm still signin' autographs after all these years
Oh yeah, guess I'm gonna need yours, sign um here
I've been thinking about doing some acting some day
If I ever do make it out to L.A. can I give you a shout
Maybe crash on your couch
If you hear of any roles that are floating around
That would put me and Ashley Judd makin' out in a steamy love scene
Well I'd work pretty cheap
If the phones are down just ask around you'll get a hold of me
Cause I'm one of the most famous people in the country
Tag
You're talkin' to one of the most famous people in the country

When I was just a very young lad I walked up and I told my dad
A bareback rider's what I wanna be I want the whole world to know about me
In the rodeo arena I'll take my stand I wanna be known as a rodeo man
I'll come flyin' from the chute with my spurs up high
Chaps and boots reachin' for the sky
Spurrin' wild with my head throw'd back
You'll ask whose that well that's Bareback Jack
You'll ask whose that well that's Bareback Jack
The years of boyhood now have passed
It didn't take long to learn the tricks real fast
Now I'm goin' down the road with my rodeo gear
And I hope to make the finals in just a few years
And when my chance comes I'll give it a whirl
Try to win the championship of the world
I'll come flyin' from the chutes with my spurs up high
Chaps and boots reachin' for the sky
Spurrin' a wild with my head flung back
You'll all know me I'm Bareback Jack
You'll all know me I'm Bareback Jack
Well here I am I'm a layin' in bed
The son of a buck jumped onto my head
I'm a-layin' here dyin' and a hurtin' real bad
Now I wish I'd listened to my old dad
When he said son you'd better stop foolin' around
You're gonna get your guts stomped into the ground
You'll come flyin' from the chute with your tail up high
That old buckin' horse is gonna throw ya in the sky
When you come down you're gonna break your back
Then we'll all know you as Old Crippled Up Jack
And that'll be all for ol' Bareback Jack!

I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately, it just ain't my style
And hard times don't last like they used to
They pass quicker, like when I was a child.
[Chorus:]
Somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
And the magic the morning is bringing home
A song for a life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
[Solo]
The midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they blow like a breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

My first lover
My first lover
He was tall and breezy with his long hair down
But he gets a little hazy when I think of him now
My first lover
My first lover
He was always talking trying to bring me down
But I was not waiting for a white wedding gown
From my first lover
I do not remember any going wrong
Just a record playing that old Steve Miller song
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
At a surfer party with the whiskey porin
And the bottle rolling I was on the floor
With my first lover
My first lover
I do not remember any fights or fits
Just shakey morning after calling it quits
With my first lover
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl, and she's free

I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, bells and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
Now, Christmas cookies are a special treat
The more she bakes the more I eat
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop
Sometimes she'll wait till I'm asleep
She'll take the ones I didn't eat
And put those little sprinkly things on top
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, bells and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
Now those sprinkly things just makes things worse
'Cause it makes them taste better than they did at first
And they're absolutely impossible to resist
Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
She gets mad that they're all gone
Before she gets the icing put on
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
Now there's a benefit to all of this
That you might have overlooked or missed
So now let me tell you the best part of it all
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven
There's 15 minutes for some kissin' and'a huggin'
That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees, bells and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe [x2]

She don't cook, she don't clean
She ain't never found the knob on the washin' machine
She don't iron, she don't sew
Says why waste time, foldin' clothes
She ain't never gonna get Mama's recipe right
But she knows what to do with a Saturday night
Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber neckin', tryin' to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
She makes a mean margarita and a Singapore Sling
And if ya'll are into Skynard, she sure can sing
She's gonna run the table, if you let her break
She might pop out of the top of a birthday cake
And that little black dress painted on tight
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber neckin', tryin' to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
We get home in the early a.m.
That's when all the real fun begins
Yeah, she holds me close and whispers in my ear
Every little sweet thing I want to hear
Then she lights them candles and out go the lights
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Yeah, they call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Saturday night
With a Saturday night
Saturday night

(Promises sweet promises promises sweet promises)
Sweet promises sweet promises that's all I've had from you
But a promise is as a promise does and yours never did come true
You've promised me the moon and the stars when I would've settled for your kiss
Never wanted much just your lovin' touch wnd now you treat me wrong like this
Sweet promises sweet promises sweet moonbeams by the tons
Who'd believe such lies bout a foolin' love oh why was I the foolish one
You've promised me your heart and your love your love I believed was so true
Let some other fool fall for all those cruel sweet promises from you
(Promises sweet promises promises sweet promises)
Sweet promises...
Let some other fool fall for all those cruel sweet promises from you
(Promises promises promises)

If I weren't leavin', would I catch you dreamin'
And if I weren't gonna be gone now, could I take you home
And if I told you I love you, would it change what you see
And if I was staying, would you stay with me
And if I had money, would it all look good
And if I had a job now, like a good man should
And if I came to you tomorrow, and said let's run away
Would you roll like the wind does, baby would you stay
My heart is dancin', to a November tune
And I hope that you hear it, singing songs about you
And I sing songs of sorrow, because you're not around
See, babe I'm gone tomorrow, Baby follow me down
I don't know why I have to, but this man must move on
I love my time here, didn't know 'til I was gone
November shadows, shade November change
November spells sweet memory, the season blue remains
November spells sweet memory, the season blue remains
Your yellow hair is like the sunlight, however sweet it shines
Bit by the cold of December, I'm warm beside your smile

He's a rodeo hand a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all a cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
Now most athletes take vitamin C, alfalfa pills and super B's
The cowboy's don't need all that modern stuff
A cowboy's gotta be lean and mean, he trains on caffeine and nicotine
And them all night drives help to keep him tough
Well he's underfed and under paid and too damn hungry to be afraid
Somewhere between crazy and insane
A cowboy's ain't afraid to dye and shit they'd even ride a red eyed lion
If you'd just show him where to take the rein
He's a rodeo hand, a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all a cowboy really needs is just a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
Now the only coach a cowboy needs is a growlin' gut sayin' it's time to eat
So tonight cowboy you better make that winning ride
And 'bout the only thing that makes him go is that big gold buckle
Waitin' down the road and a bad case of too much cowboy pride
He's a rodeo hand, a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all a cowboy really needs is just a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
He's a rodeo hand, a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
And he's heading to the next big rodeo

I told the whippoorwill told the daffodil just bout your pretty smile
Yes I told them all about you
I told the little bird every single word that you said worthwhile
Yes I told them all about you
I told that big old melody with shine above
How you roll on big blue eyes and how you could love
Each a little honeybee said there's gonna be honeymoon for two
Yes I told them all about you
[ ac.guitar ]
I told the whippoorwill..
Yes I told them all about you yes I told them all about you

It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I stared at that green water when out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, "I'm out of here,"
And walked out of my life
That was a cold one
I never will get back
Yeah she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer
Short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
It ain't the first time, or the last time
I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time
I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
'Cause every time I see one sweating, man
I break out in one too
That was a cold one
I never will get back
Yeah she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer
Short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
That was a cold one
I never will get back
Yeah she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer
Short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one
Damn babe, that was a cold one (damn!)

Been all around this world
Just to come back to you
Oh my love
My sweet love
It's a long and lonesome highway
It's a bitter shade of blue
Oh my love
My sweet love
And I never had much money
I never been quite satisfied
But you can weave the unraveled strings
And you ease my worried mind
You ease my worried mind
Tell you what I'll do
When I come back to you
Oh my love
My sweet love
Gonna wrap myself around you
And sing to you this tune
Oh my love
My sweet love
And I never had much money
I never been quite satisfied
But you can weave the unraveled strings
And you ease my worried mind
You ease my worried mind

She said goodbye in Tallahassee
I just crawled in my truck
Set my mind on Miami
And my sights on better luck
[Chorus]
Ain't a man deserves to hurt like this
It's a lonely place, it sure is
Guess I never really knew the blues
Ever got this far from Memphis
All the night life and the beaches
Couldn't soothe my achin' soul
And how I ended up in Key West
God and the liquor only know
[Chorus]
Now I've run out of road
So I guess my only hope
Is to trade this truck for a boat
[Chorus]
Ever got this far from Memphis
Man, I'm a long ways from Memphis

Oh i imagine
I've broken a couple of hearts
Sure i've had moments
Sudden feelin' hit me too hard
I don't wanna be bitter anymore
Wanna let the sunshine in my door
I don't wanna be too happy
Just enough to keep me goin'
Cause it won't feel like home
Without something to hold me back
Without something to pull behind me
No it won't be the same
Without a reason to say goodbye
Without a reason to cry
I've clung to the anchor
When they tried to be my rescue
And i've taken the wrong turn on occasion
I could see the thing come crashin' down
There was nothin' left there anyhow
I don't wanna be too happy
Just enough to tide me over

And love can be too kind
The truth may find you
Running from the way you feel inside
[Chorus:]
Say it to me now
Say it to me anyway
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Say it to me now
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Of knowing what's in your heart
Eyes are like windows
Oh, and I've tried, but I can't see
What makes you cry
Your eyes closed
And stay a million miles away from me
[Chorus]
Say it to me now
Say it to me anyway
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Say it to me now
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Of knowing what's in your heart

We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love with open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun
When I look back I'm glad we found each other
With no regrets along the way
And what was like and endless summer
Its just yesterday
And even if its not forever
We were meant to be together
Even if its only for a while
We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love with open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun

O God of loveliness, O Lord of Heaven above
How worthy to possess my heart's devoted love
So sweet thy countenance, so gracious to behold
That one, one only glance to me were bliss untold
To think thou art my God, o thought forever blest
My heart has overflowed this joy within my breast
My soul so full of bliss, plunged in a rolling sea
Deep in the sweet abyss of holy charity
O loveliness supreme and beauty shining bright
O ever flowing stream and ocean of delight
This faith by which I live, my truest life above
To thee alone I give my undivided love
Amen

I sang Dixie as he died
The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
I sang Dixie as he died
He said way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street
he drew a dying breath
laid his head against my chest
Please Lord take his soul back home to Dixie
I sang Dixie as he died
The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie as he died
He said listen to me son while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see what life here has done to me
Then he closed those old blue eyes
And fell limp against my side
No more pain, now he's safe back home in Dixie

It's a sad day in Floyd County, Mr. Jones
Yeah, the grief is strong for the man that's gone
And at the grave his woman cries and she moans
'Cause it's a sad day in Floyd County, Mr. Jones
The six children he raised are all weepin'
For this soft-spoken mountain man
Who fed them with the money he earned in those black mines
And the food he could raise with his hands
Chorus
Though the world knew nothing of his wisdom
Or the honest and simple things he did
There's some folks cryin' on this hillside today
That know about the humble way he lived
Chorus
Now this house in the holler stands empty
Though his presence in my memory is plain
You know that I'd swear that I just saw him walkin' up that hill
I guess this place just won't never be the same
Chorus

Cold gray dawn, steel blue day sunset rust tonight
It's the same old picture to a love struck man
Who's suddenly seen the light
And I miss that girl
Yeah I miss that girl
I guess I moved too slow and thought too fast
And lost what might have been
Now I face the pain of a wounded heart
Dyin' to try again
But I missed my chance and now she's gone
Life's too short and the odds too long to miss that girl
Well I miss that kiss and I miss that smile
A miss like this is a million miles
And I miss that girl
Yeah I miss that girl
Sometimes I hear that voice and see those eyes
And I remember when those arms were open wide
It's like I missed the phone by half a ring
I missed the point of this whole dang thing
And I miss that girl
Yeah I miss that kiss and I miss that smile
A miss like this is a million miles
And I miss that girl
Oh I miss that girl
Yeah I miss that kiss and I miss that smile
A miss like this is a million miles
And I miss that girl
Oh I miss that girl
Oh I miss that girl

Yeah, he was sitting by me at the beach front bar
He seemed pretty tore up so I bought him a beer
And we lit up a couple of Cuban cigars
Well, a couple beers in we was gettin' profound
He said, "A guy like me likes the simple things
That I can wrap my head around"
I didn't know where he was going but I began to understand
When he stood up on his stool like a fool and started hollerin' at the band
So play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin'
A few about losin', lyin' and leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong
And play it all night long but don't play me no love songs
Don't play me no love songs
He said, "Wait a minute man, I know who you are
Ain't, ain't you that fella on the TV in a cowboy hat always playing guitar"
I said, "Yeah that's me", I thought "Boy, there goes that"
He didn't want a CD or a picture of me autographed
No, all he asked was
Play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin'
A few about losin', lyin' and leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong
And play it all night long but don't play me no love songs
Don't play me no love songs
No gonna last forever smilin', dancin', laughin'
Hey, let me hear about how it really happens
Play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin'
A few about losin', lyin' and leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong
Play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin'
A few about losin', lyin' and leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong
She done me wrong, don't play me no love songs
Don't play me no love songs
Don't play me no love songs
Don't play me no love songs

Every time I hear the midnight trains rollin' out to the open plains
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the fever
Every time I sparrow flies up into the endless skies
Something down inside me cries I get the fever
I get the fever to pack up and leave here wander wild like the wind
This town's too full of mem'ries of cruel love
And I can't stand it seein' her with him
Every time I hear a buddy say he's put lots of dust and clay
Between him and yesterday I get the fever
I get the fever to pack and leave here and I think maybe I'll do just that tomorrow
This town's too full of mem'ries of cruel love
Everywhere I turn there's pain and sorrow

You spread your love like broken glass
Beautiful to see
Lead me down the garden path
Trying to make me bleed
Is that any way to treat your lover
Is that any way to treat your lover
You say I have your heart and soul
And will not be denied
But on those nights I need you so
It's never a good time
Is that any way to treat your lover
Is that any way to treat your lover
Now would the stars ever so ungrateful to the sky
Would the sun ever be too proud to let the moon shine it's light
Would the wind ever be jealous of the breeze
Tell me why do you do these things to me
Tell me why do you do act that way to me
Is that any way to treat your lover
Is that any way to treat your lover

Blues outside my door
I don't even know if it's raining
But I've been here before
And I don't wanna be here again
Ev'ry now and then
voices on the wind
call me back to the first time
far away and clear
you can hear the tear drops
falling for the last in love.
If I let you down
All I can say is "I'm sorry"
Now it's' all over town
So I don't want to hear it from you
Please don't look away it's hard enough to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Falling for the last in love.

It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I hear the voice my sweet momma called me
Telling me to change my ways
In my mind, I smell the dogwood blooming
Takes me back to yesterday
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I left behind the person that I once was
I changed for good and some for bad
I've wasted days and nights on love forgotten
I've traded happiness for sad
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've felt the hurt of a broken heart inside me
I've felt the joy of love unchained
I've seen the rain wash away a mountain
Like tears have washed away my pain
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've watched some loved ones dear to my heart dying
I've heard a newborn baby's cry
I've walked a path of glory and of darkness
I've felt the guilt of a senseless life
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
Drank to forget and I've drank to remember
And I've drank for love and I've drank for hate
I've danced alone with a full moon up above me
Lighting the way to heaven's gate
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've felt the love of Jesus shining on me
I've felt the devil's wicked ways
Prayed for forgiveness, prayed for redemption
Prayed just to make it through the day
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home

I'm a cosmic cowboy
A big time player
I like Pantera, Kid Rock, and Slayer
I like Ice-T the rapper I mean
When it comes to drinkin' I like Jim Beam
I play well strung guitars with a rebel flag
But I don't wear make-up or dress in drag
I smoke a lot, I'm a whiskey drinker
I ain't no hick songwriter
I'm a pretty neat thinker
I'm glad you came to see me put on a show
My name is David Allan Coe I came to let you know that..
[Chorus]
I've been tryin' to have a real good time
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind
I've been tryin' to have a real good time
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind
I own my own limosuine and a Cadillac
I got a million dollar tour bus and that's a fact
I ain't broke but I ain't rich
I call women honey not hoe or bitch
I'm into Tanya Tucker, Twisted Brown Truck
The Allman Brothers Band and Marshall Tucker
I'm not in this for money I do it for fun
And I don't shoot dope but I will shoot my gun
I ain't no phony dude
I'm the real thing baby
Just like Rob Zombie just like Slim Shady
[Chorus]
And I've been tryin' to have a real good time
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind
I've been tryin' to have a real good time
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind
You know I love Uncle Kracker he's a cool DJ
I like Prince Purple Rain, Henry's Purple Haze
I like Hank Williams Sr., Hank the third and his dad
Hank Williams Jr. I mean he's bad
Willie Nelson, Waylon too
I like newgrass, bluegrass, and Emmylou
I like Pete Seeger, Bob Seeger, Motorhead
Natalie Cole, Neal Monroe, and the Grateful Dead
You know I tri

Now love is pouring through the windows
Comin' through the door
I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceilin' up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love
All my life my hear's been walked on
Women said they loved me my how they talked tellin` me lies
And fillin` my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold of myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin` to pull the wool over my eyes
I found you then the skies turned blue
I'm livin` in a house of love
Once I lived in a hole like a rabbit
I couldn't find love the blues were a habit
A lonely man and I couldn't understand
Why everything I tried went wrong
'Til you came alone bless your heart and showed me the right way
You dried my eyes and truned my night to day
And I'm so proud I want to holler our loud
Tell the world about my house of love

Just let me tell you how a liar will do
He's always coming with something new
He'll steal your heart with false pretense
Making out like he's your bosom friend
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
When a liar takes the notion to bend the truth
He'll lay around his neighbors and get the news
And nearly every day when you look out
You can see that liar coming to your house
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
He'll tell you such a lie, it'll surprise your mind
He'll mix a little truth for to make it shine
When he gets his business fixed just right
Then that liar's going to cause a fight
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
He studies up a lie, he'll tell it so smooth
You'll think absolutely that it must be true
And he'll urge you out for to trace the tale
And if you don't mind, you'll be put in jail
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
When everything's in perfect peace
Then comes that liar with his deceit
A hypocrite liar both keeps up a fuss
They're both very bad but a liar's the worse
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
If you don't want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone

I can't work late although I need the money
Gotta get home to my loving honey
She'll be there waiting, waiting impatiently
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Usually I meet with the boys of Friday
Only this morning she said this is my day
The look she gave me sent a shiver down into my soul
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
I'm a songwriter a professional dreamer
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer
I should know if anybody knows at all
When love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
So I gotta go, I gotta get home early
Be with my woman, soft and curvy
Makes me feel like a king and not a regular Joe
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll

Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
Surrounded by strangers
She don't know the dangers
One drink could lead to two
And if she fails, it's all my fault
For doin' a good woman wrong
I can't be far behind her
Oh Lord, help me find her
Before my angel is gone
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that Heaven without her
Feels like Hell tonight
Last night when she left I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far
Now I'm not sure how long her tears could last
In a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at any time
I don't know what I would do
If I were to lose that precious angel of mine
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that Heaven without her
Feels like Hell tonight

Does anyone remember, does anybody care, the days we danced together with feathers in our hair. Rivers ran together, to sing a crystal tune, stones skipped on the water, circles around the moon.
Chorus: Oooh hey yea yea- when the full moon shines the mountains pines are swaying. ooh yea yea- close your eyes and listen to the guitars playing - little mountain girl
Built a box together, filled it full of songs, and buried it on the mountain beneath a pile of bones. Then we said goodbye forever, to the hell that was our home and set out across the flatlands, for 40 years to roam
Chorus

Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go
Didn't you believe me when I loved you
I guess you thought we were playing games
All this time I tried to think I've known you
I guess I really only knew your name
Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go
I thought you knew I lived my life just for you
There was just no price to big to pay
And even though I know I still live for you
The feeling's that you show won't let me stay

Wheels turn like my memories
And the head-lights shine like my used-to-be's
And time, time's taking way too long
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone
[Chorus]
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears
Are a hundred miles from here
I, I told her I had to go
And now I know what I didn't know
And this road could lead me back to your door
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more
[Chorus]

I can't be called
Begged or bought
If you want to be my
Johnny on the spot
[Chorus]
Honey now now now
Honey now now now
You know later won't
Do me no good anyhow
Honey now now now
Front door's shut
Back door too
Blind's pulled down
What you gonna do
[Chorus]
You take your time
And get me sore
Tell me what you want
To keep waiting for
[Chorus]
Now now now
Now now now
Now now now
You know later won't
Do me no good anyhow
Honey now now now

She never meant for him to love her
He only wanted to feel her touch
And now he's in way over his head
And he loves her way too much
Way too much
Her heart is restless as the wild horses
That roam the plains in clouds of dust
Some men would try to break her spirits
But he loves her way too much
Way too much
Way too much to feel the danger
Way too much to sheild his heart
Too far gone to ever want to change her
'Cause he loves her way too much
Way too much
In peaceful sleep his arms around her
The tender smile she's learned to trust
He's unaware but the truth astounds him
She loves him way too much
Way too much
Way too much to feel the danger
Way too much to sheild her heart
Too far gone to ever want to change him
'Cause she loves him way too much
Way too much
Way too much to feel the danger
Way too much to sheild his heart
Too far gone to ever want to change her
'Cause he loves her way too much
Way too much
Way too much

Sometimes I don't know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin'
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
I came of age and I found a girl
In a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, bought some wine
And hopped a train
Seemed easier than just waitin' around to die
A friend said he knew
Where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and brother did we fly
The posse caught up with me
And drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years I've been waitin' around to die

I do my best to fit in
I work hard for the man
Big city corporate land under my feet
But when the week is through
I get back my country roots
They can all just kiss my Tony Lama boots
Im being me
And im goin back, im goin back
Chorus
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the honky tonks
Back to that dirt road life I know
Home sweet home away from home
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the honky tonks
I put my dually in drive make my way thru the night
Cross the county line and im feelin free
Cause I know everybody back there
And theyll be throwin down I swear
And on sawdust floor is where
She waits for me
And im goin back, im goin back
Chorus
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the honky tonks
Back to that dirt road life I know
Home sweet home away from home
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the George Jones hurtin songs
Home sweet home away from home
Back to the honky tonks
Back to the honky tonks

-Girl
Waking up with you makes me feel alive.(oh)
And every kiss you give still takes me by surprise
So I thought that I would tell the world today
My life has changed so ill say
-Chorus
You are not a stranger. Youre not just friend
You are not just lover who is sleeping in my bed
You are what I came for, always thinking of
you are everything I wanted and love
-Boy
You wash me with you eyes
You give me all your time
Someone I cant forget and I always dreamed Id find
So I thought id tell the world today
All because of you ill never be the same
Chorus Repeats
-Girls
So many times I told you so
I guess I wanted you to know.
Chorus Repeats
Wanted and love

A little boy tugged gently
At a soldier's khaki sleeve.
He says, "Forgive me, mister;
But you've been across I believe.
I see the purple heart you wear
That tells what you've been through.
Perhaps you know my daddy, sir;
'Cause he's a soldier, too.
Did you see my daddy, mister soldier,
When you were fighting over there?
I thought perhaps by chance
You met him there in France,
Or somewhere over there
Across the sea.
It's been so long since daddy went away.
My mommy longs for him both night and day.
I know 'twould make her glad
If you had seen my dad.
Did you see my daddy over there?
The soldier's eyes grew misty
As he watched the boy's face,
For it recalled a memory
That time can not erase;
A buddy lost in action,
The best pal he ever had.
Till death he carried o'er his heart
A picture of this lad.
Did you see my daddy, mister soldier,
When you were fighting over there?
I thought perhaps by chance
You met him there in France,
Or somewhere over there across the sea.
It's been so long since daddy went away.
My mommy longs for him both night and day.
I know 'twould make her glad
If you had seen my dad.
Did you see my daddy over there?

Fancy satin pillows that you bought for me to place beneath my head
I must admit they're very nice but I would rather have your arms instead
To have you here beside me and to feel your warmth so very close is what I need
More than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows I don't mean to be unkind
But I can't use 'em both and I thought sharing them was what you had in mind
In the stillness of the night to have your arms reach out and pull me close so tenderly
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
[ guitar ]
Still I thank you for...
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me

When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me
Now, tonight the old home place's lonely
Since Mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her
'Til we meet on that decoration day
When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me
I remember the night the angels called her
To live on that beautiful shore
It left us so lonely here without her
It can never be home anymore

Well this town has closed down way too early
And there's nothin' to do
So I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about you
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps playin' all this songs about rain
(Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain)
Now there's all kinda songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight,
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car,
And it sure ain't easin' my pain all these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,
They go on and on and there's no two the same,
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain
Well I thought I was over you
But I guess maybe I'm not,
'Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got,
Guess I'll never know what could have been,
Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in,
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,
They go on and on,
There's no two the same,
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,
They go on and on,
There's no two the same
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain,
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again,
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain,
They go on and on,
There's no two the same

Is it too late now to tell you that I love you
Or is there still a chance for me somehow
Oh they tell me now that you have found another
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now
I know this heart of mine could never stand it
If I should hurt to give you up somehow
Oh won't you say you'll give me one more chance dear
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now
Is it too late now to tell you that I love you
Or is there still a chance for me somehow
Oh they tell me now that you have found another
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now
Now I'll confess I know I've done you wrong dear
For can't you see my side of it somehow
All I ask of you is one more chance dear
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now

You don't know how it feels but someday you will
At the moment you can't see what you're doing to me
You don't know how I feel but someday you will
It don't mean a thing to you all this hurt I'm going through
You don't know how it feels but someday you will
Someday you're gonna know what it's like to be blue
When the one you're hurting me for gets around to hurting you
Right now you can't visualize tears like mine in your eyes
You don't know how they feel but someday you will
[ steel ]
Someday you're gonna know...
You don't know how they feel but someday you will

I used to go down to the Mill Creek
When I was only nine or ten
I'd run trot lines in the muddy water
I'd watch the leaves riding the wind
It was there I smoked my first Marlboro
It was there I kissed Laurie Jones
I'd lie in the tall grass for hours
I'd walk in the shallows, I'd skim those stones
And one day I was a climbing in the railroad trestle
I heard the sound of a coming train
Man, it was on me like a rolling thunder
Lit a fear inside I can't explain
Sent me running, sent me screaming
Like a wild man through the tall grass
Trying to make it back home
And it was then I ran into that stranger
With his suitcase and his walking cane
He put his hand on my little shoulder
And since that day, I ain't been the same
Sends me running, sends me screaming
Down a freeway, down a runway
Trying to make it back home
And here I stand, in this darkened hallway
My baby's sleeping, dreaming soft and low
I feel his hand on my shoulder
Like that day, down by the Mill Creek, long ago

Words by Frederico Garcia Lorca
On the darkened stage
Parralla maintains
A conversation with death
And the people are
Inhaling her sobs
And in the green mirror
Her long silk train
Sways back and forth
Lamps of crystal and green mirrors
She calls death but death never comes
Lamps of crystal and green mirrors
She calls death but death never comes
And she calls out again
And she calls out again

(Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in)
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without your love just isn't life at all
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much if I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
And from that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to find somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too
Walk out backwards
Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in

I said goodbye to you this mornin'
With only these words to explain
I said I'd found someone I love better
But I still hear your voice call my name
I thought I heard you callin' my name
Funny, I still feel this way.
Your voice seem so close, but I knew
That by now you were many miles away
I walk through the streets of the city
People passing by think it's so strange
I'm talkin' but there's no one beside me
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you callin' my name
Funny I still feel this way
Your voice seems so close but I knew
That by now you're many miles away

My heart is sad my soul is weary
While sailing oe'are life's rugged plain
The clouds are dark the day is dreary
It seems
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
Bear me over the deep to heaven above
When the shadows shall fall and the savior shall call
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
There is no earthly friend to guide me
No one to call to heaven's goal
But Christ the savior stands beside me
To cheer and comfort my poor soul
At last the harbor I am nearing
I see the lights along the shore
I hear my friends and loved ones cheering
I'll soon be safe for ever more

Life holds no fascination
Without you here with me
Each hour's eternity
And friends are small consolation
Talk doesn't ease the pain
The hurt can't be explained
Only a lonely heart knows
How the memory cuts like a knife
Since you walked out of my life
I'm half crazy day and night
And only a lonely heart knows
How the heartache, it grows and grows
Oh, how long does it take till the heartache goes?
Only a lonely, only a lonely heart knows
Time is a friend and an enemy
In time the hurt might end
Till then the walls close in
I'm so lost, I'm numbed by your leaving me
I sit alone and stare
You don't know till you've been there
And only a lonely heart knows
How the memory cuts like a knife
Since you walked out of my life
I'm half crazy day and night
And only a lonely heart knows
How the heartache, it grows and grows
Oh, how long does it take till the heartache goes?
Only a lonely, only a lonely heart knows
Tell me how long does it take till the heartache goes?
Only a lonely, only a lonely
Yes, only a lonely, only a lonely heart knows

Save me from loneliness
Rescue me with your love
I'll be safe just as long as you keep me
Wrapped tightly in the arms of love
The arms of love are all I need around me
But I don't know what I'd do if you should go
So please give me what I dream of
The kind of dream sent from above
I'll be satisfied as long as you keep me
Wrapped tightly in the arms of love
The arms of love are all I need around me
But I don't know what I'd do if you should go

Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I could feel a change a comin'
I left my hometown a hummin'
With my ol' guitar a strummin'
Songs that I had wrote
I was on my way to Nashville
I just couldn't hardly wait
'Till I could sing my songs
To the folks on Music Row
I got into Nashville early
Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty
And on the steps of RCA
I ate a stale, sweet roll
In the fountain at the hall of fame
I washed my face and read the names
In the walkway of the stars
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I waited there 'till eight o'clock
When office doors became unlocked
Then I started walkin'
Down the streets of Music Row
Just a walkin' up and down the street
Tryin' to find out who to see
To help me get on record
And to hear the songs I'd wrote
But I found it goin' rough
Everyone was all tied up
Either in a conference
Or in the studio
They said that I could leave a tape
But they'd suggest I didn't wait
'Cause everyone was awful busy
Down on Music Row
But I could feel that change a comin'
And I just kept right on a hummin'
With my ol' guitar still strummin'
All them songs that I'd wrote
And then Chet and Bob at RCA
Well, they listened to my songs that day
And they both told me that I was on my way
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go

Rumors emanating from the North to all the Poles
Outsiders speculating
Who's designing Santa's clothes
He's the newest face in Christmas
And soon the world will know
That Rudolph's nose
Is not the only reindeer appendage that glows
Stephon, the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa
Should he call him queer?
He's standing tall
Against the wall
Of prejudice and fear
He's Stephon, the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Well, he came out of the forest
And that's why he's on the news
And ever since that legislation's changed
Now they can't make poor Stephon
Join in all those stupid stupid reindeer games
Stephon, the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa
Should he call him queer?
Prancer up in front of him
He's got Blitzen to the rear
He's Stephon, the alternative lifestyle reindeer
He's embarrassed by his antlers
He retains progesterone
And in his mind he looks like Doris Day
And if the health plan springs for surgery
Some day, you know, he really may
Stephon, the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa
Should he call him queer?
He's standing tall
Against the wall
Of prejudice and fear
He's Stephon, the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Affirmative reaction
The world is on its ear
Hey that speech that Jesse Jackson made
Brought Rush Limbaugh to tears
And he'll go down in history
For months or even years
He's Stephon

In my life the piano sings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
Fiery rain and rubies cooling in the sun
Now I see that my world has only begun
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
When I'm feeling high or I'm feeling low
Or there is no change
Somehow days keep melting into the night
And there's always light on the cosmic range
I am always high I am always low
There is always change
Hear the strings are bending in harmony
Not so far from the breaking on the cosmic range
In my life the piano sings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
Fiery rain and rubies cooling in the sun
Now I see that my world has only begun
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings

Your love just came to visit
Your memory came to stay
It's a shame that being gone
Don't mean you went away
For me it won't be over
'Til the day I find
That one of us has gone out of my mind
I'll give up on loving you
Or else I'll go insane
It really makes no difference
As long as there's no pain
I know it's just a matter
Of misery and time
'Til one of us has gone out of my mind
Either I'll forget or I'll go crazy
One way or another
I'm gonna leave you behind
I know that I'll be tortured
By your memory
'Til one of us has gone out of my mind

Well I ain't been loved in a month of Sundays ever since you left me blue and lonely
Tried to find somebody else but none would do
My poor heart keeps on a yearnin' for your sweet love just started burnin'
I ain't been warmed in a month of Sundays what about you
Well a month of Sundays don't seem long when they're filled with love that's strong
But each one seems forever when you're blue
Well we both done a lot of things that we shouldn't
Could've made up but we just wouldn't
I ain't been loved in a month of Sundays what about you
Well I traveled all over this big wide land looking for another just like I've planned
But no one that I found compares with you
Now I know I'll never love someone new baby do you feel the way I do
I ain't been loved in a month of Sundays what about you
Well a month of Sundays

It's the plan of most
To discover that magnificent ghost
When did I get perverted
And my innocent eyes diverted
From the view so grand
Imbued with distractions
I'm greedy like Senior Babbitt
I'm just chasing that electric rabbit
I'm a reluctant rebel
I just want to be Aaron Neville
With a crown on my head
And my denim shirt all dark with sweat
I'm just pushing the paint around
On advice from your lying mouth
You touched me and then you ran
And left some sad Peter Pan
All alone and awkward
But a transformation, I swear it will occur

You say your heart is in ruins
No way that it can get worse
I've already done what you're doing
And each time feels like the first
You'll start to lose out of habit
You might even bet that you can win
Maybe you just never really had it
I've already lost it time and again
You think you've got something to cry about
You say your heart's got scars that you can't even see
I'll give you something to cry about
'Cause all I've got is a hole where my heart used to be
I've lost a long line of lovers
And I'd fall for more of the same
You can spend your lifetime looking for others
Still Looking, that's my middle name
You think you've got something to cry about
You say your heart's got scars that you can't even see
I'll give you something to cry about
'Cause all I've got is a hole where my heart used to be
You think you've got something to cry about
You say your heart's got scars that you can't even see
I'll give you something to cry about
'Cause all I've got is a hole where my heart used to be
You think you've got something to cry about
I'll give you something to cry about
You think you've got something to cry about
I'll give you something to cry about

I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside, it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake?
There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear.
I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

This tie's fitting just a little too tight
Might have had one too many last night
I wonder if it's written all over my face
It's been a little while since I've seen this place
Still I'm sitting here in the back row
Like a long lost son is come back home
When I bow my head and taken off my hat
A Sunday morning takes me back
Growing up under that hometown church steeple
Learning God hates sin but still loves people
The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land
And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand
And one hot summer when I was thirteen
Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
Feels so good, Lord, why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week?
Well, I can still hear daddy singing strong and low
It is well, it is well with my soul
And mama laid up the Sunday best
I can still count every flower on her blue sun dress
I've done a lot of living since those days
But a boy comes back when he's been raised
Growing up under that hometown church steeple
Learning God hates sin but still loves people
The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land
And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand
And one hot summer when I was thirteen
Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
Feels so good, Lord, why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week?
It was soft ball games
And it was true love waits
And all of those amazing things
About amazing grace
Growing up under that hometown church steeple
Learning God hates sin but still loves people
The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land
And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand
And one hot summer when I was thirteen
Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
It feels so good, Lord, why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week?
Seven Sundays a week

Don't bother sittin' at my table
Just because I'm on my own
Yes I'm a woman and I'm lonely
But that don't mean I can't be strong
Once again he's not beside me
And tonight he won't be coming home
So I just need a place to miss my baby
When he goes out to do me wrong
Tonight I want to do some drinkin'
I came to listen to the band
Yes I'm as good as what you're thinkin'
But I don't want to hold your hand
And I know I'm lookin' lonely
But there's nothing here I want to find
It's just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line
Every night's a little longer
Than the one that came before
But when I hear them sing a sad song
I know just what I'm cryin' for
I don't want to stay home waitin'
Don't have to wonder where he's been
He'll be someone else's baby
Before he's in my arms again
Tonight I want to do some drinkin'
I came to listen to the band
Yes I'm as good as what you're thinkin'
But I don't want to hold your hand
And I know I'm lookin' lonely
But there's nothing here I want to find
It's just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line
It's just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line
Don't bother sittin' at my table

She said her mind was made up
As she put on her make-up
Said there was nothing here for her
She just packed up her suitcase
And she walked right out that front gate
With her taxi waiting at the curb
Too many empty nights alone
Too late I realize
It's a cryin' shame it took her tears
To open up my eyes
I should have seen, Abilene
On her mind
Her leavin' me, and Tennessee
Far behind
Should have seen her growin' lonely
All alone there waitin' on me
All the warnin' sings were there
But I was blind
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
Last night the band played Dallas
I sang the song I wrote about us
And you could feel the sadness in the air
After the show was over
I a hand lay on my shoulder
Turned around and found her standin' there
She said after all these years
It's nice to know your dreams came true
And the wedding band there on her hand
Told me that hers had to
I should have seen, Abilene
On her mind
Her leavin' me, and Tennessee
Far behind
Should have seen her growin' lonely
All alone there waitin' on me
All the warnin' sings were there
But I was blind
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
Abilene
On her mind

Down in the valley, the valley so low
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Hear the blow, hear the wind blow
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew
Angels in heaven know I love you
If you don't love me, love who you please
Put your arms 'round me, give my heart ease
Give my heart ease, love, give my heart ease
Put your arms 'round me, give my heart ease
Write me a letter, send it by mail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Birmingham jail, love, Birmingham jail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Build me a castle forty feet high
So I can see her as she rides by
As she rides by, love, as she rides by
So I can see her as she rides by
Down in the valley, the valley so low
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow

Well I'm a loser yes a loser born loser every time
I find a new love yes I think true love then I find out that she's not mine
I couldn't be so lucky this next time as to find me a love so true
I guess I'll keep on taking chances making love right out of the blue
Well I'm a loser yes a loser born loser every time
Well I'm a loser yes a loser

The most famous of the voodoo queens that ever existed
Is Marie Laveau, down in Louisiana
There's a lot of weird ungodly tales about Marie,
She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions, spells and curses....
Down in Louisiana, where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone
She'd go another man done gone
She lives in a swamp in a hollow log
With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
She's got a bent, bony body and stringy hair
If she ever seen why'all messing round there
She'd go another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp come handsome Jack
A no good man like you all know
He was looking around for Marie Laveau
He said Marie Laveau, you handsome witch
Give me a little a little charm that'll make me rich
Give me a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do
This very night, I'm gonna marry you
Then It'll be another man done gone
So Marie done some magic, and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled, and she said Hey, Hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumbling her fangs started gnashing
Her body started trembling and her eyes started flashing
And she went another man done gone.
So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man, you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it'll be another man done gone

You left you didn't say goodbye
You never gave me a reason why
My tears are dried now it's been a while
Now there you szand you're back again
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
Things have changed I've rearranged so many things
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
It never has it never will do you think that time stands still
You won't to start where we left off
Somebody found the love you lost
Love has its price we've paid the cost
We lose and learn now it's your turn
Do you think that time stands still...
Do you think that time stands still...
Oh do you think that time stands still...

On a cold winty night as the winds blew across the wild moor
Poor Mary came wandering home with her child
Till she came at her own father's door
Papa oh papa she cried come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor
But the man was deaf to her cry not a sound of her voice did he hear
While the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
The winds blew across the wild moor
Oh how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn
And found Mary dead but the child yet alive
Clutched close to his dead mother's breast
Now the old man in grief pined away
And the day to it's mother went soon
And no one they say has lived there to this day
And the cottage is left to ruins
Now the villagers point out the place
Where the willows droop over the door
Saying there Mary died once a gay village bride
From the winds that blew across the wild moor
From the winds that blew across the wild moor

it's been a long dark night
and i've been waiting for the morning
it's been a long hard fight
but i see a brand new day dawning
i've been looking for the sunshine
you know i ain't seen it in so long
everything's gonna work out just fine
everything's gonna be all right
that's been all wrong
(chours)
cause i can see the light of a clear blue morning
i can see the light of a brand new day
i can see the light of a clear blue morning
everything's gonna be all right,it's gonna be ok
it's been a long long time
since i've known the taste of freedom
those clinging vines
that had me bound but i don't need'em
i've been like a captured eagle
you know an eagle's born to fly
and now that i have won my freedom
like an eagle i'm eager for the sky
(repeat chours)

I am a poor wayfaring pilgrim traveling through this world below
There is no sickness or no danger in that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to meet my father I'm going there no more to roam
I'm just going over Jordan I'm just going over home
I know dark clouds will gather o'er me I know my pathway is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me where weary eyes no more shall weep
I'm going there to see my Saviour who shed for me his precious blood
I'm just going over Jordan I'm just going over home (over home over home)

It's true that you used to be crazy
And harder to love than most men
And the blood that ran through your tired old hands
Was harder and wilder back then.
You don't seem as tall as you used to
Maybe it's just that I've grown.
You're the one that held my hand when I fell,
I just couldn't make it alone.
We've lived out all the stories
And sang all the old songs.
It takes one to know me,
I guess you're the one.
Your daughter's a lady, a fortune
And your son an heir to the throne
And though this crown we hold is tarnished and cold
It's a symbol of all that you owned.
Sometimes I wish I was younger
And could pick up the pieces and run
But when I look back on the matter of fact
It's a race that we've already won.
We've lived out all the stories
And sang all the old songs.
It takes one to know me,
I guess you're the one.
We've lived out all the stories
And sang all the old songs.
It takes one to know me,
I guess you're the one.
It takes one to know me,
I guess you're the one

Hold on like there's no tomorrow.
There can be no sorrow,
Right here where we stand.
And living only for this moment
All we've ever wanted,
Is right here in our hands.
And some will say that we're sure to fall,
Try and build their walls between us.
No way over it, no way around it.
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
Hold on till we see tomorrow,
There is time to borrow,
Till we own our own.
Walk on and our hearts will lead us.
But our hearts will need us,
To be steady and strong.
So we can stand and face the fire.
Burning higher and higher.
No way over it, no way around it.
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
No: we know that a rainbow ends,
Beyond dark skies.
No way over it, no way around it, no.
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
An' the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.

I ain't had a day off in I don't know when
Thought I might go fishin', then I thought again
Hell I don't even want to have to reel one in
So I pulled my old truck down here in the shade
Spread my jacket out on the tailgate
I've been lying here just drifting away
Chillaxin' with my boot heals kicked up
Cat nappin' between beers and dips of snuff
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Right now I feel like that old groundhog
Chewin' on a blade of grass underneath that log
Lettin' the world go by without a care at all
Chillaxin' with my boot heals kicked up
Cat nappin' between beers and dips of snuff
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
If this cooler full of Bud lasts the whole weekend
I'll be right here tomorrow to do it all again
Chillaxin'
Cat nappin'
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Yeah it's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Yeah chillaxin'

A letter from home came this morning
And each line on that handwritten page
Drew a picture of life in Louisiana
And just how long that I've been away
Dear daughter, we love you and miss you
So I thought I would drop you a line
Just to tell you how we long to see you
And to say that we're doing just fine
I don't know all the people who've told me
That they've stayed up way past their bedtime
Just to see you, sing and play in California
On the TV last Saturday night
Your Dad heard your song in New Orleans
And he told me that he felt so proud
That he pulled alongside of the highway
And he turned up that radio loud
Are you taking good care of yourself, dear
Are those city folks treating you well
If you need anything you can call us
We love you more than just words could ever tell
I remember when you were just a baby
The best years that we've ever had
Until they're gone we'll forever remember
Love always, your Momma and Dad
Love always, your Momma and Dad

Trouble, more trouble can you get anymore
Slow bubble boiling on the bedroom floor
Lonely ain't lonely, someone calling at the door
Someone lovely and she's bringing bad news
She clenches and she cries and she lays on the stairs
Pounding on the earth and yanking at her hairs
And showing such fear at being found unawares
To be here and be bringing bad news
Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
Well, she's told, "Hold your buttons and look at the sky
Someone will fix things if you let your face dry
Keep your face near the earth and your heart beat high
And you may transcend the bad news"
Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
For all hammers and nails
For all leaves and winds
For all love ambitions
And enemies and friends
She shakes her face so fiercely that all her features go
She lays like a monkey unclothed in the snow
And her voice it decays and before it does she goes,
"I will never again deliver bad news"
Something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
Mm, hey little bird hey little bird
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
Hey little bird hey little bird
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
(Hey little bird hey little bird)
Thank you for not (letting go of me when I let go of you)

There's a white Christmas in my hometown
Where the streets are snowy, shinin' bright
And the lights on all the Christmas trees are burning
For old Santa's sure to come this very night
There are jingle bells and Christmas carols singin'
By the children who are walking in the street
Folks are smiling and they're sayin' merry Christmas
For there's joy in their hearts as they meet
Oh, the Christmas chimes are ringing in the tower
Jingle bells can be heard all around
Time for all to go and wait for Santa's comin'
'Cause it's merry Christmas here in my hometown
I can hear the reindeer in the distance
All the sleigh bells are ringing loud and clear
Little eyes are closed in their slumber
They are waiting for old Santa to appear

If I give my heart to you tonight
Will you still be by my side?
Or will you be gone with the morning sun
Like a restless bird in flight?
Take me in your arms
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel
Will you still be there for me?
Or will I awake to a faded love
Searching for freedoms gain?
Take me in your arms
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
Take me in your arms
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
If I give my heart to you tonight
Will you still be by my side?
Or will you be gone with the morning sun
Like a bird who yearns to fly?

Standing in a field of three leaf clovers
Waiting for the rain to pass over
No rainbows, on my shoulder
Just the weight of walking day to day
Nothing shiny coming along the way
Then I saw you and I reached out
(ain't) no more blue, now I understand why
How lucky I am lucky I am
To be the one who fills your eyes
Blowin' away, sails on a lake
Flyin' like a flag in the sky
Bright colored balloons in the wind
That's how lucky I am
(how lucky I am)
Now the road is rising up to meet me
And my half empty cup is filled completely
And I'm drinking that sweet taste of rain
So grateful for each moment I get
To have found you
I could have walked on by
But the stars were on my side

Daily grind is stealing me away again
When I just want to lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolving around us
We'd still be there and forever if the choice was mine
'Cause seven days that's not enough
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Time with you
I'm gone for now to do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live
For time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
More time with you

Every other Sunday at the skate land south
I always end up with my skate in my mouth
Maybe this is the day I can make some okay sentences
Hell, I mights as well undo my laces because there she is
All marshmallow white and bubblegum pink
Her dreamsicle roller skates circle the rink
And this pastel heaven can last until seven or eight
If my mom watches Falcon Crest sometimes she picks me up late
Hey D.J., play the one I know you know
As we roll across the carpet smooth and slow
Ease the neon nice and low
The next one is couple skate only
My friends bet their quarters that I'm gonna cave
But this seventh soda pop's making me brave
Or maybe it's the black lite but the moment looks right to me
So I roll up like Romeo, Juliet say can you see
That video game that's Galaxia 4
One day I'll get the highest score
And I'll type in your name I wanna share all this fame with you
And we'll celebrate with a couple skate or two
Hey D.J., play the one I know you know
As we roll across the carpet smooth and slow
Ease the neon nice and low
The next one is couple skate only
Celebrate good times
Come on

Condemned without trial no chance to explain
Sentenced to be lonely despised
Condemned without trial to heartaches and pain
I thought that you demand me from the life
As heaven's my judge and the world is my jury
I'm faithful I swear that I am
Condemned without trial someday you may be
Then you'll think of me and understand
[ guitar - piano ]
As heavens my chance...

In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display
She smiles n' nods her head
As he says, "Honey that's for you,
It's not much, but it's the best
That I can do"
Golden rings (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Waiting there (waiting there) for someone to take you home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring, I thee wed"
Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Shining ring (shining ring) now at last it's found a home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
Ooo-ooo
In a small two room apartment
As they fought their final round
He says, "You won't admit it,
But I know you're leavin' town"
She says, "One thing's for certain,
I don't love you any more"
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Cast aside (cast aside) like the love that's dead and gone
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display,
Golden ring

I love to say your name even when you're not around
I just love the way it sounds it's music to me
I love to dream of you even when I'm not asleep
Baby your love just keeps gettin' deeper in me
Darlin' you are always there
No matter where I am you're never far away from me
And baby you are always there
You're everywhere and you've become a part of me
[ piano ]
When I have to leave your side you know it doesn't worry me
I've got your love inside of me each and every day
When I have to face the world you know I'll feel so secure
Cause baby I know for sure you're with me all the way
Darlin' you are always there...

I got my first motorcycle when I turned sixteen
I remember my mama raisin' cane with me
She said "Son tell me why you want to ride that thing"
She didn't know about the blond at the Dairy Queen
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to ride motorcycles
She likes it too
I like to ride motorcycles
She likes it too
I always wore my hair just a little too long
Daddy didn't like it and he made no bones
If I'd have gotten it cut like he wanted me to
She wouldn't have had nothin' left to run her fingers through
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to wear my hair long
She likes it too
I like to wear my hair long
She likes it too
I remember ridin' around with my buddies back home
Listenin' to some Country on the radio
When they tried to change the station to some Rock 'n' Roll
I'd turn the Opry up just as loud as it would go
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like Country music
She likes it too
I like Country music
She likes it too
Now I got a big Harley
And my hair is still long
And I'm still listening to a Country song
I got my own reasons
Why I do what I do
I know what I like
She likes it too
I know what I like
She likes it too
Yeah I know what I like
And she likes it too

Since the day they got married,
He'd been praying for a little baby boy.
Someone he could take fishing,
Throw the football and be his pride and joy.
He could already see him holding that trophy,
Taking his team to State.
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket,
All those big dreams changed.
And now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl.
Sixteen short years later,
She was falling for the senior football star.
Before you knew it he was dropping passes,
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her.
The coach said "Hey son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
Daddy said "You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy you better tell her goodbye".
But now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own,
She said "Be honest, tell me what you want?"
And he said "Honey, you wanna know,
Sweet, little, beautiful, one just like you.
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American."
Now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl
All American girl.

I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder the day that I told him goodbye
I never should have left him never should have gone oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he and will he take me back again
Shadows from the streets shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey're end
I wonder if he's missed me I wonder if he wants me I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
How could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time I'll be the one to cry
Will he be waiting for me

You may walk away in anger
Wear your heart upon your sleeve
You make act like it don't matter
Keep me laughing while you leave
But burning bridges won't get me back
If you change your mind some day
Why can't we turn this scene around
Before you walk away?
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand
Crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again
You may turn away in silence
While the tears run down your face
Say there's nothing left to bind us
Leaving love without a trace
But if I loved you well
You'd soon find out why your new love falls some day
Why can't we burn this heartache down
Before you walk away?
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand
Crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again

Two little girls had beautiful curls
Each had a two-wheeled bike,
Daily they rode out on the road
Crazy as you like.
One of the pair then flew through the air
Fell on her little head,
Wiping her eye she started to cry
When her young sister said...
Don't you think I just love you crying,
There's no room on my bike for two.
Stay down there Jill, and keep on crying
There's no way I can share with you.
When we grow up we'll both be nurses
And our hair will have lost their curls,
And I wonder if we'll remember
When we were two little girls.
Years passed by, each heaved a sigh,
Neither could find employ.
Both bought a car, went to a bar
Trying to find a boy.
One winter's night, one girl had a fright
Crashed in a ditch in snow.
Started to cry and thought she would die,
Then heard a voice she'd know...
Don't you think I just love you crying
I recall what you said before.
You're all right Jean, not really dying,
You can now get up off the floor.
I shall call out the rescue service
And we'll soon find out what unfurls.
But I hope now that you remember
When we were two little girls.
Don't you think I just love you crying
I recall what you said before.
You're all right Jean, not really dying,
You can now get up off the floor.
I shall call out the rescue service
And we'll soon find out what unfurls.
But I hope now that you remember
When we were two little girls.

Sometimes I can't put up with bein' so put down
And all my faith can manage, is the shadow of a frown
My soul's about to break, there's only one escape
I look at you, when the world is full of lies
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes
I look at you, when I lay me down at night
And I want to see a dream come true
I look at you, and I know I've got it all
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you
You know someday's I'm tempted to run away and hide
'Cause I can't miss the bad luck that's fallen from the sky
I'm under some dark cloud, and there's only one way out
I look at you, when the world is full of lies
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes
I look at you, when I lay me down at night
And I want to see a dream come true
I look at you, and I know I've got it all
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you

I'm a simple man living a complex life
I did a whole lot of things all wrong before I learned them right
The first time I felt like a man was in the eye of a storm
Watching the woman I love feeding our first born
Nobody knows about the here and after
What really does and doesn't matter
The question's tough but the answer's simple enough
First comes love, first comes love
Take a good long look at her body, she's built by God
Sent a charge right through my soul like a lightning rod
But time has a way of beating down passion's flame
It comes on strong and wild, then it gets real tame

As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins
Yesterday is gone now and panic sets in
With a weight upon my chest
And a ghost upon my back
And the numbing sensation of everything
I lack that leaves me
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,
Your real world away
Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes cry
Late morning lullaby
The first sign of morning is gray and alarming
It's so disappointing the day has come so soon
While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new
I will push it away just like I always do, I will be
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,
Your real world away
Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes cry
Late morning lullaby
Late morning lullaby

Your mind is made up you won't even try
You didn't even cry this time
You say that we could never see eye to eye
And one of us just must be blind
We have our differences
We're still the same
See what we want to see
But you take a second look
And maybe things wouldn't seem the same
If you could see what you mean to me
Put yourself in my shoes
Walk a mile for me
I'll put myself in your shoes
Maybe then we'd see
That if you put yourself in my shoes
You'd have some sympathy
And if I could only put myself in your shoes
I'd walk right back to me
You're gonna keep walkin' and you're gonna pass me by
You say you don't even care
But I could always recognize a real good-bye
And I know your heart's not there
We've had our differences
We're still the same
Hear what we want to hear
Now I'm head over heels in the lost and found
It's a cryin' shame
I thought we made the perfect pair
Put yourself in my shoes
Walk a while walk that mile for me
I'll put myself in your shoes
Maybe then we'd see
That if you put yourself in my shoes
You'd have some sympathy
And if I could only put myself in your shoes
I'd walk right back to me
I'd walk right back to me
I'd walk right back to me

Penduli pendulum
Swing around, beat the drum
In July, I'll deny
The illusion
I'll be gone, beat the drum
There I go, here I come
And goodbye means good try
No conclusion
Pendulum
Like perfect rhyme
Always in predicted time
Penduli when will I learn
Departure means a sure return
Slice the pie, leave a crumb
What have I now become
When the lie is just some
Sad inducement

You left me, I left too
I went right out of my head
The old boy they all knew
They all knew was pretty much dead
You know, they say I went crazy
And by "crazy" I mean mentally insane
I had a world where I still had you
Oh I wish I was crazy again
Crazy again, crazy in love
Ignorantly bliss baby
That's what dreams are made of
There was no hurtin'
I lived life without pain
You'd still be in my arms baby
If I was crazy again
I guess what I miss is
The not missin' you most
That feeling on oneness
That every one of us should know
When the hours were ours
And I sit talkin' to the wind
And your soul danced with my soul
Oh I wish I was crazy again
Crazy again, crazy in love
Ignorantly bliss baby
That's what dreams are made of
There was no hurtin'
I lived life without pain
You'd still be in my arms baby
If I was crazy again

If it pleases you to break my heart if it pleases you let the heartache start
I love you so much I gladly go through a hundred broken hearts if it pleases you
Though anyway you want me I want to be that way
Any price to hold you won't be too big to pay
If it pleases you to see me cry if it pleases you then I'm gonna cry
I'll do anything to hang on to you I'll cry my life away if it pleases you
If it pleases you to break my heart
And if it pleases you well let those old heartaches start
I love you so much I gladly go through a hundred broken hearts if it pleases you

1, 2, 3, 4
Left my man this morning
Standing in the door
When I got back
I said I don't want you no more
Goodbye, goodbye, daddy goodbye
He always tells
I ain't treatin' her right
Her man going out from you
Stayin' out all day all night
I said goodbye, daddy goodbye
That man wrote me a letter
Said momma please come home
When I got home last night
Found my man had gone
Goodbye, goodbye, daddy goodbye
Ain't got no body to tell my trouble to
Lay down in my bed tryin' to hold out without you
Goodbye, goodbye, daddy goodbye
Oh, goodbye daddy
Daddy please tell me goodbye
If ever you goin' want me daddy
Momma surely lay down and die
Goodbye, goodbye, daddy goodbye

The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said, "Sweetheart, remember me"
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone
I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me
You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now
And we will never be the same except in memory
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone
I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me
A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear
A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free
But in the end fairweather friends may break your heart, dear
If they do sweetheart remember me
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone
I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me

Should I be concerned
That my thoughts are dark that I fall apart over nothing
And each sunset brings regret that another day will soon be dawning
Should I be concerned
Should I be alarmed
That I'd rather stay in bed all day than get up
And face the fact you're not coming back
And nothing will ever be the same
Should I be alarmed
Maybe I should call someone
Maybe I don't need to be alone
Maybe I just need someone
To listen
To my story
Should I be disturbed
That my every move is outside the groove what am I thinking
I might as well let it all go to hell what difference would it make
Should I be disturbed

I'm only a dreamer of romance
My love dreams can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile through these tears dear at you
I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
Where all of our dreams would come true
But another has taken my cabin
And left me so lonely and blue
Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me
Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dreams come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Of a cabin sweetheart dear and you

I wake up in the morning full of dread
Trying to remember what I said
I say that I won't call you
And I mean it every time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
I wish that I could tell you why I call
Sometimes it's just hard for me, that's all
I know that it's over and it's just a waste of time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
Memories of you surround me and
I'm afraid the tears might drown me
I think I'm doing fine
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
It's good that I just do this now and then
You know I'm really not a drinking man
(But) I can't bear to talk about us any other time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline

I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
(If you'll make believe) if you'll just make believe
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
And we'll both live in a world of make believe

Looking through these old photographs
Don't they bring some good memories back
Some of them make us laugh, some make us cry
I'm glad we kept all these souvenirs
To prove that our love was here
Look how happy we were, pictures don't lie
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was
Here's one of us with you calm and cool
But look at me acting a fool
And here's one of us on the Ferris wheel at the fair
Hey ain't we had a barrel of fun
And the best may be yet to come
We may have a hundred years still left to share
But
If forever should end today
And there's no tomorrow for us
What a day yesterday was

I walk around imagining the way she say goodbye
And when she tries to tell me I hope that I won't cry
No sad songs for me soon our love will be just a memory it's all over
The glow has gone forever and our dreams have turned to dust
I don't know how I can go on and yet I know I must
No sad songs for me soon our love will be just a memory it's all over
It breaks my heart to feel this way although I try to smile
To think I'll be alone again in just a little while
No sad songs for me soon our love will be just a memory it's all over it's all over

You've gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by
Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close by

(I'll always love you in my own peculiar way)
It would be a comfort to know you never doubt me
Even though I give you cause most every day
Sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me
Although I love you in my own peculiar way
Don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wonder
To a suddenly remembered yesterday
My thoughts could never stray too long away from you
Because I love you in my own peculiar way
Though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
Though my faults may grow in number day by day
Let no one ever say I've ever been untrue
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way

Under the snow
Beneath the frozen streams
There is life
You'll have to know
When nature sleeps she dreams
There is life
And the colder the winter
The warmer the spring
The deeper the sorrow
The more our hearts sing
Even when you can't see it
Inside everything
There is Life...
Oh....
After the Rain
The sun will reappear
There is life
After the pain
The joy will still be here
There is life
For it's out of the darkness
That we learn to see
And out of the silence
That songs come to be
And all that we dream of
Awaits patently
There is life
There is life

If you'd had made a tag on the back
Of those designer jeans she's wearin'
It's some big name brand you can't buy at a Wal-mart
And you from what she's got on
From her Versace to her Louis Vuitton
You wouldn't think she'd know every Merle Haggard song by
heart
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie
Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
Well she comes pullin' up to you at a red light
In some high-fallutin fancy foreign car
Rich lady shades and a little dog in the window
You'd never know she was born and raised right down on her
grandaddy's farm
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie
Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
There's somethin' bout her slow southern twang
It sweet talks me into anything
Her smile, her wink, and her pretty please
Brings any country boy down to his knees
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie
Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl

Spring could come you'd never show it love could come you'd never know it
Life has drawn so many tears from your eyes
You've been used then lost the user you've been branded as a loser
Where did all the sincere people go
When love is gone it will not return
The river's full of your tears the bridges have been burned
Someone took your four leaf clover all your lucky days are over
That's the way you feel when love is gone
Nights're long dawn is heartless quiet heartaches in the darkness
How could scars so deep still plainly show
All the old dreams so delicious all the news came so suspicious
Where did all the simple pleasures go
When love is gone

Though it happened long ago
The hurt just won't let go
And it's burning a hole in my mind
I see her and I see you
And the things we used to do
And it's burning a hole in my mind
I said I'd forget and I tried
But my heart tells my tongue that it lied
Though I tried to forgive every moment
I live is a torture the devil designed
In my mind's eye I see how you made a fool of me
And it's burning a hole in my mind
(Though it happened long ago the hurt just wouldn't let go
is a torture the devil designed)
In my mind's eye I see how you made a fool of me
And it's burning a hole in my mind
It's burning a hole in my mind

Just a broken down cowboy
All down on his luck
Been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway
In an old pick-up truck
Cross Texas like a hot dusty wind
He was All Around Cowboy back in forty-nine
From the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and the women started winning his time
They rode him high and hard to the ground
He remembers the thrill of being a winner
And the days of his first rodeo
There's something 'bout winnin' that don't last forever
Maybe tomorrow things will get better
If the devil lets loose of his soul
He'll be the All Around Cowboy again
So he rolls up a smoke
And he sips his Old Crow
Wipes the whiskers that cover his chin
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeos
He's the All Around Cowboy again

IT ALL COMES BACK TO ME NOW
WRITERS JOAN WHITNEY, ALEX KRAMER, HY ZARET
It all comes back to me now, a starry summer sky, A laughing you and I, alone. It all comes back to me now, a sea of midnight blue, Your face uplifted to my own. We called it a thrill of the moment, and blamed the moon up above, We didn't know what the glow meant, we never dreamed it might be love. It all comes back to me now, the love I threw away, And now each lonely night I pray, that it will all come back to me someday.

Oh, my brother take this warning
Don't let ol' Satan hold your hand
You'd be lost in sin forever
You'd never reach the promised land
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take?
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus, our Savior, will protect you
He'll guide you by the old crossroad
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take?
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate
Soon your life will be over
You'll have to face the old crossroad
Will you be ready then, my brother
To shun the one goes down below?
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you going to take?
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gates

When I get up in the mornin'
And I face a brand new day
I know that you're beside me
Every Step of the way.
For so long now we've been lovers
Always been the best of friends
I raise my glass up to ya!
As we start all over again.
I'll love you till the day that I die
With a feeling that will never grow old
I'll keep my arm around you
When you start to move a little slow.
And our love will never fade away
Our story will forever be told
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold.
[Instrumental]
I gave my heart away to you
The first time I felt the touch of your hand
And twenty-five years later
I still wanna be your man.
And I'll love you till the day that I die
With a feeling that will never grow old
I'll keep my arm around you
When you start to move a little slow.
And our love will never fade away
Our story will forever be told
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold.
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold...

If heavens where your soul gets fed
The your hell is an empty bed
But it's never hard to keep it full
There ain't too many arms you have to pull
'Cause you think that you're getting love
But they know they're just getting some
And deep inside you know it's true
But you don't date believe it, do you?
Do you?
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
These days they call it casual
Well, that just means they'll leave when they get full
Yeah, they say you're cool 'cause you don't care
But in the morning you always cry if they're not there
And you think if they could only see you now
But I swear they'd do it anyhow
'Cause they'll say anything to play the part
But they don't give a damn about your heart
Your heart
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
You say you never tell the boys how bad you need it
But every scream is your prayer
You say, "I love you" and you swear you didn't mean it
'Cause you both agree this would go nowhere
Someday I hope that you get tired
Of waking up with the thieves and liars
Maybe you'll go searching for the truth
The kind that ain't written on a phone booth, no, no
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
Yeah, just looking for a good time

There must be a reason for raindrops to fall.
There must be a reason why mountains are tall.
And why are the stars in the sky?
There must be a reason why.
There must be a reason for rivers to flow.
For beautiful trees and flowers to grow.
And why have the birds wings to fly?
There must be a reason why.
The changes from season to season,
The dawning that brings the new day.
These wonders mist all have a reason,
It was intended that way.
There must be a reason for falling in love,
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.
And why are we so much in love, you and I?
There must be a reason why.
The changes from season to season,
The dawning that brings the new day.
These wonders mist all have a reason,
It was intended that way.
There must be a reason for falling in love,
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.
And why are we so much in love, you and I?
There must be a reason why.
There must be a reason why.

When your phone rings
When there's a late night knock at your door
When you slow dance, when you hold hands
When you're looking for more
Do you wish it was me
Waking up next to you, pouring you your coffee
Making love all night long
Do you ever want me
When the sun don't shine
When the rain pours down
When you reach for somebody
Do you wish it was me
At a red light
On a bar stool
Buying you drinks
When he looks at you, when he kisses you
When he tells you that he loves you
Do you wish it was me
Waking up next to you, pouring you your coffee
Making love all night long
Do you ever want me
When the sun don't shine
When the rain pours down
When you reach for somebody
Do you wish it was me
Do you with it was me
'Cause I wish it was you
Saying your mine baby one more time
Do you wish it was me
Pouring you your coffee
Tell me baby
Do you ever want me
When the sun don't shine
When the rain pours down
When you reach for somebody
Do you wish it was me
'Cause I wish it was you
Do you wish it was me
'Cause I wish it was you
Do you wish it was me

Stepchild you've had a hard way to go
How come your daddy run away your mama never did know
All you remember is becoming a step son to your mama's new man
And you got acquainted with the back of his hand
Stepchild you say the man had a son
The son called him daddy but he told you to call him John
You say the legs on the breast of the chicken was gone
When the platter come around your way
And you had to chop cotton while your step brother played
Stepchild when you were born
Your right foot was turned left with your left
And mercy had a way of taking off and leaving you by yourself
Stepchild muddy water got in your well
Stepchild how come your laughing that way
After doing the deed that you've done you better learn how to pray
Stepchild you've got a weird sense of humor
And you came close to gettin' away
But they caught you plantin' garlic on your step daddy's grave
Stepchild when you were born

I think I'll go back down to New Orleans
Try to bury my travelin' bone
Unpredictable me, like I swore I would be
Nothing's ever written in stone
There's a knock on her door, is she here anymore
I guess me and the neighbors will see
If the one thing that I couldn't do without her
She couldn't do without me
Could I leave her behind, go on losin' my mind
While the good times continue to roll
With this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness alone
Take a good look around, this is New Orleans
A free wheeler's got to feel right at home
But it's a hell of a leap, whether shallow or deep
That old river's gonna keep movin' on
Like that muddy Mississippi, she keeps pullin' me under
When you're in it, nothin' ever seems clear
I could stand on the bank just toss in my line
But there's way too many fish around here
Could I leave 'em behind for the one on the line
Are the good times still gonna roll
And with this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness alone

At last I found the way to free myself from you
And all the heartaches that you left to make me blue
I thought my world had ended when you said goodbye
Till I found three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
I cry when I get lonely and sometimes when I'm blue
I cry each time I think about the times I cried for you
I'm sure that I'll get over you as time goes by
Cause I found three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
[ steel ]
Maybe someday all the cheers will wash the hurt away
And drown all of my sorrow I pray for that day
But until the day that all my tears are dried
I'll have three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
I cry when I get lonely...

It was a year ago
You didn't want to be my friend
You didn't call to let me know
You simply walked away and let it end
It was a bigger burn
Than what I counted on
I always wondered why you didn't try
To tell me I was wrong, ooh
And after time had passed
I dipped my toe into the pool
Where you were floating on a raft
You didn't smile then, you played it cool
It was a bigger burn
Than what I counted on
I always wondered why you didn't try
To tell me I was wrong
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
How long was it gonna take
For you to forgive me?
Whoa baby, it was worth the wait
To find you and dare you to kiss me
How long was it gonna take
For you to forgive me?
Whoa baby, it was worth the wait
I dare you to kiss me
And now a year has gone
It always goes so fast
But takes so long and what a nice surprise
To find myself staring into your eyes
It was a bigger burn
Than what I counted on
I always wondered why you didn't try
To tell me I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong

Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away
Roses adorn their narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay
Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul is gone
Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay
Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul is gone
Kind words are useless when folks lie
Cold in a narrow bed
Don't wait till death to speak kind words
Now should the words be said
Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul is gone
Give me the roses while I live
Don't wait until I die
To spread the roses over my grave
To see as you pass it by
Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul is gone

Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
I've learned what love's about
And this time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can see now I let it down
But if love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around

Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart

Woke up this mornin' in yesterday's clothes
Still got my buzz from last night's show
A cup of coffee, Ready to go again
I've got twenty-seven shows in twenty-seven days
Playin' junk yard guitar, Gettin' paid
Gotta check the set list to tell ya what state I'm in
Go, listen
Livin' Hard is hardly livin'
For a hard rockin', road dog, randy musician
Playin' like the Stones, startin' to look like Dylan
Livin' hard is hardly livin'
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
I'm high on the stage, livin' in the spotlight
Airplane, champagne, yeah its just what it looks like
Chasin' dreams one song at a time
Well, welcome to my world for the next ninety minutes,
I'l be barin' my soul for the price of your ticket
And do it all over again tomorrow night
Go, listen
Livin' Hard is hardly livin'
For a hard rockin', road dog, randy musician
Playin' like the Stones, startin' to look like Dylan
Livin' hard is hardly livin'
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Go, listen
Livin' Hard is hardly livin'
For a hard rockin', road dog, randy musician
Playin' like the Stones, startin' to look like Dylan
Livin' hard is hardly livin'
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
It's hardly livin'
Whoa, Whoa
Yeah, it's hardly livin'
Rollin' like the Stones, startin' to look like Dylan
Livin' hard is hardly livin'
Wow, Wow
Are you alright?
Yeah, listen
Livin' hard is hardly livin'
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

Almost a lifetime of
Going nowhere
Through all of the motions
It took to be me
No one to love me but I
Didn't care
Had walls all around me and
I thought I was free
[Chorus:]
'Til (And) you made me
See you're some kind
Of light
Can't help but see such a
Beautiful sight
You opened my eyes and
Before I could blink
You had all of my vies
And I'm startin' to think
That you made me feel
That's all there is to it
You made me feel like
You knew I could do it
Put a heart where there's
Nothing' and you made
Me real
And that's just how you
Made me feel
I must have been lonely
Though I couldn't
Have known
Love was the only thing I
Was not looking for
Wandering aimless in a
World of my own
Pleasure and painless 'til
You opened the door

Once you were together, now you're far apart
One who swore to love you has gone and broke your heart
But don't cry on your pillow, don't let it get you down
Put on that party dress go out and paint the town
Baby swing, baby swing
It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing
Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing
Just swing, swing, baby swing
There's a juke joint down the highway past the city limit sign
Check your troubles at the door, go on and have a good time
The band can play the boogie beat so wear your dancing shoes
Let that old piano man pound away your blues
Baby swing, baby swing
It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing
Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing
Just swing, swing, baby swing

Well when you're down on your luck and you ain't got a buck in London you're a goner
Even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona
Now I know why and I'll substantiate the rumor that the English sense of humor
Is drier than the Texas sand
You can put up your dukes or you can bet your boots but I'm leavin' as fast as I can
I want to go home with the armadillo good country music from Amarillo and Abilene
The friendliest people and the prettiest women you've ever seen
Well it's cold over here Lord I swear I wish they'd turn the heat on
And where in the world is that English girl I promised I would meet on the third floor
And of the whole damn lot the only friend I got is a smoke and a cheal guitar
My mind keeps rollin' and my heart keeps yearnin' to be home in Texas bar
I want to go home with the armadillo...
Well I decided that I'd get my cowboy hat and go down to Marble Arch Station
Cause when a Texas fancies he'll take his chances
Chances will be taken that's for sure
And them Limey eyes they were eyin' the prize some people call manly footwear
And they said you're from down south and when you open your mouth
Son you always seem to put yout foor there
I want to go home with Armadilla...
I want to go home with Armadilla...

Dang, girl, look at you
Stopping me in my boots
What's a country boy to do, but say
Uh uh
Stop beating my chest up
You're down right dangerous
That shake got me gitty up
Got my eyes what what
Sippin' on this seven-seven
Never been this close to heaven
Got the pretty turned up to eleven
Droppin' them dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one-niner
She's a flatliner, oh she's a flatliner
Dang, girl, I'm done
I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one
Droppin' down like oh oh
Oh my, I see the light
I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight will send me on to the other side
Sippin' on this seven-seven
Never been this close to heaven
Got the pretty turned up to eleven
Droppin' them dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one-niner
She's a flatliner, oh she's a flatliner
Dang, girl, look at you
Stopping me in my boots
What's a country boy to do
What would Dierk do
Yeah, sippin' on this seven-seven
Never been this close to heaven
Got the pretty turned up to eleven
Droppin' them dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one-niner
She's a flatliner
Sippin' on this seven-seven
Never been this close to heaven
Got the pretty turned up to eleven
Droppin' them dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one-niner
She's a flatliner, oh
She's a flatliner
Yeah, she's a flatliner

You always had
A way with words
So you can just imagine
When I heard
You say she would
Be your wife
Yeah it cut me
Like a knife
It wasn't very long ago
I was the one
You used to hold
All through the night
Yeah so this just
Doesn't seem right
I could try and
Win you back
But I'm the one who left
Guess I gotta accept
That now I'm
[Chorus]
Just another girl
Yeah I'm just another girl
I used to be the queen
I used to be the one
Who rocked your world
And now
I'm just another girl
Sure looks like
You adjusted well
For someone who swore
There was no one else
And I couldn't be replaced
That's obviously not the case
Peel away my coat of pride
You're bound to see the sting
Over some little ring
Now I'm
[Chorus]
Another time
Another place
Another girl
Another face
[Chorus]

Nothing is wrong here so I'm climbing up the walls
Trying to kill this silence with gun blasts and alcohol
I've been laughing, I've been crying, I've been living, I've been dying
They say tell the truth, they're lying, Hallelu
Hallelu, Hallelu, praise the lord and pass the ammunition too
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu
What will it take to have this place on bended knee
You run to the forest, you can bet I'll burn the trees
I will poison the water 'cause it's only getting hotter
And we came for sons and daughters
Hallelu
Hallelu, Hallelu, praise the lord and pass the ammunition too
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu
Trials and tribulations, that's just bread and wine
Getting my hands dirty, that does not take off the shine
On this farm to get your filling, there's got to be a little killing
So I am ready and I'm willing, Hallelu
Hallelu, Hallelu, praise the lord and pass the ammunition too
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu
If you're waiting on salvation you'll need candles and libations
Train ain't coming in the station, Hallelu
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu

Well her old friend, from her own end of town dropped by today,
And way down deep inside me something died
When he came 'round to see her that way.
Here it comes again, that same old chilly wind
Will blow like a cold winter squall.
And I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall.
And I'll be drinking again and thinking whenever he calls,
There's a storm coming on, it won't be too long till the snow falls.
Oh I'll be sobersome,
But when October comes and goes and no time at all
I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall.
Oh how quick they slip away, here today and gone tomorrow.
Love and seasons never stay, bitter winds are sure to follow.
Now there's no doubt, it's gonna be cold out tonight;
I've shivered all day, and when I look in her eyes
Needing to hold her so tight, she just looks away.
Oh she'll swear that it's true, he's just someone she knew
Long ago, and I'll know that's not all,
And I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall.
Oh I'll begin to feel the chill of an early fall.

That old picture frame keeps hangin' 'round
Cause I ain't ready yet to take it down
But every now and then I'll slam the door
Shake it loose and she'll hit the floor
But I can't throw a good thing away
I wish it would break
I swear my truck's got a haunted radio
Cause I hear you in every song
But I know what the silence makes me do
So I keep givin' those buttons more abuse
I wonder how much punchin' it can take
I wish it would break
[Chorus]
Then I could move right on
Down the line
Where I don't see you need you
In my life
But you're wrapped around me
Your memory's bound me like a chain
I wish it would break
And this old heart of mine's
Got a mind of it's own
And it's decided not to let you go
Even though your love's no longer here
It won't let me shed one tear
Cause it's still holdin' on to yesterday
I wish it would break
[Chorus]
I wish it would break
I wish it would break
Go on and break

Well this big city life is gettin' me down
There's just too many people around
There's dirt in the air and crime in the street
High-rise buildings and cold concrete
This rat race sure enough takes a toll
I want to run off to my fishin' hole
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country
This traffic jam is makin' me mad
I miss the simple life I had
Peace and quite runnin' free
I want to go home to my family
I'm sick of the clock, sick of the phone
Out in the country my time's my own
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country

(bob regan/chris lindsey)
I love the way you move
Like moon light on the sea
The way your body calls me
Like a secret melody
The way you start a fire
When you look into my eyes
The way you always love me
Until I'm satisfied
There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you
And take care of you
The way the angels watch over the stars
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine
I don't know how you know
Exactly what I need
I don't how you found
The man I want to be
I don't how your sweet tears
Make me see clear again
I don't how you know
I don't know how you go everywhere I've been
There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you
And take care of you
The way the angels watch over the stars
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine

I've got a real important job in a large office building
Ridin' people in an elevator
I drive a '57 Chevrolet with busted tail lights
Burnt out valves and leaky radiator
I wear a twenty dollar suit I bought from JC Penny's back in '62
But I've got something to brag about something to brag about
Yes something to brag about in you
I'm a short order cook at an all night cafe
Down on 18th Avenue and 12th Street
I wear a swinging mini dress that I made for myself
From mama's kitchen curtains and old bed sheets
I've got seventeen pages of top value stamps and one old pair of shoes
But I've got something to brag about something to brag about
Something to brag about in you
When you're with the fellas I know you start to bragging
Bout my hour glass figure and my big brown eyes
You tell your girlfriends bout my good good lovin'
And that's one pleasure that money can't buy
Let's get married in the not too distant future
We'll rent a little flat on 29th Street
You know we'll hang our washing on a clothesline from the window
We'll feast on cornbread butter beans and lunch meat
We won't have a thermostat or a big long Cadillac
But we'll have a love that's true
And I'll have something to brag about I'll have something to brag about
Something to brag about in you

Could your heart ever be mine
Your arms hold me so close to you
All through the night
Your eyes gaze into mine
Saying I should believe you
I always do, I don't know why
Cause you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Sleep on
Could your heart ever be mine
My arms hold me so close to me
All through the night
My heart warned me this time
But I need to believe you
I do, just for tonight
But you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Promised you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Sleep on
Sleep on

Pretty little baby, lying in a manger
Staring at the strangers, who've come so many miles
They were told to follow the star up in the heavens
And it brought them to the stable of the little baby child
Could this be the kingdom of the high and mighty
Is this the ruler, born here tonight
Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle
Oh you must be the Savior, pretty little baby child
Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things
They knew when they knelt there beside him
They were looking in the eyes of a king
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child
Wonder of wonders, there in the darkness
The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus
To the Savior before us. Pretty little baby child
Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things
They knew when they knelt there beside him
They were looking in the eyes of a king
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child
For ever and ever pretty little baby child

You Almost Slipped My Mind
She walked right up to me and took me by the hand
An angel who could please most any man
She said to me I'm free and you're just my kind
And for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Almost you almost slipped my mind
I could taste taste her kisses in the wine
But your mem'ry came and found me just in time
But for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Now I can see how sometimes a man can be so blind
Let himself be led astray become the cheating kind
I'd found myself falling for that same old line
Yes for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Yes for a moment you almost slipped my mind

Master of Illusion: Clinton Gregory
V1
Im the life of the party, everywhere I go
You can always find me, puttin on a show
Seems Ill always have to prove the hand is quicker than the eye
Walk away my tears, before they see me cry
Chorus
Im a master of illusions, the magic looks so real
I can make a happy face when its loneliness I feel
Im a master of illusions, Ive done these same old tricks for years
But I still cant make her memory disappear
V2
I can tell everybody, Ive forgotten you
I can even walk on in, with someone new
I can make a heartache look, like its not even there
Concealin all my feelins with the mask I wear
Repeat Chorus
No I still cant make her memory disappear

Baby, dry your eyes
There's no need to cry
'Cause I'll see you again
It might be a while
Before you understand
[Chorus]
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing, waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Now the pictures on the wall
Will help you to recall
They're not there
To make you sad
But to remember
All the good times we had
[Chorus]
When it's time to leave
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze
And the snow will fill the stream
And carry you to me
[Chorus]

When years seem like days to me
No time on my hands
I run away to a place in me
To a faraway land
When home seems so far from me
Heaven's lights look dim
It's just as far as my deepest heart
Where my heart's Father lives
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday
If I will only listen to the words He has to say
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in my face
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place
When life seems so hard to bear
When shadows look real
The circumstance is your Father's care
Go by faith not what you feel
If you have been running too
Stop now in your tracks
Turn again to the one in you
Put your burden on His back
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday
If I will only listen to the words He has to say
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in your face
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place
When years seem like days to me
No time on my hands
I run away to a place in me
To a faraway land

I ain't going to work, ain't going to class
Going bare feet and kickin' back
Gonna pacify my lazy bones ambition
Chillin'
I'm talkin', jet skis and inner tubes
Pretty girls with big ol' blue eyes
And wet t-shirts on the river
Just chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute
Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Chillin'
Good ol' boys sitting on a rock
Passing a jar and an old flat top singin'
Seeger, Cash, Bo Diddley and Bob Dylan
Just a chillin'
Moon comes up and the sun goes down
Under Candy Fort Bridge they're hangin' out
Bunch of happy-go-luckies, skinny dippin'
Yeah, we're chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute
Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Just chillin'
Yeah, we're chillin'
We're beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soakin' up every single minute
Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Just chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soakin' up every single minute
Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Chillin'
Yeah, we're chillin'
Oh yeah

I never thought it would hurt me so bad
Seein' you look so good
You're moving on and you're not lookin' back
Just like I hoped I would
How do you stop lovin' someone
And turn what we had into nothin'
I wish I could
You make it look so easy
The way that you got over me
You act as if your leavin' was natural as the air you breathe
You're so together while I'm fallin' apart
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
I've seen you out at at the places we went
Dancin' with someone new
You didn't take long to start livin' again
After our life was through
How do you let go of the good times
With a wave of your hand and a goodbye
I wish I knew
You make it look so easy
The way that you got over me
You act as if your leavin' was natural as the air you breathe
And you're so together while I'm fallin' apart
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard

WRITER PAT McLAUGHLIN
They got a road out in Alaska now,
I hear that you can go there.
Tell me about Montana,
With the cool blue mountain air.
I know your honeys got the money,
I can understand your wanderlust.
Brother, and boy, for me these days,
Its refrigerator or bust.
I ain't got no words for going,
I got no longing for your open road.
Don't get found rollin' into town tugging on a heavy load.
You've gotta give me the nights with the city lights, and the people buzzin' everywhere.
One hand upon the parking meter, the other on her easy chair.
I'll send her roses, send her roses everyday.
If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses, send her roses once in awhile.
I'm a long, long way from outta here, but you know I'm gonna go in style.
Well, I was rollin' around Boston town, wasn't hardly anybody I know.
Got to singin' low for the first three rows, puttin' on a lousy show.
Well then I met her, I had to let her buy my lunch, I got the flowery plate.
I'm telling you why, good brother don't laugh, think I got me one suitable mate.
I'll send her roses, send her roses every day.
If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses, send her roses by the dozen.
I've been having me a whirl with a pretty girl,
And she told me she liked my lovin'.
(repeat last bridge)

Therre's things in my life that I've been missin'
The touch of a woman, and lovin' after dark
Come here lately the woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky boys, and she don't have a heart
Bartender, he don't mind, he sits 'em up the same
I ain't ben sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey Tears are fallin' here and each one cries here name
I used to be so afraid of dyin'
I lived every moment for lovin' her
But when she walked away my heart quit tryin'
And now I'm no stranger to hurt
Bartender, he don't mind, he sits 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey Tears are fallin' here and each one cries here name

(Christmas is holy not a holiday)
There's a word we often mention all along life's weary way
It's the day that's made to praise the one unseen
It's been changed from holy to a holiday
And we seldom stop to think of what it means
But it's holy holy not a holiday holy holy not a holiday
So stop and think dear brother as you celebrate this day
Christmas is holy not a holiday
[ organ ]
I wonder how my Saviour feels to look down on this earth
And watch people fuss and fight and grab about their meals
How they cebrate his birth
Oh it's holy holy not a holiday...
Holy holy not a holiday...

I've called from every run down phone booth in Atlanta, Georgia
Tryin' to find someone to tell me where you'd gone
I begged and pleaded with your mama 'til she gave me this number
Honey, we can work it out
Just come back home
'Cause there's a whole lotta love on the line
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
Don't hang up the phone, 'cause everything's not gone
Think about it, baby
There's a whole lotta love on the line
All this distance that's come between us has gone far enough
And now I know that closer to you is where I belong
And that feelin' I'm feelin' inside is what I'm tryin' to send through these wires
Oh, darling who cares
Who's right or who's wrong
'Cause there's a whole lotta love on the line
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
Don't hang up the phone, 'cause everything's not gone
Think about it, baby
There's a whole lotta love on the line

When the rodeo was over, we're all go to the room.
We're drink some beer relax awhile and sing some cowboy tunes.
That old guitar we passed around, it was battered, scratched, and
Broke.
But lord it sounded mighty fine, when john ed sang "cowpoke"
Ben he'd think of some old tune, and he'd really wail away.
Dunder'd play the spoons and sing until the break of day.
Clyde he'd tell a poem or two and old rich he'd crack a joke.
But damn it nearly make you cry when john ed sang "cowpoke"
Someday this road I travel, lord I will leave behind.
But memories of the things I've seen will never leave my mind.
On a quiet summer's evening when the sun is sinking low,
I'll think again of days gone by when john ed sang "cowpoke".

When you left, I never thought I'd say
I'm alright without you anyway
But just because I say the words
Don't mean I think they're true
It's just that it's the best that I can do
I don't go to places you might be
I can't take the chance that we might meet
But just because I've stayed away
Don't mean I wanted to
It's just that it's the best that I can do
Someday I'll do better, but till then
I can't let you know how hurt I've been
I wish I had you back with me
But I won't play on your sympathy
To get you in my arms once again
I admit there are others I have seen
Sometimes I need the company
But just because I'm loving them
Don't mean I'm over you
It's just that it's the best that I can do

Oh, my heart skips a beat,
When we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know your mine,
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat.
Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat,
When we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know your mine,
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
[Instrumental]
You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
Your my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes, you are my every dream come true.
And my heart skips a beat,
When we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know your mine,
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat...

I'm going to let you fall
Let you go to the natural law
The natural law Like Clay in my hand
Like the tumbling clear waves on the sand,
the waves on the sand
Taking light of this body,
this body
And all your trust passes that surrounded me, yeah
I let the arrow fly and this truth pours from me
and shatters everything
I never thought that I could stand before you,
right where I stood right where I stood,
right where I stood
cuz everywhere I go
The moon and stars surround me like a dome,
round me like a dome
Like a dome
Taking light of this body,
this body and your trespasses that surrounded me,
yeah I let the arrow of this truth fly from me
I let the arrow fly and this truth pours from me
And shatters everything

Miss me baby
When you hear our favorite song
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that danced in light to it all night long
Oh, then miss me baby
You want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
You couldn't wait anymore
Left the keys in the door, took my hand, pulled my down on the kitchen floor
Yeah we were that crazy
Miss me baby
[Chorus]
Cause when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason, girl, that you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
That I've touched your heart so deep, girl, you can't shake me
Cause I love you
Yes I need you
Miss me baby
Miss me baby
Til you can't take it no more
Miss me baby
Pack your bags and hit the door
I'm a man, I was wrong, forgive me, come back home, I'll be waiting
Right here waiting
Miss me baby
[Chorus]
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
That I touched your heart so deep, girl, you can't shake me
Cause I love you
Yes I need you
Miss me baby
Every time you hear this song
Miss me baby

Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart

Run O Molly run, run O Molly run
Tenbrooks gonna beat you to the bright shinin' sun.
To the bright shinin' sun O Lord to the bright shinin' sun
Tenbrooks was a big bay horse he wore that shaggy mane
He run all around Memphis he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train O Lord beat the Memphis train
See that train a-comin' it's comin' round the curve
See old Tenbrooks runnin' he's strainin' every nerve
Strainin' every nerve O Lord strainin' every nerve
Tenbrooks said to Molly what makes your head so red?
Runnin' in the hot sun puts fever in my head
Fever in my head O Lord fever in my head
Molly said to Tenbrooks you're lookin' mighty squirrel
Tenbrooks said to Molly I'm a-leavin' this old world
Leavin' this old world O Lord leavin' this old world
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease O Lord beat with all ease
The women all a-laughin' the child'n all a cryin'
The men all a-hollerin' old Tenbrooks a-flyin'
Old Tenbrooks a-flyin' O Lord old Tenbrooks a-flyin'
Kyper Kyper you're not A-ridin' right
Molly's beatin' old Tenbrooks clear out sight
Clear out of sight O Lord clear out of sight
Kyper Kyper Kyper my son
Give old Tenbrooks the bridle let old Tenbrooks run
Let old Tenbrooks run O Lord let old Tenbrooks run
Go and catch old Tenbrooks and hitch him in the shade
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready made
Coffin ready made O Lord coffin ready made

I must look just like a fool, here in the middle of the road,
Standin' there in your rear view, gettin' soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean, a man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still prayin' I might see, the glow of a brake light
But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown
I held on longer than I should, believin' you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood, would fade in time
But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

When my baby holds me I feel so good
I'll never leave her yet I know I should
Though she does wrong I can't say goodbye
Someday these blues will kill me but what a way to die
Tonight I know if I let her go
Just how lonely life would be for me
But I'll let her hurt me let her make me cry
Come on blues and take me what a way to die

Rain on my Sunday shoes
Pick up the daily news
Looks like tomorrows blues
But its better than none
Call on the telephone
Knowin' that he's not home
I'll put on the Rollin' Stones
And I can have me some fun
Start up a flight of stairs
Stand up and comb your hair
Try not to change things
More than you can withstand
Get into something new
That's made for a year or two
Pick up the pieces
Where you think they might land
Everyday goes
Another days gone
Hate to say so but I'm getting older
Day by day
Take off all your clothes
Stand up and wipe your nose
Cry for your daddy
Who died so long ago
Jump on another plane
Today it's all the same
You can catch me in Boston
'Cause that's how it goes
I'm here in apartment 21
Stop by and have some fun
Say how ya doin', ya old son of a gun
Look at a photograph
Lord, don't it make you laugh
For all these changes
What have you done?
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
Sit down and write a song
Wait till the days grow long
And wait fir the autumn wind
To blow me away
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la

I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love crashed and burned
I was there.
I was there when love came around
With sweet, warm kisses
I was there when it burned into desire
I was there when it ran into a raging river
And then turned into a runaway wildfire.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
--- Instrumental ---
I was there when love came in
Like a living tornado
And I was there when it blew out of control
I was there when something quickly turned into nothing
Just a hopeless, helpless dream gone up in smoke.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'...

Her lips and her dress, their both ruby red
She thinks that's how you hide the pain you feel inside
And she comes out every night to soak up the neon light
Her perfume fills the air
People stop and stare, but
Blue rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue rose is willing to believe in someone's lies
Now blue roses petals have been crushed along the way
Oh, blue rose is growing bluer everyday
One more drink, one more dance
You might be her only chance
She needs someone to hold when the night is growing old
And if you don't mind the thorns
She'll take you in and keep you warm
Lying in the dark in a bed of broken hearts

Ramblin' rose ramblin' rose
Why you ramble no one knows
Wild and wind blown that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Ramble on ramble on
Why you ramble no one knows
Wild and wind blown that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Ramble on ramble on
Why you ramble no one knows
Wild and wind blown that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose

Mason jars on the dresser filled with quarters and dollars savin' em for our trip
Around the world but now you've changed your tune there'll be no honeymoon so I'm
Going there without you girl
I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of tequila going down to Puerto Rico in a
Bottle of rum going to Honolulu in a mai tai mug then I'm coming back home to
Georgia in a jug
We'll never ride that bus to Mexico city its a pity well never sail our ship
Into Waikiki and well never share that brick suburban home today I'm taking that
Money out of the jar tonight ill buy my ticket down at the corner bar
I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of tequila going down to Puerto Rico in a
Bottle of run going to Honolulu in a mai tai mug then I'm coming back home to
Georgia in a jug.

When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he'd stagger a little as he went out the door
[Chorus]
I can still hear the soft Southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me
Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was
The smell of cape jasmine through the window screen
John R. and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head
When I was in school I ran with kid down the street
But I watched him burn himself up on bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o'clock news
When I was eighteen, Lord, I hit the road
But it really doesn't matter how far I go

From Tennessee the shaky town
That little boy did good
He's got his name up in lights
He's the top of Hollywood
You take a boy out of the country
And he's a country boy still
He looks down at the city lights
From his Hollywood hills
He's a Hollywood hillbilly,
Stearing along bearing willie, johnny cash and lefty
Down with a sunset in mind.
No he ain't one to try to hide it
He's a southern man with southern pride
That ridge runner just kickin back
Sippin' on the moonshine
You know what
He's gettin culture out there
As you know he's a tribute to the stars
Tinsle-touls's got tensle-ladies
With tinsle sights on his car
His belongings are little chickbutts
And the apple of his eye
Crippled dog and friends and family
Are always by his side
He's a Hollywood hillbilly
Stearing along bearing willie, johnny cash and lefty
Down with a sunset in mind
No he ain't one to try to hide it
He's a southern man with southern pride
That ridgerunner just kickin back
Sippin' on the moonshine
That ridgerunner just kickin back
Kickin back
Kickin back
(oh hand me that jar)
Kickin back
Kickin back
Sippin' on the moonshine

In that resurrection morning
When the trumpet of God shall sound
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)
Then the saints will come rejoicing and
No tears will eer be found
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah, Amen)
We shall rise, in that resurrection morning
(Hallelujah)
When these prison bars are broken
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)
In that resurrection morning
When the shades of life has fled
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)
In the day of glory dawning when the sea
Gives up his dead
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)
I shall see my blessed savior
Who so freely died for me
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)
And our fathers and our mothers and our
Loved ones, we shall see
We shall rise, we shall rise
(Hallelujah)

I've seen lots of pretty faces in a million different places
And it's hard for me to keep from doing wrong
Cause you're the cutest and the sweetest you always dress the neatest
With one exception and she's waiting at home
If I let temptation fill me I know your kiss would thrill me
And how easy it would be to lead you on
You're such a lovely girl you're perfect for my world
With one exception and she's waiting at home
Sometimes I almost cheated after all I'm just a man
Can't you see my world is wrapped up in a golden wedding band
I'd beg steal or borrow and you'd be mine tomorrow
With one exception and she's waiting at home
Yes I'd beg steal or borrow and you'd be mine tomorrow
With one exception and she's waiting at home

I've been known to lay here
And watch TV all night
Flippin through the channels
But can't find the thing I like
What happened to my favorite shows
Where they went I'd like to know
But right now what I need most in my life's
More Beaver
Wally, Ward, and June
Them there Cleavers
Nothin' else'll do
Seinfeld's awful funny
Home Improvement's kind of cool
But what I'd really like to see
On my TV's
More Beaver
Now Nick At Nite done brought them good ol' shows back from the past
My Three Sons and Happy Days are here again at last
Them Technicolor, black and whites
I Dream Of Genie day and night
The only thing that I like more than M*A*S*H is
More Beaver
See him and Wally fight
"Why hello Mrs. Cleaver..."
Eddie Haskell's so polite
I've seen every episode
A hundred times or more I know,
One thing you can't get too much of in life's
More Beaver
That never hurt no one,
I've been watchin'
Ever since that I was young.
Now each night when I go to bed
I turn on the TV instead.
My wife will tell you just how much I love
More Beaver
(spoken)
Ladies and gentlemen Brad Paisley on lead guitar
Bet you can't play the pianer
That's why he's nominated for entertainer of the year
TALENT
I bet you $5 you can't play a fiddle
Uh...would you take $3.50...us sorry
Give me that guitar, I'll show you how to play it
YEAH
Thanks for showing me that lick there Fred...
More beaver
Y'all thought that I was done
Gonna keep on singing
I'm having too much fun
This here is just a silly song
And I hope that y'all don't take it wrong
Do you think I'm ever gonna get me some???
Me neither.

I was sittin' here thinkin' about some old times
Some old times, some old friends
And suddenly it came across my mind
I would like to see you again
Remember how we used to walk and talk
Walk and talk, holdin' hands
We said we love each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans
But the years have come and gone
And a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight your memory's awful strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again
It's funny how a feeling will come back
It'll come on back, make you blue
Cause I just saw a picture in my mind
Bout a time, of me and you

As he climbed in the chute, the crowd held it's breath
He was seconds from glory or moments from death
They knew with this bull, it could go either way
He said, "Let her go boys, and pray?
He hung on for eight but he couldn't get loose
That's when a clown they call Crazy came to his rescue
When the dust finally settled, they both walked away
Yeah, they became best of friends that day
The cowboy and clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles and beers, winning and losing
Laughter and tears, broken hearts and bruises
They lived for the next final round, the cowboy and clown
From Denver to Dallas, to the Calgary stampede
They took all those towns, and a few in between
But it ended one night, in a West Texas town
The bulls either got faster, or old Crazy slowed down
Five hundred pick-ups, lights on, driving slow
A tent on the hill at the end of the road
When the last bible closed, one cowboy stayed
He said, "Let her go boys, and pray?
The cowboy and clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles and beers, winning and losing
Laughter and tears, broken hearts and bruises
They lived for the next final round the cowboy and clown

Now, there`s a place I want to show you
And don`t you know it`s not too far
And there`s a place I want to know you
Inside of my guitar
In my guitar there is a garden
Where rainbows bloom and shine like stars
If you say no, I beg you pardon
Come inside of my guitar
[Chorus]
I`ll make you laugh
And make you sing
And we can play among the stars
And we`ll make love and dance beneath the strings
Inside of my guitar
Now, there`s a feeling that I+m after
So please don`t think my love`s bizarre
But I hear music, girl, and laughter
Inside of my guitar
[Chorus]
Come inside of my guitar

Roses are red violets are blue
I'm sending red red roses to you
If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets I'm blue as can be
A violet fell in love with a rose
And started it flushing from its head to its toes
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew
A new love was born and the violet turned blue
Roses are red violets are blue...

Don't be sad
What we had was so fine
Before we go let's go back
To where we met the first time
One last time around the floor
And I'll hold you like I did before
Take my hand I'll ask our friend in the band
Play something we can dance to
Play something nice and slow
Maybe while we're waltzing I can change you mind
While the lights are low
Hey mister steel guitar man can you make her cry
Play something we can dance to
Before we say goodnight
If you want
I'll drive you home just once more
Park the car then arm in arm
Walk you to the front door
I'll just let the motor run
Leave the windows down just for fun
You never know what we'll hear on the radio
They might
Don't be sad
What we had was so fine
Before we go let's go back
To where we met the first time
One last time around the floor
And I'll hold you like I did before
Take my hand I'll ask our friend in the band
Play something we can dance to
Play something nice and slow
Maybe while we're waltzing I can change you mind
While the lights are low
Hey mister steel guitar man can you make her cry
Play something we can dance to
Before we say goodnight
If you want
I'll drive you home just once more
Park the car then arm in arm
Walk you to the front door
I'll just let the motor run
Leave the windows down just for fun
You never know what we'll hear on the radio
They might
Play something we can dance to
Play something nice and slow
Maybe while we're waltzing I can change you mind
While the lights are low
Hey mister steel guitar man can you make her cry
Play something we can dance to
Before we say goodnight

There's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one
Mama talked to me last night
She gave me some good advise
She said "Son, you'd better quit this old ramblin' all around
And mary you a sweet little wife"
(break)
Honey, look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals
And a-hopin' that I never die
There's more pretty girls than one
There's more pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one
(break)

Boots spurs and a pearl handle cap pistol and a gold mine that dug in the sand
I rode the fence line in her backyard each day on a stick horse I called old Dan
One day my mama she called me aside and said you can't be fourteen again
There's not enough gold in your lost canyon mine to keep you from being a man
You're a little too old to play cowboy well its high time you made a change
So kick off your boots and bed down your horse
Cause there ain't no home on the range
A wife a son and a job at the factory but that never was really me
So we loaded up our old pickup truck to go where I wanted to be
A rodeo clown picked me up off the ground at the Cheyenne Frontier rodeo
That was the start of breakin' her heart she said you'd think a grown man would know
You're a little too old...
Bologna and beans were within our means and a hamburger once in a while
A new pair of jeans is the answer to dreams when you live in rodeo style
One day my boy said I don't want toys just a friend would satisfy me
And I knew right then I'd come to the end when the tears in his eyes said to me
You're a little too old...

She's a buckskin baby made of silk and steel
Daughter of her Mother's heart
Well, dyed in the wool
Future farmer of a brand new start
She could've been a supermodel or a rich man's queen
Livin up on easy street
But the call of the wild
and the solid earth beneath her feet
Seemed to complete her
Let her see into her soul
To pastures greener
Where there's room enough to grow
Back to where the red fern knows
The sweetness of the mountain rose
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire
We all outgrow the skin we're in
But we can weave, we will mend
Stitch by stitch, row by row
We're making sure there's room enough to grow
Leaves were blowing on the pumpkins fattening in the field
She saw a 'we got apples' sign
Turned down a road never knowing what she might find
He was sittin on his tractor when she caught his eye
He gave a wave and walked her way
He was all breath and britches hair the color of the sun on hay
Through winter's hunger
Spring and summer overflow
With love free to wander
where there's room enough to grow
Well, it's back to where the red fern knows
The sweetness of the mountain rose
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire
We all outgrow the skin we're in
But we can weave, we will mend
Stich by stich, row by row
Making sure there's room enough to grow
Ohhhh ohhhhhh
Back to where the red fern knows
The sweetness of the mountain rose
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire
We all outgrow the skin we're in
But we can weave, we will mend
Stich by stitch, row by row
Making sure there's room enough to grow

Just getting by is getting old
Locked up inside this pigeonhole
Breaking my back with my bare hands
Some of us can't some of us can
I don't have it in me
A bullet needs a gun
And in the land of plenty
They need a champion
I'm one more of many
Not a lion on the sun
Been hanging ?round and holding on
Here underground way too long
Losing my mind digging for gold
All I can find as life unfolds is
I don't have it in me
A bullet needs a gun
And in the land of plenty
They need a champion
I'm one more of many
Not a lion in the sun
It?s unpopular
To be unpopular
It?s unpopular
To be unpopular
isn't it sad?
The ending won't be a happy one
I'm one more of many
Not a lion in the sun

They say for everyone, there's that certain one
Out there, somewhere
I'd been looking hard, searching every heart
Getting nowhere
Didn't know I was making my way to you
Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds the place
It was always meant to be
Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you
I know how the river feels
Miles of loneliness, now make perfect sense
Here beside you
Tears like water fall, it was worth it all
Just to find you
And yours are the last arms I'll run to
Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds the place
It was always meant to be
Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you
I know how the river feels

Every day, along about evening
When the sunlight's beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail
When it's night and crickets are callin'
And coyotes are makin' a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale
It's time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale (like a silvery veil)
It's time to climb into my saddle

She's not a kid anymore she can hide her age in these dim lights
Waitin' tables in this bar ain't what she's lookin' for
The short years fly by but oh the long long nights
A bar tends to make a woman hard
Read a story in the lines beneath her eyes
As tips hit the table they jingle and they jangle
Get her by a quarter at a time
She's getting by a quarter at a time a diamond in the rough has lost her shine
Slingin' drinks at least will pay the rent again get her by a quarter at a time
Another man stands up to leave she's always been left behind
The change she's waitin' for keeps walkin' out the door
But her quarters are sliver lined she's danced to everybody's tune
But gettin' stepped on don't make her cry
But after work the jukebox brings a little tear drop
The memories cost a quarter at a time
She's getting by a quarter...

I got up on Sunday morning went to the church at ten
I listened to the words I'd heard time and time again
The preacher spoke of simple lives it seems he spoke of mine
But I was young I have plenty of time
I walked on down life's pathway living as I wished to live
How to beat the other fellow how to get what life could give
Making money isn't sinful having fun is not a crime
So I'll just wait I've got plenty of time
Plenty of time to decide where I'm bound to eternal darkness or to heaven's CROWN
I'm just a young girl not yet in my prime so I'll just wait I've got plenty of time
Before I knew what happened life SCENES had passed away
And millions stood before God's throne for it was judgement day
Now eternal darkness beckons and the name it calls is mine
But I thought that I had plenty of time
Eternity waits I've got plenty of time
To think of all the days that Christ could have been mine
Now my chance is over earth's days ARE FAR behind
BUT I THOUGHT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME
NOW HERE I STAND WITH NOTHING BUT TIME

I've been sittin' here looking at the clock big daddy
Allready you're a half hour late.
I've been pulling back the curtains, peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy, you better move it on home.
I've been sittin' here listening to the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be.
Zipping on a cool one having me some good fun
Time got away from me.
I better move it on home, I better move it on home.
[Chorus]
Better spin them wheels and make it on back
To heaven on earth and lovers' at
Like a rolling stone, you better move it on home.
I've been here cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heating up the meat loaf and stiring up the gravy
Is kind a messing up my mind
You better move it on home boy, you better move it on home.
I've been speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot.
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped.
Better move it on home, better move it on home.
[Chorus: x 2]
She: Better move it on home, boy right on this time or I'm gonna shake it.
He: I'm on my way babe, but the traffic is murder
She: That's what I thought the trouble is at home, if you're not at home soon.
He: Traffic is messing up my mind
She: ... and you're messing up mine.

Oh the north wind is blowin
Soon I'll be goin on my way
There's nothing here for me
You've made that pretty clear
So I'll depart
With a little bit of heaven and a
Whole lot of hell in my heart
There's a train around nine
And the end of the line is miles away
I'll drown my self in drinkin
And every time I think of you I'll find
A little bit of heaven and a
Whole lot of hell in my mind
Time and distance
I hope will do the trick
You're the sweetest habit
I've tried to kick
And I can tell its gonna be hell
I'm travelin light
But that's just the polite way to say
I'm down on my luck
Some say that you took me for a ride
Gave me a little bit of heaven and a
Whole lot of hell here inside
Time and distance
I hope will do the trick
You're the sweetest habit
I've tried to kick
And I can tell its gonna be hell
Time and distance
I hope will do the trick
You're the sweetest habit
I've tried to kick
And I can tell its gonna be hell
Oh the north wind is blowin
Soon I'll be goin on my way
There's nothing here for me
You've made that pretty clear
So I'll depart
With a little bit of heaven and a
Whole lot of hell in my heart
With a little bit of heaven and a
Whole lot of hell in my heart
With a little bit of heaven and a
Whole lot of hell in my heart

You tell me I'm too shy, a bashful sort of guy
But wait till I get you alone
I'm bolder than you know, my arms will tell you so
Just wait till I get you alone
I used to blush and hang my head and stutter and stammer
Even when I tried to call you on the phone
But love has made me brave and love is what I crave
Just wait till I get you alone
Your eyes dare me to try your kisses on the sly
Just wait till I get you alone
I'll teach you not to flirt, I'll squeeze you till it hurts
Just wait till I get you alone
I may seem bashful in the crowd don't let it fool you
You'll no better when I make your lips my own
If love is what you need I'm ready yes indeed
Just wait till I get you alone

Nobody thinks about that stuff like how tall
He might have been or how fast he could've run
They just stare as he rolls by, all they see is a helpless kid
With no chance to live a life but If they only knew
He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Climbing up a snow capped mountain and planting his flag
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
The doctors say no way he'll walk, he just smiles
And says, 'I'm gonna prove you wrong'
Lots of falls and failed attempts, his legs keep giving out
But his heart ain't giving in 'cause what they don't know
He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Pushing Earnhardt down the back stretch in a Daytona draft
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, he's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
He pulls himself up on the bars
And takes a long deep breath
Lifts his right foot off the mat
And with all that he has left
He takes a step, one step
Toward his dream of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Going long for a touchdown with his buddies out back
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, he's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
He ain't no quitter

Last night another held me in his arms a lover's moon was shining bright and clear
He whispered words of love so tenderly
But I couldn't say the words he longed to hear
I thought of you and things that might have been
I thought of you and it was useless to pretend
Oh when he asked me if I loved him too
I closed my eyes sweetheart and thought of you
Well as he held me tightly in his arms I tried to find the thrill that we once knew
It could have hurt to his heart if he had known that I was just pretending it was you
I thought of you

Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting apart from the laughter and the cheer
While scenes from the past rise before me just watching the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me brings along silent tears to my eyes
Oh I know that my life has been a failure just watching the bubbles in my beer
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled a road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted while watching the bubbles in my beer
As I think of the heart that I've broken and the chances I know have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made now are empty as empty as the bubbles in my beer

I'd sing the Red River Valley
And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
Wonder Lord has every well I drilled ran dry
We were friends me and that old man
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives was like some old western movie
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
From the time that I could walk he take me with him
To a place called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes
Lyin' bout their lives while they'd play
And I was just a kid that they all called his sidekick
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
Now I looked up and he was pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like some old men
Drinking beer and playing moon and 42
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
Then just before he died I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
We just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
Don't cry Jack it's only Jesus comin'
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train

Feelings are strange Especially when they come true
And I got a feeling that you'd be leaving soon
So I tried to rearrange on my emotion
But it seem to say no matter what I do
Blue umbrella rest on my shoulder
Hiding the pain while the rain mixed up my mind
My feet wet for thinking this thing over
And it's been so long since I felt the Warm sunshine
Just give me one good reason and I promise I won't ask for any more
Just give me one extra season so I can figure out the other far
Music.
Daytime makes me wonder why you left me
Nighttime makes me wonder what I said
Next time are the words I'd like to plan on
Last time was the only thing we'd said

I was left alone
A long time ago
By my mother, who I never got to know
Faded memories of my life
Have been washed in whiskey nights
And I'm living at the bottom of the bottle
I've spent my life on a barstool all alone
Never knowing why she sent me from my home
Was there something wrong with me
That no one else could see?
What's the reason
Only I got turned away?
Mama, please tell me why
You would leave just me behind
You sent me off and then you went and have my brothers
Before me, a little girl
And they're the center of your world
Mama, tell me, why'd you leave the middle child?
I should've gone back home
And asked her to her face
But my life's become too much of a disgrace
And I got the news today
Saying mama passed away
So I'll never know the reason I'm alone

I wanna have friends that I can trust,
That love me for the man I've become not the man I was.
I wanna have friends that will let me be
All alone when being alone is all that I need.
I wanna fit in to the perfect space,
Feel natural and safe in a volatile place.
And I wanna grow old without the pain,
Give my body back to the earth and not complain.
Will you understand when I am too old of a man?
And will you forget when we have paid our debt
Who did we borrow from? Who did we borrow from?
Okay part two now clear the house.
The party's over take the shouting and the people,
Get out!
I have some business and a promise that I have to hold to.
I do not care what you assume or what the people told you.
Will you understand, when I am too old of a man?
Will you forget when we have paid our debts,
Who did we borrow from? Who did borrow from?

My bellybutton came untied
The elevator turned to stone
I ran with waving arms
Then I lifted off the ground
I took a pill I shouldn't have
I'm not so sorry that I did
'Cause I can't wait to slip out where
I'm lost and can't be found
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
I see my mother, she is young
She doesn't know it's me I guess
We talk about the planets
Then run wildly down the street
The circles and the squares
Are shaking one another's hands
And I'm about to get on stage
But I'm too naked for to sing
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Oh is this a bad dream?
Or the best dream that I've ever had?
And oh what is waiting, beyond the mirror,
Beyond the curtain,
Beyond what fades into the black?
I'm floating in a snow globe
Being tossed around like glitter
And I think I'm being shot at
So I swing and swing in vain
Apostrophes and commas
They are doing all that they do
Trying to reconcile some truth
In an atmosphere insane
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Here I am stuck in my mind, Just trying to get by
All you'll understand, And will you get me
Everyday that comes my way, I think about what you will say
Finding strength one day, I will tell you I am gay
Take me or leave me now, I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change, I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now, I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl, Take me or leave me (x2)
After its off my chest, I hope that you will try your best
Tell me that your fine, Just give me that sign
Everyday its eating me, Always consuming me
One thing on my mind, Is this the right time
Take me or leave me now, I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change, I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now, I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl, Take me or leave me (x2)
La La La La, La La La La (x5)
Take me or leave me now, I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change, I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now, I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl, Take me or leave me (x2)
La La La La

I'm waiting tonight, for you to tell me,
Do you still love me and will you remain?
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
I used to think your love would always save me
And that you'd always stay right by my side
But I can see a change comin' over you
And the tears I cry just can't hide
No, I'm waiting tonight for you to tell me,
Do you still love me and will you remain?
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
I can't pretend that love is just a pastime
And that you never meant a thing to me
So darlin, please don't leave me all alone,
Surrounded by your memory
I'm waiting tonight, for you to tell me,
Do you still love me and will you remain?
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
So please don't let me loveâ?¦ you in vain

[Verse 1]
Storm blew a tree down in my backyard
My axe wouldn't cut it and my saw wouldn't start
Good excuse for a trip to the hardware store
To give that little hottie workin' a thrill de' jour
I know that she digs me 'cause when I walked in
Here she come a runnin' with a can I help you grin
Like a puppy on a leash she followed me around
I left her droolin' at the mouth when I walked out
[Chorus]
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there
[Verse 2]
I'm pretty sure she meant to drop that can of W.D.
So I could see her bend over in her tight blue jeans
I was eye to eye with Taz and a Tweety tattoo
Forced to play a little game of peek-a-boo
Then she led me down the aisle by the pipe and glue
Asked me if I had any plumbing to do
Hands planted firm on the curve of her hip
Looked to me like she was lookin' for a little lip to lip
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She even did that little finger thingy through her hair
Practically undressed me with her Playboy stare
I gave her back that look that she was lookin' for
I think that she forgot that we was in that store
[Chorus]
Yeah I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there

Blue railroad train
I'm goin' down the railroad track
It makes me feel so doggone blue
To listen to that old smokestack
Drivers a-rollin' on
Leavin' me here behind
And give me back them good old days
And let me ramble down the line
Blue railroad train
Leavin' me here alone
You're treatin' me good
You're treatin' me bad
And makin' me think of home
I hear that lonesome train
And love to hear the whistle blow
She's takin' the sun
And leavin' the rain
And makin' me wanna go
I've got the blues
Longin' for her company
It's many miles from where I am
To the only one for me
It's so lonesome here
Waitin' for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind
Enough to let me be his guest
Blue railroad train
A good old pal to me
Take me everywhere I wanna go
Get my transportation free

Well there's a lonesome feelin' that comes over me
When I hear that highway moan
I know it's where the good Lord meant for me to be
A dreamin' drifter far from home
I roam from town to town out on the interstate
I'm always only passin' through
I need my woman's lovin' she's so far away
I'm singin' the cowboy blues
Stranger don't you know I'd like to be your friend
If I had the time to stay
But I'm a tumbleweed a blowin' in the wind
I've got to catch another stage
I strap on my guitar just like a .45
I pray each night my aim is true
I'm shootin' for the heart a lookin' in your eyes
Singin' the cowboy blues
Sometimes I get to thinkin' 'bout settlin' down
Fade off into a memory
Every night that I step out to face the crowd
I know this is the life for me
I strap on my guitar just like a .45
I pray each night my aim is true
I'm shootin' for the heart a lookin' in your eyes
I'm singin' the cowboy blues
Singin' the cowboy blues
Singin' the cowboy blues

Oh, you drive me crazy.
I can't stop the way I feel.
Things you do don't seem real.
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time.
Just turn loose and let it be,
This waitin' 'round is killin' me.
You drive me crazy like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
I can't get any rest. People say that I'm obsessed.
You're everything I want in life, but to me that's no surprise.
And what I have I'll give to you.
I hope you feel the same way, too.
'Cause you drive me crazy
Like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
I won't make it on my own.
No one likes to be alone.
You drive me crazy, yes it's true.
I'd give it all up just to be with you.
'Cause you drive me crazy like no one else.
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself, I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like nobody else.
You drive me crazy, can't help myself.
I'm gonna hold you all night long.
And I'm gonna love you 'til the cows come home.
Drive me crazy like a rock in my shoe.
I can't keep my mind off-a you.
Drive me crazy and that's a fact,
You're the one that's a makin' me feel like that.
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, I'm a lunatic.
I'd do anything for your sweet kiss.
Drive me crazy, can't help myself.
Drive me crazy like nobody else.
You drive me crazy, oh you drive me crazy.

Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton 'bout knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line
Irwin Nichols there with Judge Lee
Playin' checkers at the gin
When I dream about the southland
This is where it all begins (from)
Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet southern comfort, carry on
Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gary William's sister
On the porch Home Coming week
With rusty cars and weeping willows
Keepin' watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of down home Dixie
Could be anywhere you are (in)
Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet southern comfort, carry on
As I sit here, I'm surrounded
By these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be (than)
Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet southern comfort, carry on

Trouble comes to our house
Every other week
First you and then me
With a tear on our cheek
Over and over the same mistakes
How many last straws till it breaks
Oh, we make love so hard
We make love so hard
Scratching at the old wounds
Laying blame
Calling up the old ghosts
Taking names
Over and over same mistakes
How many close calls can we shake
Oh, we make love so hard
Oh, we make love so hard
It doesn't have to be this way
We've seen better days
Oh, we make love so hard
Oh, we make love so hard
Oh, we make love so hard
Why do we make love so hard

Got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love.
Got the world on a string
I can make the rain go
any time I snap my fingers
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so
If I should ever let go
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life
I'm in love

The finest silver needle
Shouldn't ever slide between
When lovers stand as parting friends
Gonna put myself on a leaving train
And I won't come back again
I could wait 'til morning
If it don't come down today
A dime says I won't be satisfied
Gonna put myself on a leaving train
And I won't come back again
The words that go unspoken
On the color of the sun
And the coolin' air of the evening shade
And the breathless hours on the sleeping plane
And the last taillight on a leaving train
And I won't come back again
And I won't come back again

Tell me white dove where will I find the olive tree
Just for one branch I'd search my whole life through
I've heard them say a greener land is waiting there
Where peaple wake and find their dreams come true
A flying dove please lead me and I'll follow you
Above the clouds beyond the stormy sea
I long to share a world of sweet contentment there
In that bright land where grows the olive tree
So let me fly please lead me and I'll follow you...
In that bright land where grows the olive tree

I told this heart of mine our love would never be,
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me,
Somehow I can't dismiss the mem'ry of your kiss,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
No matter what I do,
No matter what I say, mo matter how I try,
I just can't turn the other way,
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you;
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
You're not in love with me,so why can't I forget,
I'm just your used to be?
It's wrong and yet,
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing to do,
For I'm a puppet, and I just can't seem to break the string,
I say I'll let you go, but then my heart says no,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
I told this heart of mine our love would never be,
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me,
Somehow I can't dismiss the mem'ry of your kiss,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
No matter what I do,
No matter what I say, mo matter how I try,
I just can't turn the other way,
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you;
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
You're not in love with me,so why can't I forget,
I'm just your used to be?
It's wrong and yet,
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing to do,
For I'm a puppet, and I just can't seem to break the string,
I say I'll let you go, but then my heart says no,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.

Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
It was a bright moon light night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your heart wasn't true, I'll say unto you
I moaned like a turtle dove
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darlin', I'm coming home
I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darlin', I'm coming home
Down in the pasture where the birds are singing
You can't hear nothing but what the birds are saying
Down in the pasture where the birds are singing
You can't hear nothing but what the birds are saying
It was a bright moon light night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your heart wasn't true, I'll say unto you
I moaned like a turtle dove
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

If a single drop of honey
Would bring you to me
I'd break that sweet rock open
And hold it out for thee
She asked him for a penny
He gave her a dime
She asked him to stay forever
He said "all will come in time"
If a single drop of honey
Would bring you to me
I'd break that sweet rock open
And hold it out for thee
She prayed for him to come back
He sent a voice true
She barely heard the words
He said "I'm not so far from you"
If a single drop of honey
Would bring you to me
I break that sweet rock open
And hold it out for thee

I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yeah I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouth bass have got me hooked
On Sunday afternoon
Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday night
And hell yes I love my truck
But I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most
Man I love how Redman tastes
And damn I love my Nascar race
Any song sung by George Strait
Is country at it's best
Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck
But I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most
I love
Yeah I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken tore up jeans
A four wheel drive, eight point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And Jack D in my coke
But honey I love your love
Yeah I love your love
I love your love the most
I love your love the most

(Dolly Parton)
When I was a child I recall and old man; everybody loved old Zeke
He was all alone, his family was gone; one day he said to me
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
When I die don't grieve and cry
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old Muley and me
Wherever I am, whatever I'm a doing, some sweet day I'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
When I die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me

Your love is colder than a foggy river
Flowing over a heart of stone
You left me stranded on this foggy river
Drifting helpless and alone
Can't escape this broken heart of mine
There's no freedom anymore
Oh Heaven help me on this foggy river
Help me find the distant shore
There's no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrow chills this foggy river
Everything I love is gone
Always knew some day you'd let me down
I've got troubles on my mind
I guess I'm doomed to sail this foggy river
'Till I leave your love behind

A big hearted me, big hearted me, big hearted me
A big hearted me had to go, give 'em my love away
I give it to a girl that broke it in two like it was plain
I should have known better, should I never let her
But I couldn't break free
I give her all my love so gently
A big hearted me, big hearted me, big hearted me
Bought her everything, mink and a ring, oh, so fine
I thought she loved me so there never was a doubt
That she was mine
Till one day, opened my eyes, plain as could be
My love was all gone, she left me all alone, a big hearted me
A big hearted me, big hearted me
A big hearted me, big hearted me, big hearted me

Rollin' down a long highway, out to New Mexico
Driftin' down to Santa Fe, to ride a bull in a Rodeo
He's hooked on a feelin', addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's appealin', all he knows is he's got to ride
He's addicted to danger
Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an 8 second ride
Gettin' up down in back of the chutes, makes that rousin' burn
He's got his spurs on the heels of his boots, he's at the point of no return
Climbin' over that chute gate he settles down inside
The tension's risin' but he can't wait until they turn that bull outside
He's addicted to danger
Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an 8 second ride

There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the dark nest of strife
The sunny side we also may view
Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
Though the storm and its fury breaks today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear
Let us treat with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or clear
Let us trust in our Savior old ways
He will keep us everyone in His care
Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
As I wander through the dark
Through the midnight mist
Remembering our last kiss
Do you know how much you're missed
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry
Dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all two distant
Hearts can do
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
Picturing your face
Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear
I can see you there
Longing to be touched
But you're out of reach
Hold on please
Won't you wait for me
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry
Dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all two distant
Hearts can do
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around

Written by billy burnette.
I miss you darling
In a heartbreakin way
If I could I'd be calling
You home to stay
I could hardly stand it
When you walked on the plane
I didn't think I could take it
Almost went insane
As I read your letters
I felt so much closer to you
I'll feel a whole lot better
When I'm side by side with you

No matter what I say or do
You're never satisfied
I've tried to please you too many times
So now I'm leaving you now goodbye
Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go
Why on earth was I ever born
I'll never understand
To fall in love with a girl like you
Who's in love with another man
Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go
You broke a heart that trusted you
Why wasn't it made of stone
You've left my world as black as night
And yet I must travel on
Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go

She opened up the letter from Nashville Tennessee
He said hon they like my music the songs I wrote for you and me
The boys and me just cut a record and it could hit the charts before too long
So it's gonna be a while till I can come back home
Yes I'm gonna be a country star and everyone will know my name
Oh you know I love those bright lights when I step on stage to sing
I'll be travlin' round the country with a big bus and a band
So just keep the homefires burnin' while I'm gone
And I'll get home when I can
She said hon I hear your record oh they play it everyday
And everybody really likes it so I guess your on your way
But darling please remember we all need you here at home
And the kids all miss their daddy so don't be gone too long
Yes I know that your a country star and everybody knows your name
And I know you love those bright lights when you step on stage to sing
Just remember we all love you and don't get blinded by the light
We'll just keep the homefires burnin' while you're gone
You know we pray for you each night
After six long months of goin' I guess the road just finally took its toll
Cause his songs has lost all meaning and he felt so all alone
Then one night in Jackson he went out on stage to play
And the crowd stared at disbelief at the words he had to say
I don't want to be a country star it ain't the way I thought it'd be
Well it took me such a long time to know that it ain't the life for me
Cause the days can get so lonely and the nights can get so long
Lord I think it's about time this country star went home
Yes I think that it's about time this country boy went home

You're telling me
We gotta talk
That you can't go on
Holdin' it inside
No it isn't
Anybody's fault
I shouldn't blame myself
You know I tried
You thought it through
How you agonized
Though it took some time
Now you know for sure
What we have really isn't what
You're looking for
Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more
No it really doesn't
Ease the pain
When you say you wish
It had all worked out
And being sorry
Isn't gonna change
What I'm losing here
What I'm feeling now
There'll be nights
When I toss and turn
With your hollow words
Ringing in my ears
I think I heard enough to hurt about
You made it clear
Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more

Do you like it when the meter's jumpin'?
You like the sound of them horses runnin'?
Do you like it when the tweeter's tweetin'?

Tell me how you like it (tell me how you like it)
You know I wanna try it (know I wanna try it)
Baby if you don't mind it (if you don't mind it)

With the highway flyin' right under your feet (tell me)
Do you like it with the radio on (just tell me how)
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it by the bonfire heat
If it gets too hot we can take it to the creek (I need to know)
Let's make it last all night long (just tell me how)
Tell me how you like it

Well Duggan was a purebred hill country kicker
He loved to shoot his pistols
And he loved to drink his liquor
His daddy had long since given up on tryin'
To tame him
He knew he hated sweatin' in the fields
He couldn't blame him
But when his only son robbed the Chillicothe Flyer
He guessed the days were numbered
Till he'd have to face the fire
Well Duggan rode up to the house
His pa ran out to meet him
He said "Son, why'd you do it?"
Duggan said "I had my reasons"
His daddy told him, "Boy, you've always been
So full of juice, but any day your neck
It will be hangin' in a noose."
Duggan winked and mounted, stirred his
Horse into a lather
He never looked back... guess it really didn't matter
It wasn't too long till a team of Texas Rangers
Pounded on the door, man, faces
Filled with anger
Duggan's papa opened up, said "No need to shout,
I don't know where he is
But I know what he's all about."
He likes to dance out to the edge
He likes to cut to the chase
You see he's never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where he's bound
Well, boys, I just can't respond
But from the look in his eyes
It's a safe bet he's headed
To the border and beyond.
Well the moral of this tale
Is you can't change a leopard's spots
Don't blame a man for failing to be
Something that he's not
So girl, with that in mind
Won't you step into the light
We'll move just left of center
Till we finally get it right
Remember I'm a push it to the limit
Kind of guy
You may ask me how we'll do it
But no need to ask me why
I like to dance out to the edge
I like to cut to the chase
You see, I've never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where we're bound
Well, honey, I just can't respond
But from the look in your eyes
It's a safe bet we're headed
To the border and beyond.

When I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were going on an eight-hour drive
If I could just watch TV
And I'd have given anything
To have my own Pac-Man game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
Now I've got it on my phone
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future
My grandpa was in World War 2
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines
I wish they could see this now
The world they saved has changed you know
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo
Hey, everyday's a revolution
Welcome to the future
Hey, look around it's all so clear
Hey, wherever we were going, well we're here
Hey, so many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me
I had a friend in school
Running back on the football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today
And everybody who'd seen what he'd seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream
Hey, wake up Martin Luther
Welcome to the future
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future

The Grand Old Op'ry Theatre proudly presents,
Cornography.
Kung Pao!
Episode two,
The continuing adventures of the Kung Pao buckaroos.
The three cowboys needed a place to bed down for the night.
So I suggested the establishment of Miss Kitty May,
(Or she may not).
A former love and a woman of questionable repute.
So they walked into the saloon and asked for Miss Kitty.
And just then, they heard a voice saying,
"Hi, boys. You lookin' for these."
And the littlest cowboy turned around to see two huge 38s pointed right at his face.
(Jimmy, you can't say that!)
(What? She had huge guns.)
Smith and Wesson revolvers.
Oh boy, were they loaded.
(Oh brother)
Cornography.
She's aiming them right at us.
(Softer, George, it's more effective.)
She's aiming them right at us.
Everybody duck!
Not you, Jimmy. You stand up normal.
They dropped the money they owed her, an' she bent over to pick it up,
And, oh, that moon was beautiful.
(Now Jimmy, you can't say that!).
Out the window. I couldn't see it till then George:
There were mountains in the way.
Cornography.
"You guys are gonna get in trouble for this."
That woman sure chaps my.
Ask her out then.
I think he's got a little thing for her, George.
(Louder, Bill, it's more effective.)
I think he's got a little thing for her, George.
It's not THAT little.
(That was worth the trip over here.)
All, right, Jimmy, let's get serious now.
So the little cowboy was tryin' not to act too excited.
But when I look at a woman that beautiful, it's hard.
(Jimmy!!!).
What? It's very difficult.
I hope they're not recordin' this.
Yeah.
Ah.
Cornography.
An' I said: "Little cowgirl, how would you like a little cowpoke?"
"Here we go."
Ooh yeah. Need a little buckaroo?
In your dreams short barrell.
Bum chicka bow wow.
Oh my God.
So the Kung Poo Buck, Kung Poo!
So the Kung Pao Buckaroos rode off into the sunset.
Tune in next time for more action and romance.
Yeah!
(Softer, George, it's more effective.)
Yeah.

In a simple life dreams die hard
You never let 'em go
All the while you play your hands
And you may never know
Why it's always lady luck
On someone else's palm they read
You holding my two hands
Is really all I need
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you
Many things I've come to need
That I could do without
And many more I've done without
I could come to need
The one thing that I'd fight to keep
Until my days are through
Is when I lay me down to sleep
I'm lyin' next to you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Finding I've too many things I've missed
Barely gettin' by without you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you

Talk back trembling lips shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let him know he's gettin' through to you
Talk back trembling lips burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let him know that you're breaking in two
Everyday our love's a battle royal well it seems that fighting's all we do
But if I let you know how much I love you you'd do things to me you shouldn't do
Talk back trembling lips...
[ piano ]
Everytime you up and hurt my feelings I pretend it couldn't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions behind my broken heart I guess
Talk back trembling lips...
Heart don't let him know that you're breaking in two

Would you hold onto my hand when I get lonely
Could I come to you whenever I'm in need
Would you always have a place for me to lay my body down
Would you be my lady in the morning would you be my lady
Would you walk with me across the bridges I forgot to burn
Could you face the future lookin' at my past
If I took the time to teach you all the things you need to learn
Be my lady in the evening would you be my lady
Does it matter to you that you're not my first love
Would you let a thing like that stand in your way
If I said you was the woman that could ease my troubled mind
Would you be my lady when I need you would you be my lady
Would you walk with me across the bridges I forgot to burn
Could you face the future lookin' at my past
If I took the time to teach you all the things you need to learn
Would you always have a place for me to lay my body down

There was light in the room
Then you left and it was through
Then the frost started in
My toes and fingertips
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
Then for I don't know how long
I settled in to doing wrong
And as the wind fills the sail
Came the thought to hurt my self
Come on,
And it spread
And it spread into my home
And it spread
And it spread into my soul
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie
Then you came back from space
With a brand new laugh and a different space
You took my hand and held it up
And shot my arm full of love
And it spread
And it spread into the world
And it spread, ooh
And it spread into the world
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie

It's simple, so easy
Somethin' 'bout your gentle way that frees me
I feel it, all I can do is love you
This one thing I'm sure of
Nothin' sweeter in this world than your love
I'm certain all I can do is love you
All of my dreams are yours
Those distant shores of love at last have found me
Best way I can explain is there's hope again
And you're the light surrounding me
My lifetime I'll prove it
'Cause baby when it gets right down to it
I can't help it all I can do is love you

Chorus:
A heartsong melody play like a symphony
The sweetest music I have ever known
A song of joy and pain
The mountain angels sing
A bittersweet refreign of my Smokey Mountain Home, heartsong
Farmer's daughter if you will
And I often wonder still
In memories where I rammbled as a child
Makes me cry and makes me laugh
My reflections on the past
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs
Just enough to go around
But the sweetest things in life are always free
Like the songs the birds would sing
And the sweet new grass of spring
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
Repeat Chorus
And I recall the thrill and joy
Of a Smokey Mountain boy
I remember my first kiss and my first love
And the songs I'd song and write
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
And in that little house 'a prayer
Where I spent many hour
Prassin' God and liftin' up His name
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me
As I headed up that rocky road to fame
And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world
But it makes no difference just how far I roam
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart
My faith in God and memories of home
Repeat Chorus

Tell me with yer eyes
In silence let them ring
The precious humming of our hearts
In silence let them sing
May our phantoms find there places
Where ever that may be
Let only the sound of love dear echo endlessly
For you for me
I won't wait a week and pine for a love that isn't there
We will watch the river flow past pretty flowers growing there
And the gravity and spin will pass by freely in the wind
To find us quiet in the sunset two old rugged roses
Planted firmly by the riverbed
Let the tender petals fall
Like yer long cascading hair
Let the volume of yer moans
Deny no passion in the air
And from the center of my bones
I'll kiss often and with care
But not every kiss is always placed so keenly

A lover's first touch and dreams of that night
She'll keep in her heart for the rest of her life
Men tend to forget those little things
We're not as sentimental as we ought to be
There's so much that we don't see
Only a woman understands
The shine in the diamond on her hand
And it's a mystery to every man
How easy tears can flow
And what's so special about a rose
Only a woman knows
Those three little words men find hard to say
Mean so much to her, have you told her today
Love's not a game, but there is a rule
Nothing's for granted and nothin's assumed
But most men don't have a clue
Only a woman understands
The shine in the diamond on her hand
And it's a mystery to every man
How easy tears can flow
And what's so special about a rose
Only a woman knows

I need you and I want you 'cause I know you from before
I hate you and I fear you but I hold open the door
I see you and you see me and we know what must be done
So we draw knives and lock eyes 'cause it does no good to run
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
I've missed you, you know that's true and I've retraced every scar
My head sings and the steel rings 'cause we've traveled, oh so far
I chased you to embrace you like the sun chases the moon
I burn you and you burn me but I know I'll see you soon
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
I've watched you and I've seen you and known that you were there
I've held and you've loved me but our lives cannot be spared
I trust you and despised you, shadowed your every move
Scorned you and warned you, befriended everyone you've used
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams

(Chip Davis, Bill Fries)
She was old, and beautiful, and wise, and She taught the young boy everything he needed to know. All about the land, and the woods and the rivers, and what had happened there even before he was born. She taught him what was good and what was bad. And most of all, the difference between right and wrong.
And so, every morning he stood beside his desk, with his hand over his heart, and promised to respect Her for the rest of his days.
When times were hard, and the grain elevators stood empty against the black Midwestern sky, She gave him praise for a hard day's work, and hope for his father. And She promised there would be better days to come.
And he sat by the radio and cried angry tears one gray December day, when he hear that She'd been betrayed. She was hurt; She needed help. He was only twelve, but he gave Her all he could: scraps of paper and tin cans and even the rubber tires from his wagon. He followed Her across the sea, on the maps and the newspaper, wishing he was older, old enough to fight back.
Then after four long, dark years, he heard the church bells ring and the noon whistle blow long and high. And he was part of one brief moment when all the world paid respect to Her.
And then he was grown up; and suddenly, the world had changed. And there were questions about Her. Some thought She was old-fashioned, useless. Some thought She was dead. But then after all, maybe they hadn't known Her as he had.
And now everyone has grown older. The boy, his children, and She too. He saw Her again just the other day: it was one of those bright, summer mornings and the church bells were ringing again. The bands were playing, and even the noon whistle was blowing, early.
He stood and watched proudly as She passed by. The sunlight catching the flash of crimson and white, stars blazing in the clear blue sky.
And then She was gone.
And he looked down through three generations into his grandson's eyes, and said, "There she goes, son. We used to call her Old Glory."

I've got the lonesome homesick blues
I've got them bad babe, down in my shoes
I left someone there that I might lose
That's why I've got these old homesick blues
It makes me homesick to hear your name
And hold you dear, in my arms again
I'm a gonna ride that old lonesome train
To the one I left back in Maces Spring
You told me once dear, you loved me so
And it's on my mind dear, every where I go
I'll soon be knowing if it is so
Or has your love for me grown cold
Oh, listen to that old lonesome train
It's a gonna carry me back again
To the one that told me their love was true
I'll spend the rest of my days with you

There's a rip in the elbow of the left sleeve
And one button doesn't match
You sewed that one on yourself
And at the time it made me laugh
It's frayed on the collar it's so old and faded out blue
And I'll never wash it 'cause
It smells so exactly like you
When you left it I'm sure
You didn't think twice about it
But the irony is that I can't live without it
I wear your shirt like it's your arms around me
I put it on and you just surround me
It's so soft on my skin
Like the touch of your hands
So good it hurts
I should burn it I know
Tear it up I'm this close
But for the moment I just can't let go
Of your shirt
It keeps me warm when I sleep
And those nights I don't
It keeps me company
I've got it on in the mornings having coffee
And after work when I'm watching TV
It's my comfort it's my torture and yes I realize
It's just some worn out old fabric
But it's my consolation prize
And I'd be a wreck in a New York minute
If I think too long of how you held me in it
I wear your shirt like it's your arms around me
I put it on and you just surround me
It's so soft on my skin
Like the touch of your hands
So good it hurts
I should burn it I know
Tear it up I'm this close
But for the moment I just can't let go
Of your shirt

What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
'Cause everybody has already tried
Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em
So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
Aww, could you love me anyway?
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if that's what this is
I don't want to let it slip away
No, no, no
Could you love me anyway?
Please
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway? Oh
Could you love me anyway?

Well the sun came up this mornin', my ain't it a beautiful day.
Heard that highway callin', time to be on our way.
Girl I never seen the sun shine brighter, I need you to be my rainbow
Rider.
Your sweet smile can keep all the clouds at bay,
So get up, we can use a holiday.
We're gonna drive up on the mountain, clear up to the timber line.
Sleep out in the moonlight, way up their among the pines.
In a grassy meadow with the stars up above you.
I'm gonna show you how much I love you.
We're gonna leave all our worries and cares behind.
So come on rainbow rider, time to rise and shine.
We've been hangin' around this ole town too long.
Can't you hear that highway callin', the radio is playin' a traveling
Song. come on!!
We'll wake up in the mornin' have coffee at a small cafe,
Find a celebration, and listen to the guitars play.
We're gonna run in the sunshine, dance in the moonlight.
As long as you're with me everything will be just right.
I might stop to pick you a sweet bouquet.
So come on rainbow rider, let's be on our way.
Yeah, we'll go up on the mountain, all the way to the top.
We might just keep on goin' and never stop!

You've been there all the time
right in front of my eyes
but I didn't see you
And now, I shake like a leaf
now, I can't seem to speak
whenever you're near me
I'm ready for a season of love
I'm ready for a change to come
and I do believe I've been waiting my whole life alone
All just for you to come along
Now I'm here with you
and out of the blue
something new is beginning
but I, I can't explain
why just like the rain
I can't keep from falling
Oh, I'm ready for a season of love
I'm ready for a change to come
Oh, and I do believe I've been waiting my whole life alone
All just for you to come along
You've been there all the time
right in front of my eyes
but I didn't see you

An empty house
A broken fairy tale
A hollow girl with empty arms
From an angel's tears
God made the stars
Why can't he make me an unbreakable heart
In my blue world
You shone like heaven's fire
And left me cryin' in the dark
How could anyone
Be so hard
Did you think I had
An unbreakable heart
I suppose I should know
Sometimes love just comes and goes
But I believed, foolish me
We'd go on and on
One day someone will come to you
And rock you tightly in her arms
Please remember this when you drop your guard
Nobody has an unbreakable heart
From an angel's wings to a fallen star
God makes everything
But unbreakable hearts

You're my bright and shining star, I'll be with you wherever you are

I want a little sugar
In my bowl
I want a little sweetness
Down in my soul
I could stand some lovin'
Oh so bad
I feel so funny and I feel so sad
I want a little steam
On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up
So they'll go
Whats a matter Daddy
Come on, save my soul
I need some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl
You been acting different
I've been told
Soothe me
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want some steam
On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
Whats a matter Daddy
Come on save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some, yeah, in my bowl

Flyin down this hill on my schwin
Well I guess this is where it all begins
Go in sandburg come out like ray charles
An odor of jasmine for yer flowers
Sometimes on my bicycle rides
These pleasantries fall from the trees
Little Quixote's fished out like floaties
From the bevy of yer choice
Ladies choice
Flyin down this hill on my schwin
Well I guess it all could have ended then
Unlike consternation's quagmire above
The streets firmly paved ways
Coupled with speed and gravity
And the craniums tendency
To leak vital information
All over the road to recovery

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door
And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time
This is the year of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
These are the days of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
And say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back?
'Cause he has no children to come back for
And it's hard to love
When there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Parody of Any Man Of Mine by Shania Twain (S. Twain/R. Lange) Loon Echo Music (BMI)/Zomba Enterprises (ASCAP)
New lyrics by Cledus T. Judd and Cris Clark, La-Po Music (BMI)/Chris Clark Publishing Designee.
This is what Cledus T. wants...
If Shania was mine
Wouldn't be proud of me
Couldn't hardly blame her
'cause I'm so derned ugly
But on our first date
We could have a good time
If I got her on the moonshine
If Shania was mine
Say it fit just right
Though my polyester suit was just a little too tight
And there's no way
I'd have a bad hair day
'cause I'd buy a new toupee'
Oh, I'd love to seduce her
But she married her producer
Now all I do is pray, pray, pray!
She'll get a deevorce someday
If Shania was mine
I'd probably lose my mind
If she only squeezed me, teased me
Pleased me one good time
And if she only knew
All the things I'd do
I'd be the lawn mowin, crop growin
Tater peelin, house cleanin kind
If Shania was mine
Ha huh
If Shania was mine
She'd have to agree
Can't no one cook road kill better than me
Add a dozen mountain oysters and some old fatback
She'd say "Mmm, I like it like that" cha...
Now all I do is wonder
Whose bed have her boots been under
I wish she'd hadda been mine
Now I whine, whine!
That girl is so doggone fine
If Shania was mine
I think I'd go slap blind
Starin' at her yummy little tummy
And her booty shakin' round behind
And if she only knew
All the things I'd do
I'd be the lawn mowin' crop growin'
Tater peelin' house cleanin' kind
If Shania, if Shania, if Shania,
If Shania, if Shania (ACK HACK)
Now was that Mutt Lange or Deewight Yokel
When she shimmies and shakes
It's more than I can take
Oh, what she does to me in them videos
Wife's gonna leave me if I don't explain
What I see in Shania Twain
I'd love to see her in a magazine
Centerfold if you know what I mean
Oh me-a oh my-a
I wish that Shania
Would buy me a house in South Carolina
Two, four, six, eight, nine
Oh I wish that Shania was mine!
he he he huh huh
Want to be a gal of mine...

ADDICTED TO THE RAIN
BLUE SKIES GO AWAY
DON?T YOU WASTE MY TIME
?CAUSE I DON?T HAVE A PLACE FOR YOU
INSIDE THIS HEART OF MINE
YOU PROMISE BRIGHTER DAYS
BUT NEVER DO COME THROUGH
EVER SINCE SHE WENT AWAY BLUE SKIES
I?VE HAD NO USE FOR YOU
BUT WHEN I SEE THE CLOUDS COME ROLLIN? IN
AND THE HEAVENS TURNIN? GRAY
I CAN TELL I?M BACK AMONG GOOD FRIENDS
WHO KNOW JUST WHAT I CRAVE
Chorus	I ADMIT IT, I?M ADDICTED TO THE RAIN
SHE ALWAYS SAID SHE LOVED TO HEAR IT
ON THE WINDOW PANE
WHILE THE STORM OUTSIDE WAS RAGIN?
WE?D LOVE THE NIGHT AWAY
NO WONDER I?M ADDICTED TO THE RAIN
THERE?S A CALM INSIDE OF ME
WHEN I SEE LIGHTNING FLASH
AND RAIN?S SWEET PERFUME FILLS ME WITH HOPE
THAT SHE JUST MIGHT COME BACK
I CAN HEAR HER IN THE WIND
AND FEEL HER IN THE MIST
AS I WALK THESE STREETS AND WONDER
WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHERE SHE IS
BUT THE ROLLING THUNDER HELPS TO EASE
THE PAIN I FEEL INSIDE
IN THE POURING RAIN NO ONE CAN SEE
THE TEARDROPS IN MY EYES
Repeat Chorus
Tag	I REMEMBER HOW SHE?D WAKE ME
AND WE?D LOVE THE NIGHT AWAY
NO WONDER I?M ADDICTED TO THE RAIN

Every reason not to go
I don't think you'll like it
I hear that city's cold
And the people are much warmer
Two good reasons not to go
You fight traffic all day long
Then you gotta pay to park
You have to go around locking all your doors there after dark
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
Their football team is lousy
No matter what they do
You can bet come Sunday they'll find a way to lose
You'll hate the way the smoke and the buildings block the sky
Got the prices jacked so high takes a million to get by
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
There must be something in this town
You'd be missing if you move
'Cause I know if you weren't around I'd be missing you
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
I'm in love with you
And baby now you know every reason not to go

It was past her bedtime
On a stormy night
And she couldn't shut her eyes
And she couldn't blow out the light
So she gave up struggling
And let the candle burn
The hail knocked her window
As her memories knocked in turn
And her room had four blue walls
They've been hers since she was small
No sleep in sight
Oh her father
Is the only one
Who pretends he can't remember
What was done
And her mother
Can't find the strength
To do anything at all but stand and pray
In a room with four blue walls
That were closing in together
'Til they got so goddamn small
That she had to brave the weather
By herself
So she went to the barroom
And she picked a fight
He told her she was looking for trouble
And she said "that's right"
She was looking for an eardrum
So she beat him and she shoved
'Til he couldn't quite resist her when she dragged him home for love
To a room with four blue walls
On a floor that's worn like leather
And the shadows fell across them
As she held their eyes together
And they cried
Would you be my ocean
Won't you be the rain
Can a kiss from you rinse another from my brain
Can we wash these floorboards
Can we wash these walls
Can I close my eyes and sleep once and for all
In a room with four blue walls
Filled from floor to roof with water
And a man who calmly calls her "darling dear"
Not "darling daughter"
She sleeps at last
She sleeps at last
And her room had four blue walls

Out of all the hearts you've known and could have chosen
The blessings of your love surrounded me
For me the door of love had long been closing
If not for you I'd still be searching for my dreams
Thank you for loving me from the bottom of my heart
Thank you for loving me thank you sweetheart
Thank you for loving me and for being what you are
Thank you for loving me thank you sweetheart
I've memorized a million things to tell you
But words can't tell what feelings want to say
True love only beckons to a precious few
And when it moves into your heart it never strays
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me thank you sweetheart

CUP OF LONELINESS
(George Jones - Burl Stephens)
« © '59 Glad Music »
I see Christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin
Called out of darkness a new life to begin
Were you ever in the valley when the way is dark and dim
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with Him
Did you ever have them laugh at you and say it was a fake
The stand that you so boldly for the Lord did take
Did they ever mock at you and laugh in ways quite grim
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with Him
Did you ever try to preach then hold fast and pray
And even when you did it there did not seem a way
And you lost all courage then lost all your vim
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him

Momma loved us, every one
Every daughter, every son
She gave herself so happily
That's just the way she was, you see
From dawn to dark she'd find a chore
And work it 'til it was no more
And every day until she died
In the evening, momma cried
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone
Her little girl was snatched away
She was there and then just gone one day
And momma blamed herself, I'd say
But all of us had debts to pay
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone
I did my best to cheer her pride
That day that something broke inside
I swore I'd find her and I tried
In the evening, momma cried
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone

The lights of the city
Look good when you're leaving
You don't even count what you lost
The streets and their madness
Make my heart so sad
They will never be worth what they cost
Take me to the mountain
I want to see the other side
Oh give me one golden day
And I won't care where I've been
Oh let this world slip away
And I'll start all over again
I will start all over again
I'm through with the struggle
And tired of the trouble
It's high time I left it behind
I've walked the mean streets
Just counting my heartbeats
It's easy to lose your mind
I'll break the chains that bind me
For my soul is deep and wide
Oh give me one golden day
And I won't care where I've been
Oh let this world slip away
And I'll start all over again
I will start all over again
As sure as the sun keeps rising on me
I'll find a place where I ought to be
Oh give me one golden day
And I won't care where I've been
Oh let this world slip away
And I'll start all over again
I will start all over again
And I won't care where I've been
Oh let this world slip away
And I'll start all over again
I will start all over again over again

I guess there's not much I can do or say
Saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I try to tell her so
It's hello blues and down the road I go
Well I've never seen that guy before today
He held my baby in close this way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know
It's hello blues and down the road I go
Well it seemed our thoughts were much alike,
Our likes were much the same
We even had our future planned
'Til in the town he came

You came into this world, in the blink of an eye
Well man how time really flies
You made me smile, and as a tear fell from my eye
You lit the room up little guy,
It was the best day of my life
Now Ill laugh with you, cry with you
Let my love surround you
And Ill dance with you, pray for you
And wrap my arms around you when you cry
Little Guy
Cause Im gonna be the best dad that I can
Ill take you by those little hands
And when you stumble, Ill pick you right up
Ill be your number one fan
And watch you grow into a man
Now Ill laugh with you, cry with you
Let my love surround you
And Ill dance with you, pray for you
And wrap my arms around you when you cry
Little Guy
Youre gonna grow older, wiser
Youre gonna chase your dreams
And one day raise a family
And youll know just what I mean
Son you mean the world to me
Now Ill laugh with you, cry with you
Let my love surround you
And Ill dance with you, pray for you
And wrap my arms around you when you cry
Little Guy
Im so glad youre mine,
Little Guy

There is nothing that is wrong
Wanting you to stay here with me
I know you got somewhere to go
Won't you make yourself at home and never leave
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you
Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies
Love is all that matters won't you stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you
I long to see the mornin' light
Color in your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you

Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures.
We never know which way the wind will blow,
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.
But He's a solid rock when troubles grow,
And He's holding out a saving hand for me.
He'll be a refuge in the storm;
He'll be a beacon in the night;
In the chilly winds of doubt He'll keep you warm;
When you can't find your way He'll be your light

I came up through the trenches where
We only played for tips and alcohol
You find out what you're made of when there
Ain't no gold or platinum on the wall
And there's a few more like me who
Ain't of fightin' for the cause
[Chorus]
Me and my band of brothers we got you covered
Out here on the honky tonk front lines
We're loaded up with country music, we ain't afraid to use it
Even if we have to play all night
Well, we ain't no rookies; it's our third tour of duty
But that's all right
Yeah, that's all right
Me and my band of brothers got you covered
On the honky tonk front lines
From the bars of San Diego to the
County fair way up in Bangor Maine
We keep the tour bus rollin' just like it was
A big old Sherman tank
Like those who came before us
Owens, Haggard, Willie, Waylon, Jones and Hank
(And Johnny Cash)
[Chorus]

This conversation is going nowhere fast
Like a train on a dead-end track
There is nowhere left to go
Well, I don't really want to drag this out
If you're going to say it, say it now
No need to take it slow
We both know it's over
I don't need a shoulder
Oh, baby, let's just
Say good-bye and leave it at that
Instead of saying things we can't take back
The more we talk, the harder it gets to really let go
You couldn't fix it even if you tried
So go on and let me cry
You said you're leaving, leave it at that
Don't even try to let me down easy
It's pretty clear that you don't need me
Like you did before
What's so hard about the word good-bye
When I already see it in your eyes
So what are you waiting for
Only time can mend this
Why don't we just end it
Oh, baby, let's just
Say good-bye and leave it at that
Instead of saying things we can't take back
The more we talk, the harder it gets to really let go
You couldn't fix it even if you tried
So go on and let me cry
You said you're leaving, leave it at that
Let's just say good-bye and leave it at that
Instead of saying things we can't take back
The more we talk, the harder it gets to really let go
You couldn't fix it even if you tried
So go on and let me cry
You said you're leaving
You said you're leaving
Leave it at that

The sun goes down, it leaves me sad and blue
The iron curtain falls on this cold war with you
Though you won't speak and I won't speak, that's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through
Oh why, oh why should love ever come
To couples like you and me
Whose cold, cold wars are never won
And whose hearts just can't be free?
Oh, let's do right or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold cold war with you
Oh why, oh why should love?

Please break my heart
Say it's forever
Then I'll remember
How you said forever to me
Please break my heart
I'll be piece it together
I'd rather be shattered
Than to know forever
Without you
Love is all that matters
And it mattered none to you
Love is all that mattered
And you left me
Crying, sighing and blue
Please break my heart
Kiss me like never,
One kiss to remember
The rest of my life
To forget about you
All the broken hearts together,
Do they matter none to you?
I was hoping mine would matter
And you left me
Crying, sighing and blue
Please break my heart
Do it forever
Oh, please break my heart

I would be sad because you left me all alone.
I would be sad because the lies that you had told.
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adore.
I would be sad because the love I had before.
I meant what I said when I said I would settle down with you
Although I know it's not something that you were asking me to do.
And I know we are young but we won't always be, so marry me
Let's not be that predictable young couple changing, moving on.
But I can tell by watching you that theres no chance of pushing through.
The odds are so against us; you know most young love it ends like this.
I would be sad because you left me all alone.
I would be sad because the lies that you had told.
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adore.
I would be sad for all the love I had before.
I meant what I said when I said I would rearrange my plans and change for you.
You know me, I've always been the kind with easy confidence.
Confident enough to honestly believe that nothing out there stopping me
Especially not someone who's not loving me.
Now listen here I told you I could live on with out loving you.
I was bluffing then, but it seems that just might have been the truth.
Well my dad told me, "One day son, this girl will think of what she's done
And hurting you will be the first of many more regrets to come."
And he said, "If she doesn't call, then it's her fault and it's her loss."
I say, "It's not that simple see, but then again it just may be."

I do not count what I've lost, what I'm losing
I'm a traveller with no fixed abode
All of the gifts yesterday spent refusing
May well be waiting further down the road
-------
I tried to take every chance I was given
But if luck's a lady she never showed
There's more to life than just making a living
My life is waiting further down the road
-------
CHORUS:
Further down the road
I can see the light
Further down the road
Everything 'll be all right
Further down the road
I will be free
Further down the road
Heaven waits for me
-------
All of the years chasing smoke-rings and rumour
Looking for seed that had never been sown
Old Father Time has a strange sense of humour
He'll hear me laughing further down the road
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
No looking back
I'm moving on
I'm having no regrets
What's gone is gone
-------
REPEAT CHORUS TWICE:

I found a letter that you wrote me
It said I was your one and only
And you would never ever leave my loving arms
But the truth is all that matters
Your pretty words no longer flatter
'Cause I know they didn't come from your heart
I found your guitar in the closet
I remember when you bought it
And how you serenaded me under the stars
Now there's no one here to play it
You changed your tune, I hate to say it
But the songs didn't come from your heart
In your heart, I believed I'd found the love of my dreams
I hoped my search was through
But now, all I'm finding are memories that remind me
What a fool I was, to think it was true
I found your ring still on my finger
It's been there since we saw the preacher
And swore to him, in front of God, death do us part
It's just a fourteen-carat trinket
But like my promise, I will keep it
Even though it didn't come from your heart
I found a letter that you wrote me

Bobby Bare
Willie Jones was a man I met when I lived in Baltimore
I was a guard and he was doing time
In the three long years he stayed there I got to know him well
Willie Jones he was a friend of mine
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more
He talked about the whippoorwills in the Alabama night
Honeysuckle vine and sugar cane
Swimming holes and fishing poles and early morning frost
And sleeping under a tin roof when it rained
He talked about a country road and a cabin in the pines
And a girl with wavy long chestnut brown hair
He talked about the beauty of his Blue Ridge Mountain home
And darn near made me think that I was there
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
When a man ain't got no freedom the time sure passes slow
Willie Jones had ten long years to go
It's been almost a years now since that hot night in July
Willie hit the guard and jumped the fence
I had my rifle ready but I couldn't let it fly
I shot over his head and we ain't seen him since
Then last week the postman brought a letter to my door
Marked No Return Address and No Reply
It just said nobody north of Birmingham is gonna see this boy again
But if you're ever down our way won't you please drop by
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more

Stranger here
Face down in the river floating by
A backwards sky
Stranger here, hung by the neck
Jeered by the crowd
Stranger here, stranger here
And I could tell you about the time
I was looking for a rhyme
Communing with the planets above
I am the righteous man
The one you're looking for
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
Stranger here
The legend will be told about the boy
Never hungry, never cold
Stranger here, smoke in my eyes
Strange taste on my tongue
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
And I could tell you about the evening
That I was out drinking
And fell asleep by the side of the well
I am the righteous man
The one you're looking for
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
And I could tell you about the time
I was swinging from the twine
And saw you flirting with that Jack-in-the-crowd
I am the righteous man
The one you're looking for
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
Stranger here
Head on the pillow floating by
Willows sigh

Girl I caught you in your little white lie
Red handed, red handed
You said you had to work tonight
But here you are dancing
Slow dancing
In this honky talk with someone else
And all you got to say for yourself
Is "So?"
So?
Sorry, so?
[Chorus]
So so long, bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe
Don't you slip slide on a tear when you find me gone
Go go on cry cry baby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long
so so long
Let me buy you a goodbye drink
Make it a double
A double
Cause I've seen everything I need to see
You're nothing but trouble
Big trouble
And one other thing before I go
I want to tell you that I think you're so
So, so
Oh I ain't gonna sink that low
[Chorus]
I bet you think I'm gonna let it slide
The way you're flashing me those puppy dog eyes
Right? yeah right.. Right?
Wrong!
[Chorus]
See ya

Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses
Oh, how I'm missing
The things that used to be
I love you, I want you
I need you constantly
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me
Days and nights go crawling by
Where is the love that I knew?
Everything is wrong
Nothing seems right
Except this longing for you
I've cried and I've tried
What more than this poor fool do?
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me
Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses
Oh, how I'm missing
The things that used to be
I love you, I want you
I need you constantly
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me
Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses

Well Lord I love this ranchin' with it's ropin' and brandin'
But I don't like that farmin' at all
It's goodby for the summer this haying's sure a bummer
And I'll be back to help you gather in the fall
Well I don't mind riding fences but them tractors are wrenches
I ain't never liked and I guess I never will
Just give me my horse and saddle or some woolies or some cattle
And turn me loose and let me ride out through the hills
Cause I'm just a cowboy a dirt and sweat cowboy
Livin' on beef steak and beans
I ain't to hard to please but Mister you better believe
I ain't never had no use for farm machines
Well there ain't much romancing in old fashioned branding
But Lorrie it suits me just fine
Oh the dust and the smoke's enough to make a feller choke
But have you ever had to ride one of them old combines
Now my grandpa was a farmer a Michigan black land farmer
And he worked with them machines the whole day through
But I bet if he did some roaming through the hills of old Wyoming
He'd probably feel about the same way that I do
I reckon it's just bad fate I was born a hundred years too kate
And they say boy if you want to survive you'd better change
But as long as sagebrush grows and that old Powder River flows
I'll be a cowboy till my dyin' day
I'm just a cowboy...
Well I think I just heard a discouraging word
About them rattleing banging smoking farm machines

Dark clouds hangin' over me
When will they go away?
Rain is in my eyes and I can't see
Life's become just cloudy days
Why she done me like she done
I guess I'll never know
She knows I need her more than anyone
I made a point to let it show
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?
Stormy weather will you always be around?
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days
I recall a time when times were good
Lord, it seems so long ago
But you know they say if rain won't come
Then love has no chance to grow
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?
Stormy weather will you always be around?
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?
Stormy weather will you always be around?
When I'm down, I can't stand...
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?
Stormy weather will you always be around?
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days
Stormy weather will you always be around?
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days

It brings back an old feeling
Running into you like this
I'm really not afraid of hurting
But I can't stand the awkwardness
Do I laugh
Do I cry
Do I dare look in your eyes
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you
You seem to be a bit distracted
I wish that I could feel the same
You never were too good at acting
Baby some things never change
I can't keep from letting go
It's something that I can't control
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you
You stand there looking sweet and innocent
But how can you be so cruel and confident
At my expense
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at....
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' blow
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you
Oh yeah, every time I look at you

It was more like a dream than reality
I must have thought it was a dream while she was here with me
When she was near I didn't think she would leave
When she was gone it was too much to believe
So with tomorrow I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
And another dream and another with tomorrow
So if there some day won't be time just to look behind
There won't be reasons, no descriptions for my place and mind
There was so much I was told that was not real
So many things that I could not taste but I could feel
So with tomorrow I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
And another dream and another with tomorrow

Girl I swear you got me acting crazy
Half the time I don't know what my name is
I'm the kind that like to take it slow and lazy
And girl you got me running hot and haziest
[Chorus]
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never
Oh, I love you like I never loved before
Boy you got me burning like a rocket
You stole my heart and stuck it in your pocket
Now I got your face inside my locket
I've really tried but I don't think I can stop it baby
[Chorus]
You sat beside me last night on the sofa
I took your hand and pulled you a little closer
You kiss my lips and then you let me hold you
That feels the way that love supposed to baby
[Chorus]
You held the door when we went to the movies
I like your quirky sneaky sense of humor
You're strong and sweet and all the things I needed
You're the one that keeps my heart beating baby
[Chorus]
Oh, my heart stops beating
When it's time for you to leave me
Yeah, and my head starts spinning
Every time that you are near me
[Chorus: x2]

Her memory was a mountain
As tall as it was wide
It cast a cold dark shadow
Across this heart of mine
I tried to rise above it
Might have rolled a stone or two
The mountain moved
And I could see
A vision of forever standing right in front of me
The earth stood still
And the light broke through
Some miracles only love can do
The mountain moved
I say you smiling at me
I heard you speak my name
You reached out to hold me
And I let go of yesterday
It's still there in the distance
But it's fading from my view
'Cause last night for the first time
The mountain moved
And I could see
A vision of forever standing right in front of me
The earth stood still
And the light broke through
Some miracles only love can do
The mountain moved

I stopped by at the party of an old friend
But then I saw this old sweetheart I once knew
And I vowed as I set me down beside her that darling I was coming home to you
Can I help it if she was going my way
And we talked about old times we used to know
And I'm sure we had that green light at the corner
Anyone who saw the wreck could tell you so
I was only gonna drop her off at her place
And then darling I was coming home to you
Then you came you saw her lying there beside me
Please believe me dear that romance is through
Even though I know you saw her arms around me darling I was coming home to you
Believe me darling I was coming home to you

Looking out my window
See you playing in the leaves
It's amazing how a little girl
Means all the world to me
When I tell you that I love you
I love you more than words can say
Smile say cheese pretty please
I want to take your picture
How'd you ever get so big
I gotta take your picture
And hold on to the mem'ry before
The whole things slips away
I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop
The world from turning
Keep things just the way they are
I wish I could shelter you from
Everything not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't
But I wish I could
When you kiss me for no reason
It goes straight to my heart
When I feel your arms around me
I almost fall apart
It's time for bed
You whisper "daddy we forgot to pray"
I wish I could save these moments
When I watch you sleeping
All my worries slip away
A little bit of heaven
Close on your gentle face
I wish I could save these moments

She's been playin' in a room on the strip
For ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror,
And she only ages
She's been readin' 'bout Nashville on the records,
That everybody's buyin'
Says, I'm a simple girl myself, grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags
To try her hand
Says, This might be, my last chance
She's gone country,
Look at 'dem boots
She's gone country,
Back to her roots
She's gone country,
A new kinda suit
She's gone country,
Here she comes
Well the folk seems dead,
But he's holdin' out in the village
He's been writing songs,
Speakin' out against wealth and privilege
He says, I don't believe in money, but a man can make him a killin'
Cause, some of that stuff don't sound much different then Dylan
I hear down there,
It's changed you see,
They're not as backward as they used to be
He's gone country,
Look at 'dem boots
He's gone country,
Back to his roots
He's gone country,
A new kinda' suit
He's gone country,
Here he comes
He commutes to LA,
But he's gotta house in the valley
But the bills are pilin' up,
And the crop scene just ain't on the rally
He says, Honey I'm a serious compose, good in voice and composition
With the crime and the smog these days,
This ain't no place for children
Lord it sounds so easy,
It shouldn't take long
He'll be back in the money,
In no time at all
He's gone country,
Look at 'dem boots
He's gone country,
Back to his roots
He's gone country,
A new kinda' suit
He's gone country,
Here he comes
Yaah, he's gone country,
A new kind of walk
He's gone country,
A new kinda of talk
He's gone country,
Look at 'dem boots
He's gone country,
Oh, back to his roots
He's gone country,
He's gone country,
Everybody's gone country
Yeah, we've gone country
The whole world's gone country
We gone

I said a bad word when I was a kid
Mama said that I'd be sorry for the sin that I did
My daddy whooped me and the preacher said shame
And I tried like hell to change
I cuss, I smoke
I laugh at dirty jokes
Minor vices man I know 'em well
I've closed down bars
And I've busted in my heart
My exes think I oughta burn in hell
But the devil, he won't notice when I die
Don't you figure
He's got bigger fish to fry
Oh yeah
Politicians taking corporate bribes
Crooked CEOs are getting off with no time
Christmas eve burglars stealin' good children's toys
(Can't say Christmas)
Holiday burglars stealin' good children's toys
I cuss, I smoke
I laugh at dirty jokes
The minor vices, man I know I'm well
I've closed down bars
I've busted in my heart
My exes thinks that I oughta burn in hell
But the devil wont even notice when I die
Ya don't you figure
Hes got bigger fish to fry
There's gonna be a bonfire burnin'
An everlastin' barbeque
But with all the bad stuff goin' on
There ain't gonna be room for me and you
'Cause we cuss and we smoke
We laugh at Taylor's jokes
(Tell one Jim, you know you're old when your wife says
'honey lets run upstairs and make love' and your answer is I cannot do both)
Some minor vices, man we know 'em well
We've closed down bars and we've busted in our hearts
Our exes think we oughta burn in hell
But the devil, he wont notice when we die,
Don't you figure he's got bigger fish to fry
Ya don't you figure
He's got bigger fish to fry
(Pass the tarter sauce)
(When we all get to Heaven, what a day of rejoicing it will be...)

There's not a star left in the sky tonight
That hasn't been wished on
And I've been wishin' I could find me a wishin' well
I'd throw in every penny I own
I've got moonlight and a warm June night
All that's missing here is you
Me and the moon have never been so blue
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me
In a way
I can see your eyes in the stars
But it's not the same
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight
To be the stars in your eyes tonight
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight
But it's me and the moon
It seems if you believe in a dream enough
It has to come true
And mine would turn back time til the world unwinds
If I could be holding you
So if a star falls from the sky tonight
You'll know what I tried to do
Me and the moon have never been so blue
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me
In a way
I can see your eyes in the stars
But it's not the same
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight
To be stars in your eyes tonight
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight
Not me and the moon
And If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me
In a way
I can see your eyes in the stars
But it's not the same
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight
To be the stars in your eyes tonight
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight
But it's me and the moon
And me and the moon have never been so blue

McKinley hollered, McKinley squalled
Doc said, "McKinley I can't find the cause
You're bound to die, you're bound to die"
Doc told the horse, he'd throw down his rein
He said to the horse, "You gotta outrun the train
From Buffalo to Washington"
The Doc came a-running, he took off his specs
He said, "Mr McKinley better cash in your checks
You've bound to die, you're bound to die"
Look here, you rascal, you see what you've done
You shot my husband and I've got your gun
I'm carrying you back, to Washington

You come home late from work, baby
You wonder why it ain't on the table
After the day that I've had
I don't believe I'm able
You give me every little reason in the book
But there's one thing that I think you've overlooked
You say you're tired, well so am i
Baby you've got to try and
Meet halfway or we ain't gonna make it, baby
Meet halfway if you want to get it right
Meet halfway cause I ain't gonna take it, baby
Meet halfway in the middle of the night
Our love is kind of stalled, baby
But it ain't about the sex
I'd trade the roses and the negligees
If we could just connect
I go deeper when you look into my eyes
There's a place where neither one of us can hide
And it's up to us to reinvent the game
Love it when you call my name and
Meet halfway, ain't no doubt about it, baby
Meet halfway and we're halfway home
Meet halfway, got to scream and shout it, baby
Meet me halfway and I'll shake you to the bone

My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wandering fool or a heart at rest?
Tonight I heard the wild goose cry
Hanging north in the lonely sky
Tried to sleep, it wasn't no use
Cause I am a brother to the old wild goose
[Chorus:]
(Oh, my heart knows what the wild goose knows)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes)
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wandering fool or a heart at rest?
Woman was kind and true to me
She thinks she loves me, more fool she!
She's got a love that ain't no use
To love a brother of the old wild goose
The cabin is warm and the snow is deep
And I got a woman who lies asleep
She'll wake up tomorrow's dawn
And find, poor critter, that her man is gone
(Oh, my heart knows what the wild goose knows)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes)
(Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?)
(A wandering fool or a heart at rest?)
Let me fly, let me fly, let me fly away
Spring is coming and the ice will break
And I can't linger for a woman's sake
She'll see a shadow pass overhead
And she'll find a feather 'side her bed

Well, I've had all the time I need to wonder
Just how much I miss her being gone
And I'm already wishing she was close enough to hold
An' her memory's only fourteen minutes old
Some big old tears just fell from my blue eyes
And I guess they must have been there all along
There's still some coffee in her cup, and it's not even cold
An' her memory's only fourteen minutes old
Well, every passing minute makes me want her
Right back in my arms where she belongs
And I'm already missing times, when she was mine to hold
And her memory's only fifteen minutes old
Some big old tears just fell from my blue eyes
And I guess they must have been there all along
There's still some coffee in her cup, and its not even cold
An' her memory's only fifteen minutes old
Her memory's only sixteen minutes old
And the coffee in her cup's not even cold

There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein; and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains,
lose all their guilty stains;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
and there may I, though vile as he,
wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away,
wash all my sins away;
and there may, I though vile as he,
wash all my sins way.

'm soaring the sky, I can hear the birds
And man they don't lie
How you gonna catch me, When I'm this high
I'm moving on
I got the words to a brand new song
How you gonna catch me, when I'm this gone
(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have
I disconnected the phone
Told the neighbors I'll be heading home
As soon as the light hits the morn
I'm heading north
Gonna see what this heart's really worth
I guess it's time to be on my own
(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have
I sure would love to see you tonight
Maybe try to end this fight
If I don't hear you knockin on my door
Then I'll know for sure
(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all
(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have

I'm no poet and I know it
I don't use five dollar words
This might not sound like much compared to all the pretty things you've heard
But here's how I'd explain it
Since you brought it up
It won't sound like anybody else's version of love
It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
It might not be suitable for greeting cards and such
But it's a true and honest feeling
And if you feel it half as much
We could go through life together without a worry or a care
Knowin' deep down in our hearts
We've got something special there
It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel
I have always heard
You can't put love into words
It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how I feel
That's how your love makes me feel

All the good times are past and gone all the good times are past and gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do
I can still see my mama bend over that ol' washpot
And it's so doggone cold you could nearly freeze on the spot
My pa eatin' them flapjacks and yellin' for more
And the kids makin' tracks across mama's clean floor
But all them good times are past and gone now all the good times are gone
Well you could look for miles down a winding railroad track
And see train a leavin' and hear one comin' back
And with a cloud of blue up over your head
It's like something from a storybook that you once read
But all them good times are past and gone now all the good times are gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do
And go down on that river when the big boats make their run
And the cane poles grow so thick they block up the sun
Just smell that coffee boilin' in an old tin can
And that hot grease poppin' in the fryin' pan
But all them good times are past and gone now all them good times are gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do

She had trailer park charm, he carved her name in his arm
Then he slept with the waitress from the bar
Then she took a chain to his car
And broke the windows on the love they had, redneck love gone bad
He got all liquored up, tried to hot wire her truck
Next thing he knew, he was seeing stars
While her daddy knocked him all around the yard
Oh, what a night they had, redneck love gone bad
'Round and around the blue lights go
Everybody's smoking and watching the show but it's over now
There's twenty-three versions of this story
Some say her love just drove that boy insane
But to me it's plain, redneck love gone bad, oh, pick him redneck
He's going with her mother now
Every Friday night we see them cruise through town
A few months back, she ran away, with a truck driver named Jose
She's happy and he's so glad, redneck love gone bad

It was running through my mind, I was running out of time
And it was time to let you go
No more right or wrong, no more crying all night long
Even though it's lonely here alone
When the phone rings I almost wish that it was you
There's nothing left to say and nothing we can do
I can stand on my own two feet
And I know that this is best for you and me
Believe me, it's not easy, I can feel the pain
It hurts so much to leave, but not enough to stay
You've convinced me before to come back for more
Well this time I'm not turning around
I'm sure one more try is bound to end in goodbye
And I've come too far to turn back now
I know the hardest part is over and I take a breath
Now we can look forward to better days ahead
Oh, I can stand on my own two feet
And I know that this is best for you and me
Believe me, it's not easy, I can feel the pain
It hurts so much to leave, but not enough to stay

MY NAME IS MUD
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY PORTER WAGONER
My name was Stranger on the night that we met
And then it was Sweetheart and it might have been yet
But my arms grew careless like a fear that they would
Now my arms are empty my lips are so cold and my name is Mud
My name is Mud my darling is gone
She won't even see me she won't even write me she won't even call
Oh they call me a cheater and they say I'm no good
And in any man's language my name is Mud
My true love worshipped the ground where I stand
Till the learned the hard way it was just shifting sand
Oh she cried enough teardrops to start her a flood
Teardrops soak my name in the sand and my name is Mud
My name is Mud...

FORGIVE ME NOW
(George Jones)
'63 Glad Music
I lost her love and started drinking trying hard to stop from thinking
And I found that it was not the thing to do
But I can't stop my heart from throbbin' couldn't ease the pain by sudden
Forgive me now and I will always do what's right
It's my fault my heart is broken angry words that we have spoken
I'm so sorry now for I have seen the light
Humbly hope that you still love me for I swear by stars above me
Forgive me now and I will always do what's right
Now I see I was mistaken and my heart is slowly breakin'
For I know that I was wrong right from the start
Let's renew our romance dear please just give once more chance dear
Forgive me now and I will always do what's right
It's my fault my heart is broken...

It wakes me up when I am sleeping
It?s all I'm thinking, all I'm feeling
It happens every time you're near me
I'm consumed, wanting you
Your touch is all I need
I found the sweet surrender
That was missing in my life
The one love that could keep my
Passion burning in the night
Like a raging fire, you're my one desire
One desire----
You're the summer wind that warms me
You're the only air I breathe
In the shelter of your love
The afterglow fills my soul
And forever's not enough (no)
I found the sweet surrender
That was missing in my life
The one love that could keep my
Passion burning in the night
Like a raging fire, you're my one desire
One desire---
Hypnotize me, hold me, hide me
Never let me go (yeah)
I found the sweet surrender
That was missing in my life
The one love that could keep my
Passion burning in the night
Like a raging fire, you're my one desire
One desire---
One desire, one desire----oh!
Like a raging fire, all I ever need, oh

It aint as fun as in the past
Light that fireworks fuse
Then you better run real fast
These days I light em up
I don't even hear the blast
It aint as fun as in the past
I used to smoke in surgery
Then every nurse I'd see,
I'd stop and make a pass
Now they put this suit on me,
They say they've been harassed
It aint as fun as in the past
I used to sit right here
Get drunk on beer
Right here on this beach
Then I'd stumble in to St Catherines
Do mass and preach
These days people stop and stare
With faces all aghast
It aint as fun as in the past
I loved Beccy back in school
Then we got married
And the first few weeks were cool
Now her and her hot-shot lawyer
Now they own my ass
It sure aint as fun as in the past
The other day I walked into a bar
Barman looked me up and down
And served me with a frown
I said take back this plastic cup
And put it in a glass
It aint as fun as in the past
Rules are fine some of the time
But tell me what's the deal
With that hard line against moonshine
Man, are you for real?
These kids are packed in bubble wrap
They should let me teach a class
It aint as fun as in the past
I've seen too many fun police
One thing I know
They won't be patrolling heaven's streets
I'll be there soon to meet Keith Moon
And I'll raise a glass
To having fun like in the past
Hope it's as fun as in the past

Memories and drinks don't mix to well
Jukebox records don't' play those wedding bells
Looking at the world thought the bottom of a glass
All I see is a man who's fading fast
Tonight I'll need that woman again
What I'd give for my baby to just walk in
To sit down beside me and say it's alright
And take me home and make sweet love to me tonight
But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sittin' with all my friends and talking to myself
I look like I'm having a good time
But any fool can tell that this honky-tonk heaven
Really makes you feel like hell
I light a lonely woman's cigarette
And we start talkin' about what we want to forget
It seems her life story and mine are the same
Both lost someone and only have ourselves to blame
But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sittin' with all my friends and talking to myself
I look like I'm having a good time
But any fool can tell that this honky-tonk heaven
Really makes you feel like hell
But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sittin' with all my friends and talking to myself
I look like I'm having a good time
But any fool can tell that this honky-tonk heaven
Really makes you feel like hell

For sale and a number on a sign at the end of the drive.
Plastic toys and a swingset all tangled up in grass that's grown knee high.
I walked up on the front porch of the house where our love made its last stand.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
I stood there on the welcome mat and discovered they forgot to lock the door.
I was glad that it was open, cause my old key don't fit here anymore.
On the wall of the living room I saw markings and a crayon drawn stick man.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
How can you put a price on someone's piece of life I'd like to know.
Something so precious can't be bought or sold. Like that corner of
the bedroom where we made love and plans.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
How can you put a price on someone's piece of life I'd like to know.
Something so precious can't be bought or sold. Like that corner of
the bedroom where we made love and plans.
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.

Your perfume is on the pillow
But I can't bring myself to change that pillow case
Some of your clothes are in the closet
But I can't bring myself to throw them away
And you stare at me from across the room
I remember when I took that picture
My favorite one of you
CHORUS
To tell the truth
I like lyin' to myself
It keeps you with me
There will never be anyone else
Although you're everywhere I look
I know you're really gone
To tell the truth, without you
I like lyin' to myself
All of our friends ask about you
And I tell them that we're doin' fine
In my heart, we're still together
But I'm in love's prison, doin' time
I just can't admit to losing you
So I
To stop this pain I can't go through
CHORUS

Well I left home at a crack of dawn just about a year ago
I thumbed my way cross the USA and I learned a lot I didn't know
The Promised Land that I thought I'd find was always just ahead of me
Until one day when I realized I left it back in Tennessee
And that's why I'm going back to my Tennessee girl and a Tennessee way of life
And I'm gonna ask my Tennessee girl to be my Tennessee wife
Tonight I slept in a hobo camp workin' out like dog by day
I never got enough to get ahead just enough to make my way
Cold and tired when the evening come all I had to ease my mind
Was thinkin' bout the place I started from and the girl that I left behind
And that's why I'm going back...
There ain't no place that I been at all that I would gonna settle in
And every town that I travel through made me want to go home again
The green green grass and the rollin' hills seem to keep a callin' me
Back to the place where I was born and the girl that I long to see
And that's why I'm going back...

I remember sayin' I don't care either way
Just as long as he or she is healthy I'm okay
Then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
And said "Ya see that thing right there, well you know what that means"
And I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me
He'll probably climb a tree to tall and ride his bike too fast
End up every summer wearin' something in a cast
He's gonna throw a ball and break some glass, in a window down the street
He's gonna get in trouble, he's gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback, if he's anything like me
I can see him right now, knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass tryin' to melt a Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on
That'll be his first love til his first love comes along
He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me
He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grass
He's gonna get caught skippin' class and be grounded for a week
He's gonna get in trouble, we're gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback, if he's anything like me

Holding things together ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raising children it's a job meant for two
Alice please believe me I can't go on and on holding things together with you gone
Today was Angie's birthday I guess it slipped your mind
I tried twice to call you with no answer either time
But the postman brought a present I mailed some days ago
I just signed it love from mama so Angie wouldn't know
Holding things together...
[Steel - Piano]
Holding things together...
I'm holding things together please come home

I was so careless, I left you all alone
When I was running in the streets and carrying on
You were so patient, you never said a word
You tried to hide all your tears and bury the hurt
I was such a fool, I didn't figure it out
Till I came home last night to an empty house
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
When someone you need so desperately is gone
I didn't know how bad the hurt could be
It took you walking out to make me see
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
It's only midnight but baby with you gone
It's forever since sundown and forever till dawn
And as I lie here looking at myself
It's hitting me hard how you must have felt
I'm sorry, I hurt you and I'm sorry, you cried
And I'd give anything if I could hold you tonight
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
When someone you need so desperately is gone
I didn't know how bad the hurt could be
It took you walking out to make me see
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone

It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away don't I matter anymore
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

He sat there in his chair
Her arms around him tight.
You can't blame the lady
The lady she is blind
She said it's wrong to kill this man
Even if he's killed your child
Revenge is mine, said the Lord
Well the Lord's one lucky guy
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall
Pray for the innocent
Justice for all
An eye for an eye
Would leave the whole world blind
Forgiveness is the way
But I can't forgive his crime
And if I had the chance
In truth I'd have to say
I'd gun that bastard down
With a smile on my face
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall
Pray for the innocent
Justice for all
Don't do as I do
A wiser man would say
But on a journey of revenge
Be sure to dig two graves
And when they throw us in 'em
I hope the lady finally sees
Bears witness to the wrong and right
And knows which one I'll be
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall
Pray for the innocent
Justice for all
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall

Got to go out of town but I'll be back soon
Don't burn down this old barroom
Everyone in here's like family
Till I get back do this for me
Please feed the jukebox while I'm gone
Take good care of these old songs
The only place I know of
That's got that music that I love
Keep the beer cooler stocked
Put the cold ones up on top
Until I get myself back home
Please feed the jukebox while I'm gone
I'm sure gonna miss the Longhorn Lounge
Five o'clock rolls around
Tip the waitress good, my friends
Give old Ernest Tubb a spin
Please feed the jukebox while I'm gone
Take good care of these old songs
It's the only place I know of
That's got that music that I love
Keep the beer cooler stocked
Put me a cold one up on top
Until I find my way back home
Please feed the jukebox while I'm gone
Until I find my way back home
Please feed the jukebox while I'm gone

Girl, I know you dont really know me
Still I want you to listen closely, this might sound crazy
But after all, isnt love like that, I would be crazy
To let this moment pass
What if I don't say what's on my mind and you walk away
I might live out my life and never feel this way
What if you are the one that I'm meant to love, what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
And girl, take a chance, time is unfolding
We could be blessed without even knowing, just for a minute
Close your eyes and dont take another breath
Cause what if you miss it and it never comes again
And what if you dont say whats on your minds and I walk away
You might live out your lives and never feel this way
What if I'm the one that you're meant to love and what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
I dont wanna wake up by myself
Years from now wishin that Id told you what I felt
Your eyes are a window to your soul
If you dont open up, I may never know
What if we dont say whats on our minds and we walk away
We might live out our lives and never feel this way
What if I am the one and you are the one, what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
Oh girl, what if you are the one and I am the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice

I looked around and all up and down
I never wasted time on two or three
There's only one girl for me
There was a time she used to treat me fine
But lately she's been acting awful stoned
Makes a man weep alone
[Chorus]
Eye dee oh lay ee tee
Eye dee leeldle odle ay oo ee tee
Eye dee oh lee tee
Lee tee
Deedle ohdle lee tee
My morphine be the death of me
You should have seen me and my morphine
When we used to go dancing in the war
Spin me right off the floor
[Chorus]
Morphine, morphine, what made you so mean?
You never used to do me like you do
Where's that sweet gal I knew?
[Chorus]
My morphine

She remembers the nights he'd come calling
His yellow silk tie
In love she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever changed
She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever changed
Some days she'll talk about Aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when she's coming over
And why she hasn't called
Some days I just hold her fragile hand
As Tom creeps across the floor
Some days it almost kills me
Watching her memories slip away a little more
Forever changed,
Forever changed,
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named,
Forever child,
Forever loved,
Forever changed.

Pancho Villa Pancho Villa the robinhood of Mexico
Pancho Villa Pancho Villa the robinhood of old Mexico
He rode into town one evening the streets began too clear
The word was passed in whisper the bandit Pancho Villa's here
With his band of mighty outlaws many stories had been told
Did he fight for the rights of us or was it lust for gold
His rifles numbered forty his men gave a mighty shout
And the soldiers that we hated were all dead or criminal
And when the battle ended our town was in his hands
We realized that with men free bout Pancho Villa's outlaw band
Pancho Villa Pancho Villa...
Then I looked out my window and I began to pray
As he smiled at my Rosana across the street as she came my way
I knew my hand was trembling as I prepared to draw
And in my eyes could not believe the miracle I saw
He put down gold and silver and food for us to eat
Said I didn't come to harm you and our hearts fell at his feet
He told us to build a mission so grand and so strong so gay
So the people that he love would know Pancho Villa passed this way
Pancho Villa Pancho Villa...

Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But I'm going to get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
And I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's not take too long
You're as soft as glass and I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon
Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
Nothing is too much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep's the getting there
To live is to fly low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think too much
On the things you leave behind
I may be gone but I won't be long
I'll be bringing back the melody
And the rhythm that I find
We all got holes to fill
And them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
But choice is yours to make
Time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
To live is to fly low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
The sleep out of your eyes

I'm still learning how to pray
Trying hard not to stray
Try to see things your way
I'm still learning how to pray
I'm still learning how to trust
It's so hard to open up
And I'd do anything for us
I'm still learning how to trust
I'm still learning how to bend
How to let you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend
I'm just trying to understand
It's all in someone else's hands
There's always been a bigger plan
But I don't need to understand
I'm still learning how to bend
How to let you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home
I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head
Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues

Again,
At the end of the rainbow
Again,
No gold to be found
Just this cold unmade bed
The last 3 words you said
And this buzzing on the telephone line
Paris, well, there is fog on the Seine
Amsterdam still courses through my veins
All these dark crazy sights,
Wouldn't be so bad
If I could just taste your breath once again
Honey I saw your daddy
Lying by the roadside
His feet sticking out of a sack
Honey they'll be calling
To tell you that your daddy
Never will be coming back
Again
At the end of the rainbow
Again,
No words to be found
Just this voice sad and alone
Me wishing I was home
And the silence on the telephone line

Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee
Oh, a long long time ago when I left my home to roam
Down in the hills of Tennessee
Was the sweetest little girl that was ever in this world
Down in the hills of Tennessee
Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee
Oh, she begged me not to go, ?You'll be sorry, dear, I know?
For the way that you've were treating me
So I rambled all around and nothing could be found
To take the place of her in Tennessee
Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee
Oh, someday I'll wander back to that little cabin shack
Little girl that's waiting there for me
I can see her smiling face waiting for me at the gate
Oh, the little girl of mine in Tennessee
Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

My hand, my hand
I am the man Thomas, I am the man
Look at these nail scars I carry in my hand
I am the man Thomas, I am the man
Look at these nail scars I carry in my hand
They drove me up the hill Thomas, I am the man
They made me carry the cross Thomas, I am the man
I am the man Thomas, I am the man
Look at these nail scars I carry in my hand
They crown my head with thorns Thomas, I am the man
They nail me to the cross Thomas, I am the man
I am the man Thomas, I am the man
Look at these nail scars I carry in my hand
They pierce me in the sad(?) Thomas, I am the man
On the cross I died Thomas, I am the man
I am the man Thomas, I am the man
Look at these nail scars I carry in my hand

Don't ever kiss no one but me
If you do, dear, you'll break my heart
It's not because I doubt you
But I'm such a fool about you
I've got a jealous loving heart
Cause where there's love there's jealousy
Good and bad just won't tear apart
They always go together
Like fair and stormy weather
I've got a jealous loving heart
[ guitar ]
You're all I want you're all I love
Please don't tear my soul apart
Just say you love me too, dear
And be careful what you do dear
I've got a jealous loving heart
Don't ever kiss no one but me...

Lisa used to love to dance
Ever since she was ten years old
Her bare feet raising dust on a yard
Where the grass wouldn't grow
Slowly spinning round and round
To the music playing in her head
Late at night it could almost drown out
The whiskey on her old man's breath
The wrecking yards and dingy bars
And abandoned factories
But down among the jagged souls
A ballerina sways unseen
Hard edges hide a tender heart
Silent as a midnight prayer
Hard edges hide the sweetest part
Till you'd never know it's there
Lisa's in a club downtown
Where the neon burns till dawn
She calls herself Tina now
But she dances to the same old songs
Slowly spinning round and round
In the smoke and the smell of rye
She takes off all her clothes
So they don't see down in her eyes
The scarlet rouge and blue tattoos
Are only painted on
But underneath the dark drumbeat
A ballerina dances on
Hard edges hide a tender heart
Silent as a midnight prayer
Hard edges hide the sweetest part
Till you never know it's there

Now when I was young my
Momma read me nursery rhymes beside my bed
Though they sounded mighty fine they made no sense to me
Now that I am all grown up it seems my nights have changed such
So I went out and made me up a nursery rhyme for me
[Chorus]
It goes bar light bar bright
First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may wish I might
Find someone to hold me tight
Hey diddle diddle a man with a fiddle and the
Girls sings along with the tune
Just a one more dance til you turn off the lights and
You can shut down this saloon
Well I never understood
How a big ole gal could raise no kids in a shoe
And any old jack that goes jumping a candle
Needs to find something better to do
Rub a dub dub 3 men in a tub sure sounds kinda funny to me
So I made up a honky tonk nursery rhyme
And it's the only one I'll sing
[Chorus]

OLE SLEW FOOT
(Howard Hausey - Eddie Manney)
'59 Cave Music
High on the mountain what do you see
Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifles boys before it's too late
The bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Doin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
He never been caught and he ain't never been treed some folks say looks a lot like me
I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
They started makin' honey way up in the trees
I chopped down the tree but my honey's all gone
Ole Slew Foot's done made himself at home
He's big around the middle...
Winter's comin' on and it's twenty below the river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chase him in the gully and we'll run him in the well
And shoot him at the bottom and we'll listen to him yell
He's big around the middle...

When I was but a youngster Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
I learned a whole lot different when mother set me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way
C is for the Christ Child born upon this day
H is for Herald Angels in the night
R means our redeemer I means Israel
S is for the star that shone so bright
T is for three wise men they who travelled far
M is for the manger where he lay
A's for all he stands for S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
And that's why there's a Christmas Day

(Dolly Parton)
Last night you called me Barbara
As you lay fast asleep
And although I'm not Barbara
You wanted me to be
You whispered words I haven't heard
In such a long, long time
Last night you said I love you
With Barbara on your mind
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin
And strands of chestnut hair
That say you've been with her again
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
Last night you called me darlin'
With Barbara on your mind
With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until day light

Pour me another Tequila Sheila,
Take off that red satin dress
I cross the border and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez.
I feel like old Pancho Villa, Sheila
And sure could use a friend (I got Pesso to spend)
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again.
Though I can tell you about it
But don't mind my gun by the bed
I feel kind of naked without it
And it eases the fear in my head.
Just pass me the salt n'the lemon
Bend down n'blow out the light
I never had trusted the woman
But Sheila I'll trust you tonight.
Pour me another Tequila Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
I cross the border and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez.
I feel like old Pancho Villa, Sheila
And sure could use a friend (I got Pesso to spend)
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila,
And lay down n'love me again
Sheila I'm hearing your heart beat
But I'm hearing footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawling with damn federalists
And Sheila there's no place to hide.
I don't know who could have tipped them
nobody knew but you
But I can't make love to a squealer, Sheila
So I guess there's just one thing to do.
Pour me another Tequila Sheila.
I'm gonna put on your red dress, you put on my cloths
You go out and face the dealer
And Sheila, I wish you the best.
I feel like old Pancho Villa, Sheila
I need a fast horse and a friend
So pour me another Tequila Sheila
And I'll ride towards the border again

'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
And to take him at his word;
Just to rest upon his promise,
And to know, "Thus saith the Lord."
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust him more!
I'm so glad I learned to trust thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
And I know that thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust him more!

She came on to him like a slow moving cold front
His beer was warmer that the look in her eye
She sat on the stool, and she said "What do you want
She said Give me a love that don't freeze up inside
He said, I have melted some hearts in my time dear
But to sit next to you Lord I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, well I don't think I'd be here
Askin' myself if I had what it takes
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
These days we all play cool calm and collected
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze
But under the frost, wee thought he detected
A warm blush of red, and the touch of her knee
He said you're a beauty like I've never witnessed
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air
I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
To melt your icy blue heart

I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute
Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard
If I thought it'd do me any good at all
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays
Just to prove my love for you
I remember well the first time that I kissed you
Cause the things ain't been the same ever since
You got me thinkin' I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire fence
Now there ain't a livin' creature gonna ever come between us
I'd fight lions snakes and gorillas too
And if that ain't enough
We'll start all over just to prove my love for you
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane
Climb Mount Everest on a string
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin' barrel
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
If you just say the word I'll catch
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you
I remember well the first time
I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute

They had meant for me one last time to see my hometown again
Once again go there see the places where as a child I've been
As I journeyed now it was so far out it was almost in
In the middle in the middle of nowhere
Sadness talked with me as I walked the streets of my memory
Streets that seemed somehow so much smaller now than they used to be
Talked of other days when this tiny place had been home to me
In the middle in the middle of nowhere
People stared at me in silence as I walked around
Time had passed till I was just a stranger there
Folks had changed so much that no one even knew me now
In the middle in the middle of nowhere
I went once again to the schoolyard where I used to play
Passed the church of mom and daddy where they used to pray
Down the dusty road to the churchyard where they both now lay
In the middle in the middle of nowhere
As I placed my blue forgetmenots there on the ground
One last time I knelt by mom and dad in prayer
Then I said goodbye forever to that little town in the middle in the middle of nowhere

Holy Mary
Draw through my heart
the sweetest arrow
of thy grace
Lift my sorrows
deepening shadow
so that I may
see Your face
I know I will
not be forsaken
Gently held in
Your embrace
Blessed Spirit
whispering softly
Cool the fires
of my shame
Even as I
run from your arms
My soul keeps calling
out Your name
You were always
right here inside each
tear of joy
every drop of rain.

I'm through playin' it safe
It's time I laid it on the line
I want to dance out on the edges
And get a little reckless in my mind
Cause even a heart that's locked away
Can find a way to break
I won't hide it now
I'm through makin' that mistake
One fall, that's all
I don't know who it's gonna be
Out there, somewhere
Someone is waitin' just for me
No pain, no gain
There's not a chance that I won't take
Cause love is always worth the ache
Love's like a Vegas wheel
You've got to spin to win the prize
(you know you got to, you know you got to,
you know you got to spin to win the prize)
But it's a gamble worth the takin'
You say a prayer and then you roll the dice
(you say a prayer and, you say a prayer
and, you say a prayer and, and you roll the dice)
Well they say it's hard to beat the odds
I say it's harder not to try
I will play the game
Do what it takes to get it right
One fall, that's all
I don't know who it's gonna be
Out there, somewhere
Someone is waiting just for me
No pain, no gain
There's not a chance that I won't take
Cause love is always worth the ache
Well they say it's better to have loved and lost
Then to have never loved at all
Ah yeah yeah yeah
One fall, that's all
I don't know who it's gonna be
Out there, somewhere
Someone is waiting just for me
No pain, no gain
There's not a chance that I won't take
Cause love is always worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Yeah it's always worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Oh love is worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Yeah love is always worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Yeah
Cause love is always worth the ache

Well, I turned right on first, left on white oak
Back to my old neighborhood
I saw old Doc Randolph
He was mowing his yard
He's kept it up the best he could
And Evelyn his wife of thirty-two years
She smiled as I drove by
And she waved from her front porch screen
And she went back to reading her two dollar novel
And playing with her wedding ring
A few houses needed painting
A few gates were unhinged
But generally the place looked the same
The driveways were full of bikes and Buick sedans
Things any good American would claim
And all them other lovers
That married for cover
They were out for the sacred nightly stroll
They were wishing they were characters in two dollar novels
Wishing for their weight in gold
Now Mary Elizabeth
She's my high school sweetheart
She married my best high school friend
He manages the hardware store
She became a nurse
And I became a memory to them
And all my other buddies
They just got lost in outer space
And they ran off and served their country well
They're all fighting in a war of two dollar novels
Where only the toughest live to tell
So I turned right on white oak, left on first
Out of that old neighborhood
I left Doctor and Mrs. Randolph
Sipping iced tea on their sun porch
Wondering if I'd ever come to any good
And on a thousand shady streets
And in a thousand other towns
Now people, Lord, they're doing just the same
They're all living their lives in two dollar novels
And wondering why the the world is so insane
They're all living their lives in two dollar novels
And wondering why there's nothing left to gain

I begged her to stay I said give me one more try
But she said it's over then she said goodbye
Now I'm at this bar trying to wash away the pain
But every time I hear the jukebox the tears fall like rain
They ought to put warning labels on those sad country songs
Harmful and to your heart, when your left all alone
And if you're drinking you'll start thinking of the love that went wrong
They ought to put warning labels on those sad country songs
They warned me about cigarettes, whiskey and beer
No one ever warned me about the music I hear
I don't guess I wouldn't listen to what they said anyway
But at least I've been ready when the first sad song plays
They ought to put warning labels on those sad country songs
Harmful and to your heart, when your left all alone
And if you're drinking you'll start thinking of the love that went wrong
They ought to put warning labels on those sad country songs
There's nothing harder on my heart then old Haggard and Jones
They ought to put warning labels on those sad country songs

When you're sittin' with your honey just as cozy as can be
And you ask her can I kiss you once or twice
If she doesn't make you kiss but she quickly answers yes
That do make it nice
When you take her to a party and the fellows buzz her down
But she holds 'em off and treats some cold as ice
Then she gets you all alone whispers honey take me home
That do make it nice
When you say goodnight and you hold her tight
While you're standing at her front door
When you want to stay and she says okay
She let's you stay a couple of kisses more man you're livin'
If she doesn't care for diamonds or a lotta fancy things
'Cause she understands you haven't got the price
And just being by your side keeps her more than satisfied
That do make it nice
On the night you meet her parents and her daddy shakes your hand
And her mother looks you over once or twice
Dawn and evening's just begun if they start to call you son
That do make it nice
When you wanna pop the question but you're feelin' kinda shy
'Cause you wonder if she'll go for shoes or rice
While you're planning everything she goes out and buys the ring
Ha ha ha ha that do make it nice

Sitting in the barroom, ordering another beer
She stepped up on the stage, but nobody wanted to hear
And every word she sang was sweet music to my ears
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
It don't matter if the world don't listen
Don't you pay no heed
Elise, Elise, come and sing your song with me
I sat there at the bar, she sang the blues all night
Singing straight from the heart, living every line
I wanna tell you, girl, you touched this heart of mine
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
End of the night, well, they turned the lights down low
While the band packed up, she was standing there ready to go
I walked up and said, "Hey, I just want to let you know"
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
It don't matter if the world don't listen
Don't you pay no heed
Elise, Elise, come and sing your song with me
Elise, Elise, come and sing your song with me

You come home uncompleted
Down and defeated
Feeling all alone
You think your dreams are passing by you
And deep down inside you
You're running out of hope
c
If you could only see what I see
You'd see the man that you wished you could be
If you could only see what I see
You're my strength
The light that guides me
The angel beside me
The path that I walk
When I wake up
You're why I want to
The one I hold on to
When I start to fall
[Chorus]
Wish I could make you believe
In all that you are you don't have to be
Everything to everyone
Everybody's number one
Cause baby you're everything to me
[Chorus]

MY DADDY IS ONLY A PICTURE
Writer Tommy Dilbeck
I asked a little boy to call his daddy He said he couldn't and sighed And when I asked him what was wrong Here's what the little boy replied. My Daddy is only a picture, In a frame that hangs on the wall Each day I talk to my daddy, But he never talks at all. I tell him all of my secrets And all of my little plans And from the way he smiles at me, I know he understands. The angels took Daddy to heaven, When I was just goin' on three But I'll bet they never told him How blue and lonesome we'd be. I try to cheer up my mommie, When the tears roll down her face My daddy is only a picture, But I'm tryin' to take his place.

I know I'm right.

With the length of her mind she darked the sun

With the length of her mind she darked the sun

It was there that I met her on my way to some crisis
in need of diffusing on some old dirty turnpike
Sayin' hitchhiking is stupid
What's your name?
she said, Bridget, oh yeah
So, where's the revolution?
She had El Che on her t-shirt
Sure, I'll talk Bay of Pigs
Give me a hot beer with an aspirin
So I did
What a windbag
I just don't like rolling alone
Chorus
Bridget wants to go down Corpus
Cast a registered vote in her county
Hit the gas so she can make a difference
I bid adios to my camouflaged rider
She said thanks for the lift you old geezer
Said Bridget Bridget yeah

A naked prey sing-a-long
I could feel her cold stare
Honey, I spy a rest stop
Here's a 10
You'll need a reason to live tonight
CHORUS
(out)

I know this feeling from somewhere, I know I've been here before.
The one I love forever doesnâ??t love me anymore.
So here I am heartache.
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.
I was lookin' for true love but I didn't get far before
I tied all my heartstrings to some falling star.
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.
Between the winning and losing there's a very fine line.
This time I felt like a winner, when I was losin' all the time.
I get this rainy day feeling that I'm gonna be blue.
I thought the day I found her I'd seen the last of you.
But here I am heartache.
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.

My baby dreams while he's awake
He slips down city streets
His soles are worn so that he skates
While he's walking
My baby laughs while he's asleep
Too hot to worry
He kicks the covers with his feet
While he's laughing
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
My baby's eyes are open
But he can't see what I'm showing him
Not turquoise like a swimming pool
But calm and gray like morning
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
The right side
My baby, baby's man enough
To reach and touch a heart that's beating
Violet falls across the land
The sun's gone down it's evening
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
The right side
The right side
The right side

Billy is a shade-tree mechanic
He'd never think to charge his friends
What he don't know about a car or truck
You could put on the head of a pin
Ruby is his one and only
They've been married since she turned 18
Bein' Billy's wife and the mother of his kids
Is all she's ever wanted to be
Love to burn...more than enough
To set their world on fire and make it turn
No matter how they try they'll never use it up
They've got love to burn
Billy bought an old airstream trailer
Hitched it to their pick-up truck
An' said "Come on Ruby let's go somewhere
Now that the kids have grown up"
No we don't need a whole lotta money
But if there's one thing that we've learned
Gonna take all the time we've got left together
We've got love to burn
Now, we don't need a whole lotta money
But if there's ont thing that we've learned
Gonna take all the time we've got left together
We've got love to burn

Oh I went down to missing persons told Captain bout you
I told him just what you look like and asked him if anybody help me find you
I told him bout the time you've cheated and how your conscience bothered you
You saw me cryin' and played in sorrow didn't know I've forgiven you
Well all of the people stand then round me seem so blue
The Captain he told me that they were looking for a missing person too
Before he handled my shoulder and said we'll see what we can do
For in the world of missing persons I know your baby is sad as you
[ guitar ]
I cried oh Captain if you can't find her I don't know what I'll do
He looked at me and said we'll try sir to bring your baby back to you
And now I am walking all my shoes out searching each tree an avenue
And until I find you baby I'll be a missing person too
And until I find you baby I'll be a missing person too

Have our hearts ache with grieve as we say goodbye we shall meet someday
Where no sorrow or tears ever dim the eyes we shall meet someday
We shall meet where no storm clouds gather we shall meet someday
By the river of life sparkling cool and clear we shall meet someday
[ guitar ]
When we all cross the stream with its rolling tide we shall meet someday
In this city of rest on the other side we shall meet someday
We shall meet...

I sat bored at my piano
When he walked into the bar
When he nodded from his table
I said I know just how things are
Cause the only time I see you
Is when you've made your lady cry
And you always say you'll only stay
Till all her tears are dry
Now for months I've watched you wrestle
With that other side of you
You're scared one day you'll lose your temper
Yes and then you'll lose her too
Oh they say that love is brutal
And for years she's paid the price
It might be too late you best not wait
Till all her tears are dry
[Chorus]
You better run to her and fall on your knees
Swear that you'll be the man
She's wanted you to be
Then by the grace of God
She'll let you lay there by her side
And hold her gently
Till all her tears are dry
[Chorus]

I had a headache when I woke up this morning
And a picture of you beside my head
And I drank 'till two
And I fell lying on the floor
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war
And I can't figure out
Just what went wrong
I play it in my head
Like an old Hank Williams song
And I can't do this
I can't do this anymore
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war
Oh, and it tears me up
Knowing she's with you
Oh, and I drink some more
For your memory I gotta lose
I had a headache when I woke up this morning
And a picture of you beside my head
Oh, and I drank 'till two
And I just fell lying on the floor
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war
Yeah, yeah
The whiskey won the battle
But your memory won the war

We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz

She was a flower for the takin'
Her beauty cut just like a knife
And he was a banker from Macon
Swore he'd love her all his life
Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land
But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man
Every time he'd talk about her,
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say,
I would walk through Hell on Sunday,
To keep my rose in paradise
He hired a man to tend the garden,
To keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone
Now the banker is an old man
And the mansion's crum-ble-ing down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found
Every time he talks about her
You can see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, "I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my rose in paradise
Now there's a rose out in the garden
Its beauty cuts just like a knife
They say that it even grows in the winter time
And blooms in the dead of the night

West Texas forecast more of the same
Sunny and mild with no chance of rain
That old John Deere tractor ain't moved in days
Oh but he's out there climbin' back on
'Cause he's yet to admit that his crops are all gone
She stares out the window fightin' back tears
And watches him wastin' his time in the fields
They're havin' problems payin' the bills
And she knows that it won't be long
Before the bank finally places a lien on the farm
And the tractor keeps rolling
The dust rises high
Creating the only cloud in the sky
He's holding his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust
Yesterday somethin' in town caught his eye
The old hardware store had a help wanted sign
He thought about stoppin' but he drove on by
'Cause he just can't bear to let go
After all it's the only life he's ever known

In a pickup truck we bought in 1962
And paid each month till it belonged to me and you
The cardboard boxes in the back hold everything we own
Things we've saved for sixteen years to start a brand new home
We're holding sixteen years of love in cardboard boxes
Sixteen years of laughter sweat and tears
We've stacked the back with happiness sadness love and cheer
Things we've saved together sixteen years
We sold our little dreamhouse on a small six acre farm
And said goodbye to friends we'll miss and fields of golden corn
In our search for city life where pay is big and jobs are fine
Sixteen years of love and tears following behind
We're holding sixteen years of love...

I never had time to wonder if you were happy or sad
I never had the time to ask you what kind of day you had
For I was too busy to notice that we were drifting apart
Never had time to see just what you meant to me
And now I've got nothing but time
I never had time to tell you, it was nice just having you near
I never had the time to look for some small way to say that I care
The time just flew and I didn't see that I was breaking your heart
Never had time to see just what you meant to me
And now I've got nothing but time

They came from near, they came from far
Following a distance star to where He lay
Not being sure of what it mean, but
Knowing it was their way
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
The angels knew what was to come
The reason God had sent His son
From up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see and
Knowing of His destiny
Came tears of love
I've often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized
That star so bright
Was sent to tell all the land
The Son of God would soon become
The Son of Man
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
And the angels cried
And the angels cried

I'm calling to tell you it's over yes darling you're now free to go
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me but you can hurt me no more I know
You're asking me where this call comes from oh I hope that you won't interfere
If your new romance turns out a failure here's where to find me my dear
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops on a barstool not doing so well
The floor's got a carpet of sorrow but no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror with only the ghost of a smile
The hands of the clock never alter for things never change in the place
There's no present no past and no future we're the ones who have lost in love's race
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome...

You
You
Came into my life
It was sunshine everywhere
You were outta sight
Just standing, shining there
Shining there
Shining there
All my days were bright
You took me to the sky
You showed me the light
You taught me how to fly to the clouds
Straight up to heaven'
Was it just a dream
I couldn't tell if you were really real
Was it just a dream
A dream that I could see and touch and feel
All through the night
I held you close to me and loved you so
But with the light
You turned to me and said you had to go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Across the country side
I chased an angel fleeting
Until it dropped and sighed
It's angel wings still beating
It was you
It was you
Oh I stood there and cried
And watched love fade away
I saw an angel die
My heart died too that day

Every December sky must lose its faith in leaves
And dream of the spring inside the trees
How heavy the empty heart
How light the heart that's full
Sometimes, I have to trust what I can't know
Sometimes, I have to trust what I can't know
We walk into paradise
The angels lend us shoes
'Cause all that we own
We'll come to lose
And heaven is not so far
Outside this womb of words
With every rose that blooms
My soul is assured
It's just like a song I've known
Yet still unheard
And every leaf of fire lets go
Melting in the arms of earth and snow
And if I could hold you now
You'd enter like a sigh
You'd be the wind that blows
The answer to 'Why?'
You'd be the spring-filled trees
Of every December sky

In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia there's a girl who is waitin' just for me
Many times we walked in the moonlight and in her loving arms I long to be
I miss her smile in the moonlight and I know she misses me too
In the Shenandoah Valley of Virgiania I know that her love is still true
[ fiddle - steel ]
In the Shenandoah Valley...

"Hey y'all,
Watch this!"
Daddy's belt
Mama's drapes
Standing tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my Superman cape
I told the neighborhood girls,
said "Hey y'all, watch this!"
My fate was a broken arm
My reward, one big kiss
When Daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it
Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Oh yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!
Blacktop road
Learner permit
Though I was Earnhardt
Drvin' fast
But I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox
Then a fence, then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmers daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it!
Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Oh yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!
Just throw caution to the wind my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin!
'Cause scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Yeah, life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!
Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Pain hurts
But only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it,
Hey, the chicks dig it!
Oh yeah
The chicks dig it
The chicks dig it
Oh hey, oh yeah
The chicks dig it!
"I got this scar when I was three years old showin' off for the girl next door on my tricycle. And the one over my eye, well i got that back in '82 jumpin' off the train trestle bridge. But I got the girl...uh The chicks dig it."

One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand
Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
Once upon a mountain top, a castle stood
Carved out of rock and stone, iron and wood
Then one day a grain of sand
Grew into an iron latch
Undermined the mountain side
And the castle tumbled down
One, one, one grain of sand
A lover spoke an angry word that led to tears
The tears led to a quarrel, love disappeared
That word was like a grain of sand
That undermined the things they've planned
It shook up the house of love
And brought it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand

Been workin' like a dawg slavin' on the fence line stretchin' those wires tight
Diggin' and tappin' and sweatin' in the sunshine but I get off tonight
I got a date with a girl a perdy ranchers daughter green as her golden hair
Gonna pick her up at eight after some soap and water
And we're headin' to the county fair
Well there's a full moon in the western sky and there's magic in the air
Ain't nothin' I know of can make you fall in love like a night at the county fair
[ guitar ]
Well we walked through the midway the lights and the laughter
She puts her little hand in mine
Well she don't act like she knows what I'm after
But tonight I'm gonna make her mine
You know the tunnel of love well it ain't my style
So I'm gonna take on the ferris wheel
Way up in the sky with the stars in her eyes I'm gonna tell her just how I feel
Well there's a full moon...
[ guitar ]
Well I know Monday mornin' I'll be back on the fence-line but it'll be alright
Cause that perdy little girl says she's gonna be all mine
I'm gonna see her next Friday night
Well there's a full moon...

I've never been the kind
To bear my heart and soul,
Yeah I've always taken pride,
Staying in control.
I told myself,
I'd never fall too deep.
But girl you came along,
And made a liar out of me.
I'm as gone, as I, can be.
[Chorus]
I wanna breathe you in,
I wanna be so close,
You can wear my skin,
Like a new set of clothes.
So you can't even tell,
Where you end and I begin,
I wanna breathe you in.
I wanna breathe you in.
Your silhouette
And moonlight on the wall
As you crawl across the bed,
Beats all I ever saw
The smell of your hair,
Falling on my face.
Those red wine, kisses
Give a buzz with just one taste.
Girl you blow, me, away
[Chorus]
Again, and again, and again.
Until the sun comes up
Mm again, and again, and again,
I can't get enough.
I can't get enough.
[Chorus]
I wanna breathe you in.

By the banks of the river, where the willows hang down,
And the wild birds a'warble with a low moaning sound,
Down in the hollow where the water runs cold,
It was there I first listened, to the lies that you told
Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
And the past I remember, time can't erase
The letter you wrote me, it was written in shame,
And I know that your conscience still echos my name
Now the nights are so lonely, Lord sorrow runs deep
But nothing is worse than these nights without sleep
I walk out alone and look at the sky,
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry
If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrels with them high bushy tails,
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails

With a closet full of clothes, she's got nothing to wear
It's almost time to go and she can't do a thing with her hair
She asks me, "Do I look alright?"
I said, "Baby you look just fine"
But my love goes deeper, my love goes deeper than that
The beauty I see can't be bought off a rack
When God made her he used heaven and earth, he held nothing back
But my love goes deeper, my love goes deeper than that
We're out on the town, so she thought we'd celebrate
We raised our glass and toasted in memory of our first date
Looking back we've come so far
I'm still proud when she's on my arm
But my love goes deeper, my love goes deeper than that
The beauty I see can't be bought off a rack
When God made her he used heaven and earth, he held nothing back
But my love goes deeper, my love goes deeper than that

Just as far as I can remember she'll remain the rose of my heart
Mama took sick along in December February brought us broken hearts
The reason we've not called the family reunion is we knew that you wouldn't be there
But now that we thought it all over mama we know that the spirit is here
No no I can't forget the hours you're the only one mama and sweeter than the flowers
No no there's no need to bother to speak of you now would only hurt farther
Oh no mama I'll never forget you and someday I'll meet you up there
No no I can't forget the hours

Well when I was a little bitty boy no bigger than an old polecat
Well I used to wonder like all kids what made this to that
Now I'd seen what happened to my pa when he take a drink from a jug
Yeah he'd start with a smile and then after awhile he'd be out on the floor like rug
Corn liquor (corn liquor) corn liquor (corn liquor) what makes you do what you do
Well they feel no pain when you touch their brain corn liquor they love you
[ banjo ]
Well now one day in the afternoon my folks were away for awhile
Yeah I got the jug down from the shelf to see what made 'em smile
Now I slowly sip in the nearly flip that one drink was enough
For the life of me I just can't see why they love that awful stuff
Corn liquor (corn liquor)...
[ fiddle ]
Well as I grew older I thought about that first sip that I had
Yeah I really burned and soon I learned it wasn't all that bad
Now to ease the pressures of this world here's the way I've got it figured
Well the thing to do for me and you is drink lotsa good corn liquor
Corn liquor (corn liquor)...
Yeah I feel no pain when you touch my brain corn liquor I love you

Don't accuse me of being without feelings if you do you know that you're wrong
For it was you who was careless and you drove me into another's arms
The other woman isn't prettier than you
But the other woman soothes my wounded pride
And more important I feel wanted again I can't give up the other woman in my life
[ steel ]
I'm like a float in the middle of a river I can't climb out on either side
And if I go over the deep end it's because sweetheart you haven't tried
The other woman isn't prettier...

There's a little band reeling in my head whenever I see you smile.
I could kiss and tell if there's more to this one kiss that I could tell
We could fall all in love, baby let's fall all in love
Something like nothing that I've ever felt is moving inside of me.
I could kiss and ask if this love will last one kiss that I could tell
We could fall all in love, baby let's fall all in love
[Chorus]
I wanna live in the light of your love
Starting right here now today,
Live in the light of your love
Darling just show me the way.
I wanna live in the light of your love
Shine like the stars up above,
I wanna live in the light of your love,
Live in the light of your love.
There's not a sound in this whole wide world I couldn't whisper in my ear.
I can her your heart speak straight to mine it's beating right on time
We could fall all in love, baby let's fall all in love.
[Chorus]
I wanna live in the light of your love,
Live in the light of your love.

This is my kind of town
I ain't never seen nothin' like it
In all my traveling 'round
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
Well, this is my kind of town
There ain't no place on God's green earth
I'd rather be right now
Folks around here sure seem to know
What living's all about
I could hang around here forever
Lord, I feel so much at home
When it comes time for me to leave
It'll be so hard to go 'cause
This is my kind of town
I ain't never seen nothin' like it
In all my traveling 'round
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
Well, this is my kind of town
Now, I ain't the kind to just muscle in
On someone else's world
But from what I've seen it seems to me
They got lots of extra girls
And if I could find me one of them
And a little house nearby
Well, I'd park these boots, hang this hat
And stay here 'til I die 'cause
This is my kind of town
I ain't never seen nothin' like it
In all my traveling 'round
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
Well, this is my kind of town
If this old highway ever gives me up
And I think about settling down
Well, this is my kind of town

Precious Lord take my hand
Lead me on let me stand
For I am tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storms through the night
Lead me on to the light
Precious Lord take my hand and lead me home
Well I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things wee bad
There's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of outback dirt
We all get together in a circle and sing out
loud Daddy sand bass Mama sand tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seem to help a trouble soul
One o these days it won't be long
We'll all join in this song
We'll all get together up yonder 'round the throne
No the circle won't be broken
Bye and Bye Lord Bye and Bye
Daddy sang bass Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky Lord in the sky

You told me all i would need was a little time
But getting over you is still such an uphill climb
I know i ought to be living in the present tense
But the past i had with you was the last time
My life made sense
[Chorus:]
Call me crazy-for hurting this way
Call me crazy-go on and say
It's a phase i'm going through
Call me crazy-crazy over you
I know you don't really mean to be so unkind
But pardon me if i'm not in the right frame of mind
To go on hearing how i should start all over again
Face the future without you-
I wouldn't know how to begin
(repeat chorus)
Bridge:
You say I'm lost in a fantasy
But what we had was real to me
Call me crazy

One frozen night in 1914 at the height of World War One
The unthinkable happened
All along the entire western front
The British and German soldiers lay down their weapons
In an unofficial cease fire to celebrate Christmas Eve together
They exchanged gifts and saw each other as brothers
And that peace lasted for two more days
When they were ordered back to battle
In those few days, though
Men remembered the reason for Christmas
Amongst the devastation
And it's a story that should never be forgotten
Through the smoke filled night
Silence rolls from both sides
Across a bloody battlefield
It was a cold Christmas Eve in 1914
For those who were there it seemed unreal
As time was still, the spirit moved the soldiers
To lay down their arms, raise their voice in song
And pretend for a while the war was over
If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last
As opposing sides approached
Through broken words they spoke
It wasn't long before they felt at ease
They shared their cigarettes
What they had they used as gifts
They didn't feel like enemies
With candles lit, they stood shoulder to shoulder
And on that field they found true common ground
And as they prayed, they dreamed the war was over
If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last
If it could happen then, it could happen again

You don't want to see me,
You're not into wastin' time
You think I won't, but believe me,
I'll stand right by your side
And if you go you'll never know
A love from a heart like mine
But baby you don't have to be
Lonely all the time
You're thinkin' hard 'bout the complications,
Scared of what the future might bring
Well maybe baby you should stop pointin' fingers,
Find out if the finger fits the ring
And if you stay your heart'll lead the way
To a love that you can't deny
But baby you don't have to be
Lonely all the time
I don't wanna see you headin' down that lonesome road
You can be certain that the ride is awful slow
You're workin' hard for your picket fences
And your two point three
Well I'm a little reckless but I don't mind fences,
If the gate swings free
Through the gate lies a garden that grows
Full of love from a heart like mine
But baby you don't have to be lonely,
Lonely all the time [Repeat: x4]

BABY PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON
Writers Bill Anderson, Buddy Cannon, Paul Overstreet
RECORDED BY TRACY BYRD
Baby put your clothes on, put on those brand new shoes
I wanna take you downtown, I gotta little blues to lose
I wanna see you dancing, swinging to a country song
I love to show you off, baby put your clothes on
We been sittin 'round here hardly doin' nothin'
I think we need a little bit of belt-buckle rubbin'
Where the lights are low and the music's fine
Wouldn't hurt us none to have a little you and me time
Baby put your clothes on, paint up those pretty lips
Put on those cool blue jeans, the ones that ride low on your hips
You know you make their heads turn
Little girl you look so strong
I love to show you off, baby put your clothes on
Baby put your clothes on, put on those brand new shoes
I wanna take you downtown, I got a little blues to lose
I wanna see you dancing, swingin' to a country song
I love to show you off, baby put your clothes on
We been sittin 'round here hardly doin' nothin'
I think we need a little bit of belt-buckle rubbin'
Where the lights are low and the music's fine
Wouldn't hurt us none to have a little you and me time

[Chorus:]
Run away little tears
You've been locked up too long
Run away little tears our baby's gone
I look at his picture
Touchin old souvenir
And then grow weak from holding back these locked up tears
[Repeat Chorus:]
A storm of emotion keeps on working within
Breaking down a heart that only he could mend
[Repeat Chorus:]
Run away little tears our baby's gone

I always thought you were the best
I guess I always will
I always thought that we were blessed
And I feel that way still
Sometimes we took the hard road
But we always saw it through
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
Sometimes the world was on our side
Sometimes it wasn't fair
Sometimes it gave a helping hand
Sometimes we didn't care
'Cause when we were together
It made the dream come true
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
Someone who understands me
And knows me inside out
Helps keep me together
And believes without a doubt,
That I could move a mountain
Someone to tell it to
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
Someone
And knows me inside out
Helps keep me together
And believes without a doubt,
That I could move a mountain
Someone to tell it to
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you

I wish I could step out of my mind
Then I could be someone that's never known you
But I can't change the way I am much less the way you feel
Or you'd be loving me forever still
I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again
If I had a way of changing time
I?d stay busy turning back the pages
If I could make a miracle, I'd make one just for you
And you'd be loving me forever too
I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again, you'd love me forever again

(His robe his robe the robe of calvary
Twas worn by my redeemer who lives eternaly)
Kings wear robes of gold and velvet soon their glory fades away
But the king of kings in heaven wore a homespun robe that day
Soldiers gambled for his garment while the sun turned dark above
But the men who crucified him were forgiven by his love
His robe his robe...
Those who saw his robe knew torment if they lived by sin and fault
But if they renounce the evil they were welcome by the Lord
Though it seems so plain and humble there was fate in every breath
He who wore that lives forever he has risen from the death

Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go, so
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's gonna take me home, so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

The sun reflected on a passing car
Flashed like a signal or a star
I saw myself die under an on coming semi
Wanting to say I love planet earth
One road goes through the reservation
With one casino and one gas station
Rusted VW bug upside down
By the side of the road
Wanting to say I love planet earth
Acres of golden hills before us
Turn blue and lavender too
In the rear view mirror
If I was a hawk I'd circle the mountains
Set sail moon over Oklahoma
Spindly trees lead you to New Orleans
Wanting to say I love planet earth
Majestic red rocks stand like walls
Black clouds like fists beat the sky
God help us all
If I was the land I'd wear my hair down
If I was the sea I'd follow the sun
If I was the sky I'd open my arms
Wanting to say I love planet earth

I've been down on my luck,
I've been shadowed with trouble and sorrow.
But I ain't givin' up'
'Cause I know there is always tomorrow.
There are no guarantees,
Life is always a hit or miss.
But I truly believe
I won't always be feeling' like this.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
When it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I will prove my own worth,
Heal the damage and hurt that's been done.
And when the cryin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I've been thinking here lately
What all I can do to improve.
Though I've suffered greatly,
I know just what I have to do.
I have to move forward,
Cut losses, break loose and move on.
And I have to swim shoreward
Lest I should drown out here alone.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
I won't crawl I can run
I'll be at no ones mercy no more.
I'll be swinging on sunbeams
So proud that I finally won.
And when the losin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine.
I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When these clouds roll away from my door.
And when it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I'll be off chasin' rainbows,
Rejoicin' and havin' my fun.
And when the cryin's all done,
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When the cryin's all done,
When the tryin's all done,
When the lyin's all done
There'll be nothin' but sun.
When it's all said and done
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun, shine like the sun.

(Dolly Parton)
This is not at all like me
I never thought that I could be
So over-come by any one like this
But you caught me by surprise
Caught me before I realized, now
I am lost forever in your kiss
So take me if you want me
Love me if you will
For you have all control of me
I am yours until
You say that you don't want me
Oh, I hope that never will be
For I am lost forever in your kiss
You're on my mind constantly
On, this is all so new to me
And when you reach for me I can't resist
For I've become a part of you
And I'll do anything you want me to, for

She'll poison your heart
And break down your resistance
Like the bite of a rattler
At close striking distance
She'll show you no mercy
And tear you apart
She tempts and she taunts
She flirts and flaunts
She gets what she wants
On nights when she's lonely
She'll just drop by
She won't come out and say it
But it's clear in her eye
Sometimes I hold her
And sometimes I don't
Whenever it goes
As far as I know
She gets what she wants
Oh and she

Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever....
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key

I used to laugh at all those songs
`bout the rambling life, the nights so long and lonely
Well, I ain't laughin' now
Now that I'm caught up, it seems
In all the same ambitious dreams
That only lonely life allows
And the home I don't go home to
The friends I don't see
Aren't the part of this life
That endears it to me
If that's the price I have to pay
For doing things my own way
Then it's what I'll have to do somehow
[Chorus]
Till I find my way back to my heart
For there's no one but me's gonna take my part
It's too early to say that it's over
Or to find we can make a new start
It's too early to say
Till I find my way back to my heart
I thought at least we'd meet again
Since we have been the best of friends and lovers to each other
Meet again and speak our minds
Force no issues, turn no blind eye
Toward the road that lies ahead
But it seems that I missed you
By a coast and a song
When time gets so short
"So what?" turns to "so long"
I cannot keep your love inside
It's a flame I cannot hide forever
In the name of hanging on
[Chorus]
I used to laugh at all those songs
'bout the rambling life, the nights so long and lonely

Sometimes I really think it's over
But your blue eyes have never lost a fool
One kiss and I'm right back believing
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you
You always find all the scattered pieces
Your words turn lies back into truth
Your love opens every door it closes
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you
Your touch knows the fine art of healing
Your heart knows when to make it's move
Practice makes perfect, don't it, darling
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you
You always find all the scattered pieces
Your words turn lies back into truth
Your love opens every door it closes
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you
Oh, no one mends a broken heart like you

I'm blown away when I look at you
While you look at me
'Cause you see me so completely
I'm overwhelmed by the way it feels
'Cause I know it's real
When you reach out to touch me
You consume me, you know I can't resist
And you move me, oh, with the power of a little kiss
It feels like a ton of love
Followed by a mountain of
Emotions coming over me
To take complete control of me
And I get swept away
Deeper in it every day
And Lord I swear that I'll never give you up
'Cause girl you hit my heart with a ton of love
When we're apart, you're in my heart
You're on my mind
'Cause our souls are connected
And when the distance between us grows
Everybody knows
That we're not affected
And when you're with me, It's heaven right here on Earth
Oh, Girl you give me more than any one man could deserve
It feels like a ton of love
Followed by a mountain of
Emotions coming over me
To take complete control of me
And I get swept away
Deeper in it every day
And Lord I swear that I'll never give you up
'Cause girl you hit my heart with a ton of love
Oh Girl, I get swept away
Deeper in it every day
And Lord I swear that I'll never give you up
'Cause girl you hit my heart with a ton of love
Mmmm, I'm blown away when I look at you
You take complete control of me
You consume me...
Oh, girl you move me
When we're apart you're in my heart

There is someone walking behind you turn around look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps turn around look at me
There is someone who really loves you here's my heart in my hand
Turn around look at me understand
That there is someone to stand beside you turn around look at me
There is someone to love and guide you turn around look at me
I've been waiting but I'll wait forever for you to come to me
Look at someone who really loves you turn around look at me

If you've never felt what happens
When two hearts thaw together
Or never seen love written in the stars
And knew it was forever
If you don't believe that destiny
Can start with just one wish
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
A broken heart can always live in fear
Afraid to fall
I can make those feelings disappear
In no time at all
If you wanna feel the world stand still
From the magic of one kiss
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
Oh, baby, watch this

Straight shot of misery
Some days make a mess of me
I touch the ground when I can find my feet
You know it all comes down to love
I tell myself I can do it all
I juggle everything
I drop the ball
Sometimes it feels my life's impossible
But then it all comes down to
Love
I'd love to take you on a time machine
Fill those cracks things fall between
So we could find more days to fly away from the hurricane
But in the ebb and flow
It all comes down to love
Oh, it all comes down to love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock chimes
The babies cry
I turn around and he's six feet high
And as I let him go and
I watch him fly
I know it all comes down to love
I light the candles and I'll cut the cake
Make a wish for every heart that breaks
Sweet forgiveness never made a mistake
You know it all comes down to
Love
I could love you 'till my heart's content
I know you must be Heaven sent
The way you sweep me up in your arms in the middle of an argument
And you let me know
It all comes down to love
Oh, it all comes down to love
Take you down to guts and the rubble
Diggin' up the deeper stuff
You gotta trust when you're runnin' into trouble
That it all comes down to
Love
Love
Love
Love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it all comes down to love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it all comes down to love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it all comes down to love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Till the rivers all run dry till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through I'll be needing you
I know sometimes you may wonder from litte things I say and do
But there's no need for you to wonder if I need you cause I'll need you
Till the rivers all run dry till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through I'll be needing you
Too many times I don't tell you too many things get in the way
And even though sometimes I hurt you still you show me in every way
Till the rivers all run dry till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through I'll be needing you.

I'm begging to you and I want to go with you
You're breaking my heart as you say goodbye
I hope and I pray we'll soon be together
My heart is so full, it's hard not to cry
What will I do when the leaves start falling?
The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Soon the flowers will die, don't let love die with them
And with you gone, dear, what will I do?
Your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
And your mournful eyes, they keep haunting me
But to know that you're mine, it makes life worth living
Oh, the time's gone by, a sweet memory
I'm trusting in you but each hour seems longer
I'm counting the days when I'll be with you
Our hearts are entwined, they're blessed with the future
A safe journey home I'm waiting for you

I've seen more than a Little Texas, and a Playboy always knows
A man does what he Wills as long as he stays on his toes
He can Russell up a fortune, any man could strike it Rich
But I'm doing good to keep it Strait and keep my wheels out of the ditch
Ain't no Foster for the Desert Rose, the babblin' Brooks are Dunn
That Crystal ball won't even book me one day in the Sun
I'm Haggard, worn and Waylon from the bottom of my Restless Heart
Don't know Wy the Black cloud's tailin' me, there seems to be no Parton from the dark
And I've had it to the Gills of knowin' what the Nitty Gritty's all about
Bein' McEntired and Loveless I can't Lovett if I'm all Tuckered out
Well, I never meant to set out like a half-cocked Gatlin gun
No highway Head Hunter's gonna let this Rabbitt run
I ain't Raven 'bout The Ride, I probably got no fate to Seal
If I can't roll through Alabama half Asleepin' At The Wheel
All my Paycheckes are like dried up Wells and way too small to Cash
Or I'd find a roadside motel, lay some money down to Crash
I'm Haggard, worn and Waylon from the bottom of my Restless Heart
Don't know Wy the Black cloud's tailin' me, there seems to be no Parton from the dark
And I've had it to the Gills of knowin' what the Nitty Gritty's all about
Bein' McEntired and Loveless I can't Lovett if I'm all Tuckered out

I'm gonna change my ways of 'doin things around here
I'm turning over a new leaf ,gonna get my self in gear
'Cause I've got a women who's better then most,
And I've made a mess of her plains
Starting today ,all I'm gonna be is her man
'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter
Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter
I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures
I'm even more than I can stand
But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man
I'm gonna give it all back, cause all I've done is take
Well I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make
But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me
A second chance again
And startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man
'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter
Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter
I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures
I'm even more than I can stand
But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

There's not a lot of things to do
I wouldn't rather do with you
Guess I'm funny that way
Lately I just sit and stare
I talk to people who aren't there
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I sit up with the radio
Sing along with the ones I know
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I'm callin' every friend I've had
Wake 'em up, and make 'em mad
Let 'em know that I'm OK
I used to sit and talk to you
They're all just a substitute
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away

Darling you know it's true
The rumor you heard about me living you
Well I never told a soul
So tell me how the whole world knows
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
Well I've got a ring and a plan
But I see you already know what I'm gonna ask
I never said a thing
Tell me what gave it away
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
Yes you do
I heard it too

I'm rain
Falling from a cloud on the edge of town
No trace
Of a storm I used to be
You got me
Gone
Youre turning it on
Oh Showing just enough skin
You got me gone
The blue and the blonde
Your pretty lips whispering
Saying everything you wanna do to me
Soon as you get me alone
But you got me, gone
You got me
I'm a mess
Hearts beating out of my chest
And I'm a wreck
The dress you used to have on
You got me, gone
Youre turning it on
Showing just enough skin
You got me gone
The Blue and the blonde
Your Pretty lips whispering
Saying everything you wanna do to me
Soon as you get me alone
But you got me gone
You got me gone

Here comes Peter Cottontail
Hoppin' down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppin', Easter's on its way
Bringin' every girl and boy
Baskets full of Easter joy
Things to make your Easter bright and gay
He's got jelly beans for Tommy
Colored eggs for sister Sue
There's an orchid for your mommy
And an Easter bonnet too
Oh! here comes Peter Cottontail
Hoppin' down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppity, happy Easter Day
Here comes Peter Cottontail
Hoppin' down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppin', Easter's on its way
Try to do the things you should
Maybe if you're extra good
He'll roll lots of Easter eggs your way
You'll wake up on Easter mornin'
And you'll know that he was there
When you find those chocolate bunnies
That he's hiding everywhere
Oh! here comes Peter Cottontail
Hoppin' down the bunny trail
Hippity hoppity, happy Easter Day
Hippity hoppity, happy Easter Day

What a time to turn your back on someone
What a day to be without a friend
What a shame when no-one seems to bother
Who will offer shelter to candles in the wind
And it follows we are only helpless children
Ever changing like sunlight through the trees
It's a long road we must cling to one another
Help yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to be
And it's said that life is like a ladder
Just a dream we're reaching for the stars
Can't you see how little really matters
We are only searching for what we really are
And it follows we are only helpless children
Ever changing like sunlight through the trees
It's a long road we must cling to one another
Help yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to be

Well I ain't gonna marry
Neither settle down
I'm gonna sit right here
'Til I tear this barrel house down
Ain't no use a weepin' and there ain't no need to cry
Because you got a home
Just as long as I got mine
Well I loves you baby
And I'll tell the world I do
I don't love nobody
In this whole round world but you
Did you get that letter
Mailed in your backyard
Well it's sad what they said
But your best old friend had to part

Here's my keys, I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
[Chorus]

Cledus at the kitchen table
Short of breath, legally disabled
Wife walks in, she's so surprised
Can't believe I'm still alive
I say I'm hungry for biscuits and gravy
That patty melt that you always made me
But I can't eat that anymore
They say grease kills, tastes good to me
Day in, day out, it's all I eat
My third bypass, unclogged the valves
Just to clog them again
Never felt worse, a constant thirst
Lordy how my left arm hurts
I blame my job, I blame my wife
For this coronary life
Cledus on the ER table
Vital signs ain't too stable
"Hey, Doc, I'm proud of you
I didn't think that I'd pull through"
Later in Intensive Care
I had the nurses laughing there
So thankful Blue Cross will pay
For the bills, my IVs
Four thousand dollar, EKGs
That's the last time I need
Angioplasty
It's off I go to Tye-Bo
To improve my cardio
It's about time I said goodbye
To my coronary life
Sweat's pouring off me at the health spa
The Stairmaster's wore me out again
You know I can't believe how much I miss
The way I used to live
I'd eat red meat, pickled pigs' feet
Always craving something sweet
My food was fast but that's the past
I can't eat fat again
Aerobicize, reduced my thighs
No more German chocolate pie
I miss my fudge, I miss my fries
And my coronary life

By David Allan Coe
Dedicated to Dr. Martin Scheid who saved my life when my appendix busted in Houston, and to all the people who came to my last concerts of 1978 and didn't complain that I was only able to sing from a wheel chair.
I SPENT A LIFETIME IN PRISON BELIEVING ID NEVER GET OVER THE FALL
BUSTED FOR FIRST DEGREE I WAS TO BLIND TO SEE WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR IT ALL
SOME SAID THE DEVIL, BUT GOD ONLY KNOWS IF I PUT MY FUTURE IN HIM
OTHER FOLKS BET THAT ID NEVER GET ON MY FEET AGAIN
RUNNING AND JUMPING FREE AS A BIRD JUST LIKE A CHILD LEFT TO PLAY
FREEDOM WAS ONE MORE THING I TOOK FOR GRANTED UNTIL THEY TOOK IT AWAY
MARRIAGES BREAKUP AND SOME PEOPLE TAKE UP DRINKING TO MAKE THEM FORGET
BOTH OF THEM SWEARING, NEITHER ONE CARING WISHING THAT THEY NEVER MET
TAKING THE CHILD AWAY, WHO CARES WHAT CHILDREN SAY UNTIL THEY TURN INTO MEN
SOMEDAY YOU'LL SEE I'm GONNA BE ON MY FEET AGAIN

Leaving is the longest word I ever learned
In the time it takes to say it, the whole world has turned
If a heartbeat lasts a lifetime then I've lived before
'cause I remember standing at this open door
[Chorus]
This path is not the one I'd choose to travel
Even as we watch what tied us unravel
And the tears fall like rain
Deeper than crying, the loving still remains
Neither wants to be the one to say goodbye
And neither wants to be the one who's left to cry
But in our secret heart of hearts we both know
That the time for patching up has passed and it's time to go
[Chorus]
So I'll be the one to pull our tangled lives apart
I won't dodge the angry words that hide a broken heart
And my calm fare-thee-wells cannot obscure
That deep inside, my heart is also hurtin' so
[Chorus]

I gas up my truck and I drive into town
But I spend all my time just ridin' around
Tryin' to shake this negative mood I'm in
I know where to go if I want to get down
All the usual suspects are hangin' around
But after a round or two, it's just another dead end
For a minute or two, I'll get you off my mind
But you keep comin' back to me every time
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
I bury myself in my job all day
Just tryin' to get lost in the usual ways
Smilin' and laughin' and jokin' around with the guys
Gotta do something to deaden the pain
So I stare at the window just watchin' the rain
But all I can see in the haze is the grey of your eyes
So what do I do with all the pieces of you in me
If you're never comin' back, set me free
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on plane, and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said, and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
Where do I go from you
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane, and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said, and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
Where do I go from you

Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill

She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you, need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you, need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that
Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you, need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a neon light

Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Would you be free from your passion and pride
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Would you be whiter,
much whiter than snow?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood (in the blood) of the Lamb (of the Lamb)
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Last Friday evenin'
I went to dry heavin'
Bent over double in pain
From out of my mouth
And right on a new Lexus
One hell of a load I sure swang
On my knees, I was throwin'
The owner was goin'
Inside to pay for his gasoline
I'm in a mess at the Texaco
Barfin' up refried beans
I'm down at the Texaco
Sick as a dog
My stomach's churnin'
My tail end is raw
I swear it's the last time
I'll eat another taco supreme
I'm in a mess at the Texaco
Barfin' up refried beans
No this picture ain't purdy, I ate number 30
And drank too much Mexican beer
Four shots of tequila, don't mix with fajitas
I'm prayin' a bathroom is near
I OD'd on tamales and green guacamole
Lord, I hope that the toilet is clean
I'm in a mess at the Texaco
Barfin' up refried beans
I'm down at the Texaco, smell like a hog
Knee deep in poo poo, the commode was clogged
Who used it the last time, ooh boy did it stink
Shoo at the Texaco because of those refried beans
I'm down at the Texaco, where's Tim McGraw?
While I'm sittin' here peelin' the paint off the walls
He's probably sippin' fine wine and dining on fancy cuisine
While I'm here at the Texaco from eatin' them refried beans
A mess at the Texaco from eatin' them refried beans
I said I'd be out in a minute
There

Mhm mhm mhm
You're my soul song my everything-that-I-do song
My pick-me-up-when-I'm-blue song that's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song and that's why I call you my solid-gold song
Nothin' in the world could ever go wrong as long as you are mine
Never in the world have I seen anybody like you in all my time
You give me a feel good feelin' through and through and it's so fine
I'm up with the sun cause I don't wanna waste it
I love you so much I can almost taste it
I can sit still when I look up and see you comin' I start hummin' hmm
You're my soul song my keep-me-safe-from-all-harm song
My shelter-from-all-storm song that's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song my keep-me-warm-when-I'm-cold song
Nothin' in the world could ever go wrong as long as you are mine
You're my soul song

The door into the tavern
Opens easy in my hand
I get an understanding smile
From my bartender friend
And he pours me a double
Nothing 'bout it seems too hard
He opens up a tab for me
With my credit card, it's so
Loser friendly, loser friendly
Everything is easy as can be
Loser friendly, loser friendly
Friendly to a loser such as me
The girl who waits on tables
Comes up behind my chair
Helps me with a hand or two
Of video solitaire
She leans in close and whispers
"Are you all alone?
'Cause I get off in a little while
If you'd like to take me home," she's so
Loser friendly, loser friendly
Everything is easy as can be
Loser friendly, loser friendly
Friendly to a loser such as me
We all have our ups and downs
The rain must fall some days
But when it does it's good to know
You can find this kind of place, it's so
Loser friendly, loser friendly
Everything is easy as can be
Loser friendly, loser friendly
Friendly to a loser such as me
Friendly to a loser such as me

This old man and me, were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and swaping 'I don't cares'
Talking politics, blond and red-head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace and all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say;
"God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
He said "I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"
We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet;
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
Last call its two a.m., I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day, I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary, he was a millionaire
He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew, his kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today, to just say thanks and pray,
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave and I said;
'God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy"
God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.
God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.

travelling with the rodeo its the only life he'll ever no
started in new mexico musta been a thousand years ago
and he use to be the best they say at riding young wild horses
for his pay
now he's much to old it seems he only rides wild horses in his dreams.
they told him ride em' cowboy dont let em' throw you down
you wont make no money if you hit the ground
ride em' cowboy dont let em' throw you down
your the toughest cowboy in town.

Spread your wings, don't be afraid to try
The world can be hard, you gotta live a little 'fore you die
So open that door, step out in the bright sunshine
Follow your heart, and remember any time
You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home
So pack your bags, smile and say goodbye
And chase those dreams, and when you lay down and die
You know that there's someone praying for you every day
Even if you never find your way
You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home
When I was young, my daddy said to me
The very same words and I took those words with me
When I was afraid, I'd pull them out and think
Just how much they mean to me
You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

(Gordon Kennedy/Wayne Kirkpatrick)
They married on a fancy yacht out on the water
He knew she was young enough to be his daughter
There always questions in the heart of millionaires
Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there
And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold
She ran his weary heart through the ringer
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
Well, his advances and affections, she managed to avoid
But, she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid
And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold, digging for gold
Big house, limousines,
Fine wines, fine cuisines,
Vale and Vegas twice a year,
Trips to Paris on the leer
Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown
And he said, hey babe, we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more
But he barely got his feelings out, she was half way to the door
And she never even heard him cry
Do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold

The cold tonight seems more anxious to talk
Than he has seemed in nights before
Skinless face and yellow heart, he
Hesitates and I wait
All my stories are about the same things
I find so many beds for them
I find this package of tiny lamps
And it makes a firey ring
Right now is the reason I carry this jewel
Everywhere round my neck
I keep it close but still outside
This is my explanation
All my stories are about the same things
I find so many beds for them
I find this package of tiny lamps
And it makes a firey ring
A box of love and sex and reflection
Its got my face and hands
The lonely is yellow and old
Watch the cold around my bed
All my stories are about the same things
I find so many beds for them
I find this package of tiny lamps
And it makes a firey ring

Well honey did I ever tell you just how wonderful you are
Every time you hold me I'll be floatin' with the stars in the sky
I wonder why I guess it's love love love love
Well baby did I ever tell you that you're the greatest guy
Honey are you with me when I look into your eyes
I wonder why I wonder why I guess it's love love love love
Well now don't you know you send me where I never been before
I just want to let you know I love you so
Well I like to hear you talkin' but you're wastin' your time
You're not playin' nothin' that I don't already know
Well baby did I ever tell you that you got what it takes
And every time you tuck me in your arms I shake
I wonder why I wonder why I guess it's love love love love
[ steel ]
Well now don't you know you send me...
I guess it's love love love love I guess it's love love love love

Burgers and fires and cherry pies it was simple and good back then
Walkin' in the sand hand in hand never thinkin' that it could end
Makin' our love with the moon above at the drive-in picture show
And it was burgers and fires and cherry pies in a world we used to know
Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
Oh the things we used to say little things we did each day
Oh I long to do the things that we did before
Well it was burgers and fires
Well I'm still the same ole me that's all I'll ever be
I'd like to think that you're the same ole you
We lost something down the line and I wish we both could find
Lord I'd like to do the things that we used to do
It was burgers and fires
Oh it was so simple back then

Blackbird was in the field and the sun was getting dim
The breeze running through the trees like an organ in a hymn
Thoughts were suspended like a leaf out on a limb
Fire was burning low and the winter coming in
Now some music was playing in the background of the night
Some friends from around came in and they all said things were high
And we spoke of a stranger that we all met on the way
Who said there was danger in those who watch out for their greed
Now the summer is past the grain and the river getting high
It's amazing a month can bring so many things that can get by
The old ways were drowning to the new ones with a sigh
It seems so incredible that sometimes I could cry.

Well I would if I could and if I got the chance make love to you right after the dance
We'll park by the river underneath the moon on my old guitar I'll play you a tune
Well things will be right and the moon will be bright
And maybe you'll let me hold you tight
Stick around baby and give me the chance to make love to you right after the dance
Well we won't quarrel and we won't fight and maybe we'll stay out all the night
I'll hug and kiss you if you'll give me the chance
To make love to you right after the dance
We'll bill and coo and patch a little woo and maybe you'll say oh yes I do
Well I'll be the teacher if you'll take a chance
And we'll have call for preacher right after the dance
We'll bill and coo...

Fall down on me like a feather
Floating on a breeze
Faintest whisper softest calling
I am on my knees
Lead me to the ledge and let me
Dangle from a limb
I just hang on hear me praying
Oh no not again
Look for heaven out the window
Abalone sky
Scattered pearly shimmer sending
Angels to my side
Helping hasten hope's return to
Free me from your grasp
I just hang on hear me praying
Oh this too shall pass
Scattered pearly shimmer sending
Angels to my side
Look for heaven out the window
Abalone sky

To tell me you forgotten me is like telling me a lie
To think that you love someone else is enough to make me die
Your love is mine and I'll tell you now I don't want someone new
I just want a happy life and live it all with you
If you're willing to forget the bad things I have done
I didn't mean to break your heart from now on you're the one
Forever and forever we'll be so far from blue
I just want a happy life and live it all with you
[ steel - piano ]
If you're willing to forget...
I just want a happy life and live it all with you

Something More Besides You
One foot stands before the crib
The other by the casket.
A question formed upon stilled lips
Is passed on but never asked.
I guess I believe that there's a point
In what we do.
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?
Two are born to cross
Their paths, their lives, their hearts.
If by chance one turns away
Are they forever lost?
I guess I believe that there's a point
To what we do.
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?
This morning I awoke,
The bed warm where it once was cold.
Small blessings laid upon us.
Small mysteries slowly unfold.
Yet I still wonder is there a point
To what we do?
'Cause I kind of doubt
That there is something more besides you.
Although it's hard to find the point
To what we do,
Do I dare believe that there is
Something more besides you?

I saw her for the first time when the snow was falling down
And Lord she was the cutest thing I've ever seen
Great big green eyes a flashin' ruby lips a smilin'
Well my heart went pitter patter and I knew it was gonna shatter
If I couldn't make that little gal my own
You can sing about your sweet Joly Blon
You can sing about them pretty gals down in Tennessee
You can sing your song about that Yellow Rose of Texas
But the one by the Powder River that runs through old Kaycee
That Wyoming girls the only one for me
I've been around this big country and I've seen a lot of women in my time
Well there ain't none sweeter and there ain't none better
Than this little gal I call mine and I thank you Lord for making her my wife
You can sing about...

How could he take you in his arms and help you to be free
Then leave you forgotten and is it enough to cry?
When you're so broken
Her cold eyes tell you you're not welcome she tells lies
But you'll take her back again and is it enough to die?
When you're so taken
You will be loved again
You will be loved again
But will she sing and will she dance
And will she forever and will he sing
And will he dance and will he forever
Someday you will feel a love so deep
And you'll find someone not lost in sleep
And you will be loved again you will be loved again you will be loved again

The way you kissed me this morning
It told me that you soon would be going
You didn't even look in my eyes
When you said goodbye
And last night in your sleep you broke all the promises
That I knew you would never keep
Now I'm reading the letter which you placed on the dresser
And you're five hundred miles down the road
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced
Yeah, I remember when we said 'forever'
Was the craziest word that we knew
But I think that I like it much better than I do 'goodbye'
And I could sit here all evening and think of the reasons
Why you are not by my side
Instead I'll go to the kitchen, find a strong chair to sit in
And drink myself far, far away
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced

We don't like to go out shopping, we don't care what's on sale
Just wanna sit with a bag full of chips watchin' the NFL
When you come over at half time, you say does this dress fit too tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
And say uh uh looks just right
Well that's the truth about men, that's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf on our days off, scratch and spit and cuss
And no matter what line we hand you when we come dragging in
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry, and it's probably gonna happen again
We hate watchin' Steel Magnolias, we like Rambo and Die Hard four
Jump up and down like fools when we see the new tools
At the Home Depot store we don't really
Wanna take you to dinner at some fancy restaurant
The only reason we do is 'cause we know it leads to
The one thing that we all want
Well, that's the truth about men, that's the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Than work on the problems in our lives
And though we say it to you every now and then
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry, and it's probably gonna happen again
Well, if you wanna know what we're all thinkin', it's nothing too complex
It's just something cold for drinking and a whole lot of s,e, yes
That's the truth about men, that's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit and a whole lot of other disgusting stuff
And no matter what line we give you when we come crawling in
We ain't wrong, we ain't sorry and it's probably gonna happen again
We ain't wrong, We ain't sorry, and it's probably gonna happen
Sure it's gonna happen, you know it's gonna happen again
And that's the truth about men

She never knew my name, least not the one my daddy gave me
I took off the way I came, moonlight reflectin' off the road
She didn't want my story, so I didn't have to lie
If I loved her it was only for a night
[Chorus]
Livin' life on the run, you can't give your heart to no one
Your only friend is the settin' sun I, didn't do what they said I done, I gotta
Stay one step ahead or one of these days I'm gonna wake up dead
Dropped in my tracks by a bullet from a lawman's gun
Oh, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
Here we go
The white lines on the road, that's the only trail I leave behind me
Been chasin' high-line poles, ever since the night I skipped out of town
Somewhere in the distance, is where I need to be
All I care about right now is speed
[Chorus]
Here they come now, gotta lay low
Done bent the law 'til the law got broke
Here they come now, gotta lay low
Low, low, low, low,
Here they come now, they're closin' in
Pack of bloodhounds gonna catch my scent
Here they come now, now gone again
Yeah
Livin' life on the run,
You can't give your heart to no one,
You can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
No, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life, on the run

(Goodbye sunshine)
Goodbye sunshine gee but I'll miss your smile
Don't cry sunshine I'll be back in a while
And when I'm lonesome and the lonely tears start
I'll think of you and there'll be bluebirds in my heart
Keep those blue eyes full of love just for me
And there'll be blue skies anyplace I may be
And don't you worry everything will be fine I'll walk the line
Here comes the train kiss me again goodbye sunshine
(Goodbye sunshine)
Keep those blue eyes full of love...
Goodbye sunshine (goodbye)

She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

My first recollection is a day in December
Black iron steam engine covered in ice
Like some Precambrian monster
Moaning and snorting
Nothing was ever going to beat that beast
In a fair fight
I've sat and watched the woodpiles
Grow through the summer
Now I'm sitting, smelling summer burn through the fall
Winter's coming on, days getting dreary
And I'm thinking this is the season
That I leave you all
I've heard a man in crisis
Falls back on what he knows best,
A murderer to murder
A thief to theft
And I don't want you to think
That this is some kind of deathbed confession
But run is what I did when put to the test
My first recollection is a day in December
747 tracing lines through the sky
Like some old gypsy curse
Silently preying upon the dreams of those
Who jealously watch life pass by
I've sat and watched my troubles
Pile through the summer
Now I'm sitting, hearing my youngest cry
Down the hall
Winter's coming on, days getting dreary
And I'm thinking this is the season
That I leave you all
I've heard that the son must bear
The burdens of the father
But it's the daughter that is left
To clean up the mess
And I don't want you to think
That I'm asking for absolution,
But run is what I did when put to the test

[Chorus]
Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of goin' 'round n' 'round
I played the game of love and lost
So, stop the world and let me off.
My dreams are shattered don't you see
Now you no longer care for me
I miss the wonder of your kiss
How could you leave me here like this?
[Chorus: x5]

I had it all lined up
Then my future crashed
I heard the deadbolt lock
And there stood my past
But there are no signs for tomorrow
On the back roads of my sorrow
I could beg, steal
I could borrow
But the grace will have to come to me
[Chorus]
I'm gonna shake my soul
And release my hold
Givin' up control
And let the rest unfold
Cause it's a long, long way from here to where we go
Take off the training wheels
Lift off the handle bars
I'll drive right through my fears
And resurrect my heart
And even in my darkest hour
When my tears staye undercover
I know it one way or another
Love is coming back around to me
[Chorus]
In the face that I wore as a child
I can see myself
Every day of my life I'm tring just to free myself
To be myself
And the rain comes I can hear it
Like a bass drum loud and clear it's
Ancient wisdom of the spirit
Ali, Ali all come free
[Chorus]
It's a long, long way from here to where we go

Can I beg can I borrow
Can I steal one more tomorrow
The day is done another wasted
Why do I spend them all waiting
As the last
Shadow falls
Hear my prayer
Hear my call
What is here what was never
What will last what's gone forever
Twists and turns then it splinters
One day sweet next day bitter
Shifting sands
Underneath
Knock me off
Of my feet
Take a breath then take another
One last step take cover
Time is short unfurl my fingers
Shine a light where darkness lingers
All is lost
All is found
Say goodbye
To the ground

(Daddy what if the sun stop shinin' what would happen then)
If the sun stopped shinin' you'd be so surprised
You'd stare at the heavens with wide open eyes
And the wind would carry your light to the skies
And the sun would start shinin' again
(Daddy what if the wind stopped blowin' what would happen then)
If the wind stopped blowin' then the land would be dry
And your boat wouldn't sail son and your kite wouldn't fly
And the grass would see your troubles and she'd tell the wind
And the wind would start blowin' again
(But daddy what if the grass stopped growin' what would happen then)
If the grass stopped growin' why you'd probably cry
And the ground would be watered by the tears from your eyes
And like your love for me the grass would grow so high
Yes the grass would start growin' again
(But daddy what if I stopped lovin' you what would happen then)
If you stopped lovin' me then the grass would stop growin'
The sun would stop shinin' and the wind would stop blowin'
So you see if you wanna keep this old world a goin'
You better start lovin' me again again you better start lovin' me again
You hear me Bobby you better start lovin' me again
You love me Bobby you better start lovin' me again

If I were free what I would do
I'd run and lock myself away with you
And turn a ring into a key
Oh I know that's what I'd do
If I were free
If I were strong I would be so mild
I would be strong enough to love you like a child
I would turn a cry into a song
Oh I know that's what I would do
If I were strong
If I were wise then I would see
What makes you love a foolish man like me
I'd stand by you just like a tree
Oh I know that's what I would do
I would chain myself to you
I would never leave this room if I were free
A line of birds across the sun
Darling it's my fate to follow on the run
But girl this running is not for me
I would never run again if I were free
And here's just what I'd do
I would chain myself to you
I would never leave this room if I was free

I met her out in Oklahoma down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
We walked alone down by the river just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble like the muddy waters down below
Her lips were soft and sweet as honey her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
And then one day a tall dark stranger with hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling and there he met my Rosie Jones
I woke next morning just after sunup to find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you but I'm in love with that tall dark man
So now I walk alone down by the river where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters for I can't live without Rosie Jones
Her lips were soft...

I think Ive stayed too long, but I aint glad to go
Back past the front door, theres someone sad and low
I climb into my office, I'm pulling away fast
Such a fool I forgot it, that drive could be my last
Driving far, on a distant road
Where we are, it's so hard to know
Say it for me, you'll be there for me
And you're gonna stay
When I'm days away
My comatose conscience, now it's clear and loud
Vince Gill on that radio, hes killing me now
If I could change the way I left, lord knows I would
I hate that not too long ago, I knew where I stood
Driving far, its a distant road
And where we are, sometimes I dont know
Say it for me, you'll be there for me
And you're gonna stay
When I'm days away
Im just days away

Every night before I go to sleep
I thank the lord down on my knees
For the bare necessities
Food, water, shelter, love
We're so busy judging right from wrong
Rich and poor, weak and strong
When all we need our whole life long
Is food, water, shelter, love
We can soldier on through each day
If we have a home to keep our family safe
And if your heart can be warmed by somebody's love
That's enough
People go hungry struggle to survive
While we fly New York to London in the blink of an eye
Why must it be so hard to provide
Food, water, shelter, love
We can soldier on through each day
If we have a home to keep our family safe
And if your heart can be warmed by somebody's love
That's enough
Every night before I go to sleep
I thank the lord down on my knees
For the bare necessities
Food, water, shelter, love
Food, water, shelter, love

I am a man of conviction, I shattered these walls
Spent my life in a bottle, cut myself had to crawl
Stared down a barrel of a 45, dared the man on the other side
To have the guts to pull the trigger
I am a man of conviction
CHORUS
Convicted of loving one girl too much
Sentenced to live without her touch
Convicted of somehow forgetting God
Sentenced to life of hell on earth
And they aint coming back, Ive never known either to lie
It wasnt my intention, I am a man of conviction
A promise made a promise broken, Ive left nothing uncertain
I took the lower road, my back bent to carry my load
I broke hearts along the way, made a fool of myself most days
It wasnt my intention, but I am a man of conviction
CHORUS x2
No dont you cry for me, Ive made this bed where I lie
It wasnt my intention, I am a man of conviction
Its too late for intervention, I am a man of conviction

The band just stopped playing
They're sweeping the floor
The bartender's asking
"Who wants one more?"
And your head's on my shoulder
And Lord, I'm feeling fine
Where are we going, honey?
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine
I really don't care
It doesn't matter
As long as we're somewhere
Now we both know I'll stay here
Right up 'til closing time
Where are we going?
Your place or mine?
Now we both came here again
For someone to touch
A living alone
Is sometimes a too much
Now, honey, I'm not pretending
A here's my bottom line
Where are we going?
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine
I really don't care
It doesn't matter
As long as we're somewhere
Oh, honey I'm not pretending
Here's my bottom line
Where are we going?
Your place or mine?
Where are we going?
Your place or mine?

[ Both ]
I remember when you said with this ring I Thee wed
Now you've gone betrayed my trust rings of gold have turned to rust
Tears can't wash away the sin love that's dead can't live again
Knowing there's no hope for us turns these rings of gold to rust
Plans we made just yesterday sands of time had chipped away
Now they've crumbled into dust rings of gold have turned to rust
[ guitar - steel ]
Love before was clean and pure never more can I be sure
You will not betray mu trust rings of gold have turned to rust

(with the Del McCoury Band)
Now that old car, it ain't gonna last
You ride around all day, I buy the gas
The more I work, the more you spend
Tell me honey baby when will this all end
Chorus:
Her bags are packed, my nerves are racked
She's got a one-way ticket, ain't comin' back
Oh baby, baby
Where you gonna find a good man like me
Take a look at this house turned upside-down
I hung the clothes on the line, they blowed down to the ground
I try to eat my own cookin' but its awful bland
I'm tellin' you right now things are out of hand

Mornin' comes, she wakes up fore it's light
And starts another day in hell
Tryin' to get her makeup right cause this time she can't tell 'em that she fell
He's sleepin' off another one so she tiptoes around
She don't make a sound
I don't know how she does it
One handed her a coffee cup
One to get the babies in the car
Cross your fingers, crank it up, hope and pray the piece of shit'll start
Singing with the radio so she don't fall apart
It's just a broken heart
I don't know how she does it
Finally into town the old familiar red light shining in her eyes
Rolls the window down and whispers, how you're gonna take back your life
She usually makes a right to work but turns it to the left
I think she might head west

Well you can find me servin' drinks inside a honky tonk
And I'll even play the jukebox on your dime
And sometimes I will dance with you to your favorite song
Yeah but she'll be mine after closin' time
She will smile at all the men and shake her pretty hips
And you can yell and say she look so fine
But I'm not looking for a man I'm looking for their tips
And then she'll be mine after closin' time
When they turn the lights out that's when I'll turn him on
Oh she can serve me love much better than wine
So when they close the doors I guess who takes me home
And she'll be mine after closin' time
[ guitar ]
Tomorrow night I'll still be there inside the honky tonk
And I'll still play the jukebox on your dime
Yeah as long as you keep buyin' drinks she'll smile and lead you on
But she'll be mine after closin' time
When they turn the lights out...
And she'll be mine after closin' time

He's rugged rough and ready his lady's soft and pretty
There must be ten years difference in their ages I suppose
But you don't see any traces or sadness in the faces
Cause together they're the cowboy and the rose
Now the lone cowboy shy like a piece of humble pie
Sips a cup of coffee at the dinner where he goes
Where he waits on the lady to finish waitin' on the tables
But together they're the cowboy and the rose
She's Better Homes and Gardens he's True West magazine
How they got together the good Lord only knows
But it's not for a man to question a love that's made in heaven
And together they're the cowboy and the rose
[ guitar ]
Well the lady keeps her distance there ain't much resistance
From the rednecks and the rounders drinkin' half cups for the road
Cause a man will meet his maker if he ever tried to take her
Or come between the cowboy and the rose
She's Better Homes and Gardens...
Cause together they're the cowboy and the rose

I often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
And there in the buffet car
I wait for eternity
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains till it gets light
The summer turns to winter overnight
The leaves fall so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock
Exactly what
I'm dreading
I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor
I'm waiting for
You baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby...

So you say you wanna tie the knot
And you're askin' me if I think that the two of you have got
What it takes to make it work
Well one thing's for sure
All you really need is love
Let me say I'm happy for you both
And here's a little something that the two of you should know
If you want to do it right
Just take my advice
All you really need is love
And a license and a blood test and a bunch of invitations
A minister, a white dress, and of course a congregation
And flowers and music and candles and cake
And a bunch of rice for folks to throw as you drive away
Now what's that expression on your face
You're lookin' kind of pale, is everything OK
Don't worry you'll be fine
If you just keep in mind
All you really need is love
And bridesmaids and groomsmen and a wedding coordinator
And food for the reception, you'll need someone to cater
Did I forget to mention it'll take a couple rings
And of course a P.A. system if you're wantin' me to sing
Now you look so happy you could cry
And that explains the tear drops I see wellin' in your eyes
Don't worry you'll be fine
If you just keep in mind
All you really need is love
I'm sure I'm tellin' you something you already knew
All you really need is love

Just outside of delta country
Where the bitter weeds growin' wild
Born seven miles outside of Woodland
Was a Chicasaw County child
An Poppa done brung us some peppermint candy
Momma fixed a custard pie
Bought her a store-bought doll from Jackson
She's a apple of everyone's eye
Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
Sporting her checkered feed sack dress
A ruby ring from a Cracker Jack box
Shufflin' on down that gravel road
Barefooted and chunking rocks
Momma said looky here dumplin'
You'll go far, cause you got style
Ain't nothing in this world gonna hold her back
Her pretty Chickasaw County child
Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
Leavin' the county a week from Monday
Ain't got much to pack
A tin can of black strap sogga molasses
And her momma's almanac
Momma done made her a brand new dress
Made of blue polka dotted silk
Two postcards from California
And a gallon of buttermilk
Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
You gonna be somebody someday
You gonna be somebody someday

Well its been a year and there so much to tell
Been doing alright in spite of myself
Just wish I could stop feeling bad when I pray
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
Got that job I was dreaming about
Sometimes its tough traveling around
But who I wanna be still seems so far away
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
glad I told you all I meant to
While I had the chance
Cause every moment I had with you
Made me who I am
by the way, I met someone new
And wouldn't you know, she's a whole lot like you
Still I ain't ready to settle down in one place
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
well I guess I'll be moving on
I'll just leave these daisies by your stone
And momma, I still miss you every day
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
when that'll be, guess only God can say
But I know I'm gonna get there someday

No answer to my letter
To soothe my aching heart
Oh, why did God ever permit
True love like ours to part
No letter in the mail today
No answer from my love
Nobody knows what I've been through
No one but God above
This is what I wrote to her
I know that I'm to blame
I know that I have broken your heart
And then I signed my name
No letter in the mail today
No answer from my love
Nobody knows what I've been through
No one but God above
I'm traveling down this road today
Yes, traveling my last time
If there's no letter in the box
I'm leaving this world behind
No letter in the mail today
No answer from my love
Nobody knows what I've been through
No one but God above

He was driving home one evening
In his beat-up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said 'I'm here to help you, ma'm
By the way, my name's Joe.'
She said 'I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.'
When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said 'How much do I owe you?'
Here's what he had to say
'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.'
Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
She must have been eight months
Along and dead on her feet
No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her
Change from a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a nakpin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she wrote
'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.'
That night when she got
Home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking about the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
'Everything's gonna be alright
I love you, Joe.'

Let's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair
Don't forget the lawn chair
Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war
I didn't, I'd seen it before
I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things
For a couple wings a little white dove
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want to
Everything before is gone or, going somewhere
I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things for a couple wings on a
Little white dove
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love
I don't know where we are
And I don't care
And now we're out of gas
And riding on air
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love
Let's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and its groovy
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want to

Honey, honey
Honey you still prey on my mind
I tried thumbin', a freight train jumpin'
Baby nothin' leaves you behind
So I jump up find me a mountain
Shake off the sheep I been countin'
Chase that sun 'til it runs out of sky
And if your memory's still too strong
I'll keep movin' on and get longer gone
Now there are those who
Swear that I belong in a padded room
'Cause I can't sleep, baby you keep
Creepin' up like the light of a crescent moon
So I jump up find me a mountain
Shake off the sheep I been countin'
Chase that sun 'til it runs out of sky
And if your memory's still too strong
I'll keep movin' on and get longer gone
It would be easy if I never loved you
I found someone new but until I do
I jump up find me a mountain
Shake of the sheep I been countin'
Chase that sun 'til it runs out of sky
And if your memory's still too strong
I'll keep movin' on and get longer
And get longer gone, longer gone
Honey, honey
Honey you still prey on my mind

If I could see you just one time
Oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time
And then pretend that you're still mine
[Chorus]
Oh, how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
[Chorus]
Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
[Chorus]

Summertime drivin' fast down an old back road
Feelin' fine you've got Skynard on the radio
The moon is bright me and my baby gonna break new ground
On a blanket in a field of green yeah that crickets sing a song to me
Yeah it goes
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
How about a night on the country
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It beats a night on the town
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Give me a night on the country
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause those city lights bring me down, yeah
Fire flies they burn better than candle light
Old bottled wine down in my hollow sings a lyllabye
You and me well that's just enough company
So baby listen to the night time breeze
You can hear it singin' through the trees
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
How about a night on the country
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It beats a night on the town
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Give me a night on the country
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause those city lights bring me down
Yeah baby listen to the night time breeze
You can hear it singin' through the the trees
It goes
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
How about a night on the country
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It beats a night on the town
(Wow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Give me a night on the country
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause those city lights bring me down
Give me a night on the country
I said a night on the country
A night on the country
Beats a night on the town, wow
The city lights bring me down

For all the times I felt cheated, I complained
You know how I love to complain
For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame
I still cursed that rain
I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue
Then out of the blue
God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life with just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt
All wrapped up in that hurt
For every glass I saw, I saw half empty
Now it overflows like a river through my soul
From every doubt I had, I'm finally free
And I truly believe
God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you
In your arms I'm someone new
With ever tender kiss from you
Oh must confess
I've been blessed
God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)
Now I do (I finally do), 'cause God gave me you (God gave me You)
God gave me you

Darling remember from when you come to me
That Im the pretender,
I?m not what I'm supposed to be
But who could know, lf I'm a traitor?
Times the revelator, revelator
They caught the katy, and left me a mule to ride
The fortune lady came along she walked beside,
But every word seemed to date her
Times the revelator, the revelator
Up in the morning up and on the ride.
I drive in to corning and all the spindles whine
And ever day is getting straighter
Times the revelator the revelator
Leaving the valley and fucking out of sight
I?ll go back to Cali where I can sleep out every night
And watch the waves and move the fader
Queen of fakes and Imitators
Times the revelator

I want to go all over the world
And start living free
I know that there's somebody who
Is waiting for me
I'll build a boat, steady and true
As soon as it's done
I'm going to sail along in the dreams
Of my dear someone
One little star, smiling tonight
Knows where you are
Stay, little star, steady and bright
To guide me afar
Blow, little wind, over the deep
For now I've begun
Hurry and take me straight into the arms
Of my dear someone
Hurry and take me straight into the arms
Of my dear someone

There's a road I know
Winding through the shade in my soul
There's a deep clear creek
The perfect place to watch a hook sink
Where I can breathe
What a crazy life
That's flying by
We only survive to get done
We all live and die on borrowed time
On a rock we ride around the sun
And I know, I know
All I ever want is to go slow
But I'm runnin' fast pace
Acting like I gotta go and win a race
What kind of sense does that make?
What a crazy life
That's flying by
We only survive to get done
We all live and die on borrowed time
On a rock we ride around the sun
'Cause sit on and think of that slow moving creek
And listen to wind in the trees
The sun on my shoulders
Sometimes that's all I need
What a crazy life
That's flying by
We only survive to get done
We all live and die on borrowed time
On a rock we ride around the sun
On a rock we ride around the sun

When you give yourself away
Love becomes somethin' that you do
Not just somethin' that you say
Ain't it funny how a smile
Makes the world a better place
When you give yourself away
When you open up your heart
You never know how it's gonna end
And that's the scary part
Walls are gonna tumble on down
Dam's gonna break
When you give yourself away
And reaching out for someone
Well, is all that we can do
You reach out for me babe
I'll reach out for you
When you look up to the sky
Feel like ya just don't belong
And wishin' you could fly
You find out you're not alone
And really all the same
When you give yourself away
When you give yourself away

Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
That ain't that I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Now at a game of chance the other night
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said "aces is full pal how about you?"
He said "I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
The other night I had a date with
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze
And she said "Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Just gotta have another cigarette

(I want you I need you I love you please grant me this)
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If you give me a chance to love you one more time
Maybe my lips on yours would change your mind
And you would know how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If there's a spark of love still left from our romance
You owed it to your heart to give me one more chance
Oh can't you see how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this

There's so many things we can do this Christmas
Just once I wanna go on a ride in a one horse sleigh
Go caroling down the street while everybody listens
Singing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, jingling all the way
And if snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love who miss us
Call up the neighbors and open up a bottle of cheer
Umm, there's so many we things can do this Christmas
Ha ha, join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Oh, yeah
And if it snows just a little too much and there ain't no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love, who miss us
Call up the neighbors and open up a bottle of cheer
There's so many we things can do this Christmas
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year

Thank you baby for teaching me the world is really round
There's more to it than my two eyes can see
Thank you baby for showing me that black is sometimes grey
And the alphabet is more than ABC
Thanks for explaining that there are things the best left unexplain
But thanks for tryin' hard to answer all my questions just the same
Thanks for thinking that much of me
But most of all baby thanks for tryin' so hard to love me
Thank you baby for never promising thanks you couldn't give
For never lie just make yourself look good
Thank you baby for never pushing me down the path I shouldn't go
And with all my fate and trust you know you could
Thanks for opening my eyes things I couldn't know
Wrapped in my, for I had all those seeds to grow
Thanks for thinking that much of me
But most of all baby thanks for tryin' so hard to love me
Thank you baby I wanna thank you baby

Stay away from me, you're causing me trouble
It's been that way, since from the start
Go on your way, you have another waiting
Stay away from me, you're breaking my heart
Oh the sky is blue, and the sun is shinning
And autumn leaves have turned to brown
I loved you so, but I can't have you
Stay away from me, stay out of town
Oh the sky is blue, and the sun is shinning
And autumn leaves have turned to brown
I loved you so, but I can't have you
Stay away from me, stay out of town
Stay away from me, stay out of town

There's an oil well down on Johnson's road
Where we'd go to be alone
I never thought i'd go there by myself
I stood there calling out your name
No one answered just the same
The silence speaks for itself
Well, I've been high and I've been low
And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, lord, I don't know
I guess the silence speaks for itself
The last time you talked to me
I did all the talkin' now I see
You were telling me there was someone else
What i'd give to hear your voice
But i'm not given any choice
'cause the silence speaks for itself
Well, I've been high and I've been low
And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, lord, I don't know
I guess the silence speaks for itself
The last time you talked to me
I did all the talkin' now I see
You were telling me there was someone else
What i'd give to hear your voice
But i'm not given any choice
'cause the silence speaks for itself
I guess the silence...

Wish I had a car, top rolled down, the music up loud
Follow that girl all over town and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
Wish I had a dog, seen her in the park with a puppy on a string
Looking so cute maybe sooner or later we'd meet
Norma Jean Riley's gonna talk to me
Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
Oughta learn to dance, with the hottest moves and the latest styles
Get her on the dance floor and after awhile you'll see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna dance with me
Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
Gonna write a song, sing about her hair, her lips and her eyes
Bring her to tears with my heartfelt honesty
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me
Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me
Everybody says fool, fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna marry me

I just got back from Hell
And I'm satnding here alive
I know it's really hard to tell
Don't know how I survived
But I can't say that I'm doin' great
But I think I'm doin' well
That Devil's gonna have to wait
'Cause I just got back from Hell
Well, I just got back from Hell
And I guess to tell the truth
Well, I've been mad at everyone, including God and you
When you can't find no one to blame you just blame yourself
And I know I'll never be the same
I just got back from Hell
Forgive me if I had any part
If Iever broke your heart in two
Forgive me for what I didn't know
For what I didn't say or do
And, God, forgive me as well
'Cause I just got back from Hell
Well, I just got back from Hell
And I need to make some plans
It's the last thing that I wanna do
But I'll do the best I can
I'm gonna learn to live again
But I think I'll sit a spell
Tell the world that I'm alive
And I just got back from Hell

Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night I can't keep from crying
You met someone that was new
You quit someone that you knew was true
Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night blue as I can be
I don't know what'll become of me
Where we used to walk I walk alone
With an aching heart because my love is gone
Blue night blue as I can be
Blue night 'cause I'm all alone
I used to call you on the telephone
I used to call and it made you glad
Now I call and it makes you mad
Blue night 'cause I'm all alone
Blue night all by myself
Since you put me on that shelf
There's just one thing that you must know
You're gonna reap just what you sow
Blue night, all by myself
Blue night, all by myself

Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own
Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
And the truth be known
That I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you 'cause I know that
I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose
And I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you
Like good times of which
I've known many
And I love you
'cause I know you give me
A heart of my own
You make my blood flow
Like red on a rose

I tried my hand at the game enough
But I ain't lucky when it comes to love
I want it all but I never want to wait
You ain't like the ones I've known before
You stir up feelings that I can't ignore
This heart of mine finally understands
And baby, I've been held and I've been tied down
I've been wrapped and I've been unwound
I've been kissed oh
But I ain't never been loved
Till I Was Loved By You
Now people told me that I was wrong
But I knew love was a sweeter song
I kept waiting for the perfect melody
Now in your arms it's plain as day
Knowing you was worth the wait
Come say you'll never give up on me
(Repeat Chorus twice)
Till I Was Loved By You
Till I Was Loved By You
Till I Was Loved By You

you didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me...

Got any plans for the weekend
Cause I've got an idea
Lets do something we ain't done in a couple years
Lets roll out on the highway and we'll wave the world goodbye
Well come on baby how bout we just drive
Just drive and get away
Just drive and run away
Cause I love you right beside me
And the way it makes me feel
When I've got one hand on your leg
And one hand on the wheel
And we just drive
Well pack a bag with some simple things
Cause you won't need much
Just a pair of faded jeans
I love it when you wear that stuff
You can let you hair down
We can loose all track of time
Come on baby how bout we just drive
Let's just disappear together
And leave it all behind

Sittin' in the bed of my truck
Barefoot and cuddled up
Sippin' sweet tea in the settin' sun
It's so hot outside, her hair's untied and all undone
Johnson Hill overlooks the fence
To the only drive-in, left from here to Lincoln county
A little statics alright with us
Yeah, it's Friday night, how we unwind and get all undone
Tune our dial to 1650
A Coleman lantern and hot dogs grillin'
Ain't no one up here but a few bull frogs
Yeah, our idea of getting crazy has a lot
To do with just getting lazy
On a patch quilted blanket
We'll put the brakes on the rush
Yeah, it's Friday at night time
To unwind and get all undone
Fog settin' in, the air is so thick
Nights like these it's good to be wet
So we might go dippin' in Miller's pond
Yes, we might turn the headlights off
Leave the radio on and get all undone
Tune our dial to 1650
A Coleman lantern and hot dogs grillin'
Ain't no one up here but a few bull frogs
Yeah, our idea of getting crazy has a lot
To do with just getting lazy
On a patch quilted blanket
We'll put the brakes on the rush
Yeah, it's Friday at night time
To unwind and get all undone
Yeah, it's Friday night
Time to unwind and get all undone

[Chorus]
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly
Common man of men and the King of many
He'd lay his hands on his brother man, save us all from the sinnin'
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly
If He was here today I bet He'd drive a Chevrolet
Workin' at the plant drawin' workers pay
He'd preach in some little country church outside of the city
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly
[Chorus]
His long hair and sandled feet would be in style
Surround himself with the good old boys to tell His tale
He'd have a mighty cross tattoo on his hands by the nail holes that killed Him
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly
[Chorus]
Some folks would say it wasn't really Him
You know they'd probably send Him off to some kind of loony bin
They wouldn't hang Him on the cross but they'd find some way to condemn Him
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly
[Chorus]
Yeah, He'd be a Hillbilly,
I'd bet Jesus be a Hillbilly, Lord, you know He'd be a hillbilly.
(Yeah, hillbilly, if Jesus walked the world today).

Troubles and trials
Often betray us
Tempting the wearing
Body to stray
But we shall all meet
'Side the still waters
With the Good Shepherd
Leading the way
Those who have strayed were
Sought by the Master
He who once gave His
Life for the sheep
Out on the mountain
Now He is searching
Bringing them in
Forever to keep
Going up home to
Live in green pastures
Where we shall live and
Die nevermore
Even the Lord will
Be in that number
When we shall reach that
Heavenly Shore
We will not heed the
Voice of the stranger
For he would lead us
On to despair
Following on with
Jesus our Savior
We shall all reach that
Country so fair

I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I"ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Load the car and write the note.
Grab your bag and grab your coat.
Tell the ones that need to know.
We are headed north.
One foot in and one foot back.
But it don't pay to live like that.
So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks.
For never to return.
Ah Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in.
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands they shake, my head it spins.
Ah Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in.
When at first I learned to speak.
I used all my words to fight.
With him and her and you and me.
Ah, but it's just a waste of time.
Yeah it's such a waste of time.
That woman she's got eyes that shine.
Like a pair of stolen polished dimes.
She asked to dance I said it's fine.
I'll see you in the morning time.
Ah Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in.
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands they shake, my head it spins.
Ah Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in.
Three words that became hard to say.
I and love and you.
What you were then I am today.
Look at the things I do.
Ah Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in.
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands they shake, my head it spins.
Ah Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in.
Dumbed down and numbed by time and age.
Your dreams that catch the world the cage.
The highway sets the traveler's stage.
All exits look the same.
Three words that became hard to say.
I and love and you.
I and love and you.
I and love and you.

Baby brought me in out off the highway
Poured my right good liquor down the sink
Straightened out my crooked ways of thinking
And made it purely pleasure when I drank
And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine
Baby's up and running in the mornin'
Says she's got a million things to do yeah
While I'm gone just you go get your guitar
Write some pretty song about me and you
And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine
Baby says she'd really love a party
Get some friends together feelin' fine yeah
Any friend of mine is worth his habit
A belly full of baby's Bluebird wine
And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine
Yes it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird, wine

(Spoken)
Hand me that balloon right there
Boy I used to love to do this when I was a kid
Watch this Hey watch this girl
Plowboy, ain't that funny, plowboy
(Sounds of a horse going neigh)
(Sung)
Well I'm a packing up my truck and I' m a head down south
Where real men packa lips with dips in their mouth
Start a moonshine steal sleep in a tent
buy some cheap livestock find some land to rent
Then I'm a Cledus T. it up and down the farm
With a couple of barns a baby calf in my arms
You know I hate to brag but I'll be tilling the most
Run a barbwire fence from post to post
Keep shells in my gun, Deer heads on my walls
Live out in the sticks and wear overalls
why because I want to
Find me a home in a cow town baby Where the buffalo roam
read the farmers almanac for all the right reasons
Make sure my crop is the top of next season
Cledus T. is a farming freakazoid
Yeah I'm heading down south sucka
Because I want to be a plowboy baby
(With my upraised hat on my john deer tractor)
Plowboy baby
(Redman pouch for the chewing tobaccer)
Plowboy baby
(Sleeping at night cause I work all day)
Plowboy baby
(You can smell my pigs from a mile away)
I bet you'll hear my rooster crowing when the day begins
He goes..
(Sounds of a rooster crowing)
In lust for a hen
Home schooling, home fries, good homemade wine
Well harvest the fields
(But not before its time)
Plant peas, and beans, green beans and rice
Haul manure from the barn to fertilize
And if the price is right I'm gonna sell my hay boy
And let G-E-O-are-G-I-A know why they calling me the Plowboy baby
(With my truck locked down in a four wheel drive)
Plowboy baby

Plowboy baby
(Sleeping at night and bushhoging all day)
Plowboy baby
(Thank god for Willie Nelson and Farm Aid)
YEAH... Cledus T. you can call me a hick
The only woman for me is a Dixie Chick
I got two billy goats week 'fore last
Till my snapper gets fixed They'll be cuttin' my grass
Back hoeing, scare crowing, shoeing my horse
You know a horse is a horse
(Of Course, Of Course)
Screws up the spread gotta make it look right
I gonna paint my barn red and paint my fence white UH!
Find dayus, calm and toe tomatoes
Irrigate some ground for my sweet potatoes
Drink wine makers, storm like Quakers
Got no love for you vegetable haters
How I'm gonna buy my seed
Sell my soul to the seed and feed
My dog is green just like my hay bail
Ain't no chickens in my yard keep em all in my trailer
Dog named old yeller cut through a stick
I'd slop my hog but I
(Already feed it)
I'm picking off ticks, scratching poison oak
But I keep on sucking thanks to calamine lotion
(Plowboy)
got a 4230 with my diesal whining
(Plowboy)
spend all my time on a big combine
(plowboy)
Praying at night it'll rain some day
(Plowboy)
You can smell my pigs from a mile away
(Plowboy)
Got my crop laid out and the sunshine shining
(Plowboy)
Got an old tin steel with my moonshine shining
(Plowboy)
You can smell my swine

Yeah he's a good drinkin buddy,
He always shows,
All my complainin ain't no skin off his nose,
He always makes me happy and never sad.
He's got a golden tan,
Seems to me like my kinda man,
He never picks a fight or makes me mad.
My new boyfriend comes in a bottle,
Always makes me feel like a model,
Seems to make me forget all about you,
He's a real good listener, a pick me up,
We ride around for hours in my truck,
He always understands what I'm going through,
Took a shot through the heart with cupid's arrow,
Gonna fix it with a shot of Jose Cuervo...
Yeah he's the best, that money can buy,
You even get to pick your size,
Wipes away those pesky memories,
You can take him everywhere in your purse,
He'll come shopping and with ya to work,
Who ever said the best things in life are free?
My new boyfriend comes in a bottle,
Always makes me feel like a model,
Seems to make me forget all about us,
So when some jerk that's at the bar,
Tries to take me to his car,
He makes me a little tough,
Usually I find it hard to say no,
Gonna fix that with a shot of Jose Cuervo...
Yeah he likes all the songs I like,
Always lets me be right,
Never turns away from my touch,
You can bring him home to bed,
Never elbows you in the head,
Well, not unless I've had a little too much.
My new boyfriend comes in a bottle,
Always makes me feel like a model,
Seems to make me forget all about you,
He's a real good listener, a pick me up,
Yeah he always gives a... hoot,
He always understands what I'm going through,
Got shot through the heart with Cupids arrow,
Gonna fix it with a shot, or two, or three, of Jose Cuervo :)

You haven't said it
But I've seen the words in your eyes
Coming like heavy black clouds
To clear summer skies
You go thru the motions
Of given your heart
I don't feel a thing
Cause were so Far apart
And its all over
It's all over but the crying
I believe there's nothing I can do
The Heart to changes sweetness over you
Your warmth has gone and your smile is alive
You found so many ways of saying GOOD BYE
You haven't said it
But I've read the signs in your face
No mention of leaving
But everything carry's its trace
I spend each moment
Preparing myself for the pain
And the loneliness back on my shelf
Cause Its all over its all but the crying
Its all over but I've seen it coming on
Its all over the love we had is gone
It's all over but the final farewell
Will be your way of turning my heaven to hell

'Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or a gloomy day
'Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
'Tis sweet to be remembered, remembered, remembered
'Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away
As I travel on this world just to soothe my rovin' mind
And the messages I get from a dear one left behind
They were filled with sweetest words that's so touch me when I heard
Never never can I forget these are some things that she said
'Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or a gloomy day
'Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
'Tis sweet to be remembered, remembered, remembered
'Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away

I grew up in a town where tough was a cigarette
And a souped up car on a county road
Nothin' much to do back then so we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
I learned to hold my own
Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday Bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
That there was more to life than that so I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
I didn't come here to die
Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy 'till I got home
Daddy, he'd say, "Listen son", but back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know
I reckon I was doing close to 80
When I felt the tire slip out from underneath
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me
And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smokin' gas in my eyes
And He said, "Son, you came here to live
You didn't come here to die"
Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
I met a girl in town, put some money down
On a little house with a yard
Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was sittin' there at his side
Sayin', "Son open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes
'Cause you came here to live
You didn't come here to die
Son, you came here to live"

Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
And you say you're going away
Leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
I've hurt me enough today you can't believe a word that I say
But you must accept the fact I won't be coming back
Oh but stay stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today

Our manager called said, 'We need to talk'
So I met him on the eighteenth floor
He said, 'Daryle, we need to change a couple of things
'Cause country ain't country no more'
We need a little more glitz and a little more glamor
A few fireworks and some half naked dancers
I said, 'Okay, that's fine with me
The only problem I see'
I still sing this way, the only way I know
Straight from the heart, a little through my nose
You can dress me up in leather pants
Put me in front of a rock 'n' roll band
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way
I've had this Georgia Twain in my thing ever since I was a kid
There's a whole lotta Haggard Jones in my bones
What you hear is what you get
You can turn down the fiddle and steel guitar
Try to market me like a big pop star
I'm afraid it'll all go south when I open my mouth
I still sing this way, the only way I know
Straight from the heart, a little through my nose
You can dress me up in leather pants
Put me in front of a rock 'n' roll band
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way
When it comes full circle and the fads die down
Hardcore country comes back around
I'll be waiting with a big ol' smile
Because I'll be back in style
I still sing this way, the only way I know
Straight from the heart, a little through my nose
You can dress me up in leather pants
Put me in front of a rock 'n' roll band
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way

Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
Well, I've been working in this factory
Pretty close to 15 years
I've seen some of my best friends women
Drownin' in a pool of tears
I've seen a lot of kinfolks dyin'
I had a lot of bills to pay
Lord, I'd give the shirt right often my back
If I had the guts to say, say what?
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman's done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
The foreman is a regular S.O.B.
And the night boss, he's a fool
He got himself a brand new flattop haircut
Lord, he really thinks that's cool
One of these days I'm gonna blow my top
And that's shockin', he's gonna pay it
Well I can't wait to see their faces
When I get the nerve to say, say what?
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
Take this job and shove it

She's still the angel that I knew before the only difference now is she's mine
In an apron or a nightgown or the wedding dress she wore
She's a perfect angel all the time
You know it's funny how when you first meet a girl
And start likin' her you always see her at her best
All made up her hair just right dressed nicely
And you just assume she's like that 24 hours a day
Then when you get married it's face-cream and body-pins and hair-rollers at night
Makeup eyelashes hairspray in the mornin'
Soapsuds floorwax and bacon grease through the day
And then you stop and think about it
And she's really goin' through all the stuff just for you
And knowin' that makes her all the more beautiful
She's still the angel...

I'd be lyin' if I said, I never prayed for this
I can show you here and now, how much love you've missed
I'm happy that you're sad, I know that sounds so wrong
But darlin' you must know the pains gone on too long
Come in out of the pain, let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Lay down in my arms there ain't no shame
Now don't just stand there girl, come in out of the pain
Well I know how, a heartache feels shattered when it breaks
And if you believe in me, he'll be your last mistake
I can't stop the wind and I can't stop the rain
But I can promise you that I can stop your pain
Come in out of the pain and let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Oh lay down in my arms, there ain't no shame
But don't just stand there girl, come in out of the pain

We don't smoke marijuana in Tuskegee
We don't take our trips on L.S.D.
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
We like living right and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
We like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Ol' Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Ol' Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.A.

Around the rim on Cottonwood
There stands a cedar shack
And a pole corral to pen a bronc
And a shed to hang your khack
Beneath the peak of lodgepoles
Between an aspen stand
Behind the crest of cedars
That stretch the broken land
Between the sage and the timber
Where cattle often hide
Where I ride to each December to curl up inside
And look up at the windy peaks
And feel the fire's glow
Then trot out through the morning
'Cross the dusted winter snow
Around the rim on Cottonwood
A brand new lion track
That dots a line up through the draw
And slowly circles back
Where somewhere in the bitter night
He drifted like a spirit
Beyond the realm of vision
Not I nor horse could hear it
But yet the proof that there he crept
Cut fresh into the snow
And still I shiver at the thought
Of where and why he goes
Around the rim on Cottonwood
Where deep the canyon cuts
Into the mountain's very bowels
Its twisted winding guts
The frozen rivers down below
And warm springs on the hill
At minus seventeen and more
The water's running still
And running deep are shadows now
For day does not stay long
Soon the full moon rises high
And I can hear the song of one lonely coyote
Singing farewell to the sun
Sending out the call that finally evening time has come
Around the rim on Cottonwood
My fire's burning down
My cabin warm
My ride was good
My sleep is sweet and sound

This town, she is a temptress
A siren with gold eyes,
She'll cut you with her kindness,
She will lead you with her lies
She's been called a glistening devil,
She's good at keeping score
If you make it she's your savior
If you don't she's a whore
The roads to and from her heart are littered with grave souls.
They gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes.
Sure we've all heard about Shell, and Chris, Willy, and Bobby Bares.
She'd smiled on Johnny's the Merles any music-wrote billionaires.
Like a beacon she goes seeking seed, her loins so fertile.
To a free man she's a prison, to a caged one she's a fire.
She's the reason there's a Sunday morning coming down.
I saw the light, a boy named Sue,
He stopped loving her today. The pill and 16th avenue.
The rhyming, oh she's a diamond the brown eyed mickey
She was Roy Acuff castle and Elvis parsley's broken dream
Its not all bad its not all dark its not all gloom and crass,
But to mine gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass.
For she's seem 'em come and seen 'em go, and came herself a time or two.
No matter how satisfied her scream sounds she always wants someone new.
The next him or them or her or all to the rest of them all
Be a star in this lady's town you can fuck or you can fight.
You see, it all comes down to money.
Not romantic art of days gone past, if you forget that rule,
You can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass.
A tramp, a slut, a bitch, a mutt, a thousand pawn shop guitars.
A nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart.
She lurks in friendly shadows, but she's a junky with a limb.
The agents are her bookie and the labels are her pen
I'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide
The devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride
All the chaos he has caused, and done
His greatest tribute to every guitar-toting' dreamer
The devil don't but me, i shook his hand
And i know that he is real, so devil, you can go screw yourself
And then go straight the hell.

Hold on a minute it ain't time to leave
Tell me how you're feeling one more time
Four long years and I just can't believe
That I'm still yours and you're still mine
While I was gone, yes, I fell in love
Asked around and heard that you did too
Two drunken years and push came to shove
I met love, love left me blue
You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
And I'm all right, yeah, I think I'm fine
My savior lives in telephones
And I just dream of you and step outside
Dial up and hope that you're home
You're rising like a sun
That waits up all night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
Hold on a minute, yeah, I do love you
Sometimes I guess that ain't enough
When I came round again you put me through
And I thank you, oh, so much
Another year, maybe, three or four
Maybe five or six or even more
You'll find another man to take my place
And I'll see you on the good Lord's shores
You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life

I shaved my face and combed my hair,
Put on a new pair of underwear
And sat on the porch with my Labrador
Like a hundred other times before
She changed her shoes and freshened up her face,
Put on some skimpy sexy lace
And finally made her way through the back screen door,
We loaded up on the front seat of my Ford
[Chorus]
And we went out to dinner and we drove right back home,
Watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
Then we turned off the tv and we got right down to it,
There ain't nothin' left to do now that we've done it
Oh, yeah
It seems like it happens every time,
We get a chance to reignite that fire
We burn it fast and then retire
Just before the news on channel five
[Chorus]
After all these years it can get routine,
You can change the order up, or use different names
Try it in the mornin' or the middle of the day,
The end result's still the same
[Chorus]
Oh, Lord, we've turned off the t.v.
And we got right down to it,
And there ain't nothin' left to do now that we've done it
Hey, honey, hand me that remote.

Except for you
I've never known what love is
Or how it feels, to have a dream come true
But now I find my world no longer lonely
And the way that it would be, except for you
One by one
You mended all the pieces
of a heart that someone broke in two
You filled my life with happiness and sunshine
That i never would have known
Except for you
You brought all the rainbow colours to a world of solid blues
And nothing prettier than rainbows, except for you
And so my love, I wanted just to tell you
This old heart wont beat again
This old heart wont beat again
This old heart wont beat again
Except you

In this picture you're right beside me
Arms around my neck and eyes like you'll never leave
A love lover, a sweet thing
I know we agreed, but I think I'll call you anyway.
Well hello, It's just me
A little distance and I lost something in between
I've waited forever
For this to get better.
She said how can I believe in something I can't see or feel with my fingers?
Yeah how can I believe
And I said...
Anytime you think you wanna be my love
That's a reason to do what you're thinkin of
Anytime you think you wanna come on over
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
Well hold on take it slowly
Breathing deep and MEANING EVERY WORD JUST FOR YOU
only
Keep this inside you no matter what you do
These are the simple things in loving, yeah
The simple things in loving, yeah.
She said How can I believe in something
When you're never here and I'm not sure if I need this?
How can I believe?
And I said...
Anytime you think you wanna be my love
That's a reason to do what you're thinkin of
Anytime you think you wanna come on over
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
She said How can I believe in something
I can't see or feel with my fingers?
Yeah how can I believe?
And I said...
Anytime you think you wanna be my love
That's a reason to do what you're thinkin of
Anytime you think you wanna come on over
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
Stop asking, get in the car and drive
Get in the car and drive.

I got a letter from your lawyer
And you got one from mine
They say It's gonna be final
Once we sign that dotted line
We'll I guess we'll get our freedom
And a so called fresh new start
But when you take half of everything
You'll be taking half my heart
Our love got lost somewhere in life's complications
Torn between two lawyers and all their legal litigations
Chorus:
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
I took down our wedding picture
From above the fireplace
And I stood there awhile
Starring at your pretty face
Have we lost our love
To differences we can't resolve
But if push comes to shove
Thank God no children are involved
I can still see you throwing your rose bouquet
I never thought I'd see the day we'd throw it all away
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
Bridge:
I've done all I can do now all I can do is pray
And ask the Lord to let me hear you say
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
Girl, off the record, I'm still in love with you

Can I depend on your light pretty moon while I'm holding her tight silver moon
Will you be there above helping me win my love
And I depend on your light Mr Moon
Every time you're shining there's romance in the air
Reset her heart to pineing and tell her I'll be there
As I look in her eyes pretty moon will you look from the sky silver moon
If I ask her who'll be mine will you stand by me
Will you help me tonight Mr Moon
If we're wed in the middle of June will you shine bright for our honeymoon
When you shine you make love seems to come from above
Will I see you tonight Mr Moon
It seems your gold and beauty just makes a perfect night
Somehow it seems my cuty looks cuter by your light
There'll be just us three pretty moon you and her her and me silver moon
For helping our romance I'll thank you in advance
And I'll see you tonight Mr Moon

If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A tear may appear when I hold you near but that's for the sweet things you do
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
By your side I will stay till we're old and gray reminiscing the moments we knew
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A thief couldn't steal the joy that I feel heaven for me has come true
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
Oh by your side I will stay

Oh, such a stranger, you don't even know me
It's just as though we've never even met
Oh, such a stranger, you don't even see me
Tell me, was I that easy to forget?
Don't you remember? Please, won't you try?
Was it that long ago you brought tears to my eyes?
Oh, such a stranger, we're not even friends
Don't you even remember me when?
Was it that long ago

If somebody would've told me
One woman could hold me
And leave me weak as a baby
I'd have told 'em they were crazy
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
I used to play it so cool
Lord knows that I was no fool
No chains would ever bind me
But those days are all behind me-
you see
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
I never saw love's power
Just the hearts and the flowers
When I fell it was frightening
It struck me down like lightning-
when
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
I used to live like a rolling stone
Nobody had a hold on me
All it took was a kiss from you
To bring me right to my knees
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
Yeah, that's all she wrote

Ballad Of Jed Clampett - Bill Monroe
Come and listen to my story 'bout a man named Jed
Poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed
Then one day he was shootin' at some food
And up through the ground came a bubbling crude
(Oil, that is, Texas tea, black gold)
First thing you know, old Jed's a millionaire
Friends said, Jed, move away from here
Said that California was the place he ought to be
So he loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(Hills, that is, swimming pools and movie stars)
Well, now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You're all invited back again to this locality
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
(Beverly Hillbillies, that's what they call 'em now
Nice folks, Y'all come back now, hear?)

Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
It's not the first time I've found myself alone and known
If I really had you once, then I'd have you when I'm gone
Whistle blows, blowin' lonesome in my mind
Calling me along that never ending metal line
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
Sun is shining, through the open boxcar door
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before
I've lost count of the hours, days, and nights
The rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back

(Porter Wagoner & Frank Dycus)
Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?

(Move a little farther along)
You've been followin' me with your painted blue eyes
Since I walked in this bar and sat down
Just because my sweet baby is not by my side
Don't mean that I'm slipping around
So move a little farther along find somebody who is too weak to be strong
Check faces down the line stop looking at mine move a little farther along
Just because I've been by here a few times and stopped
Don't mean my heart's breaking in two
Even though I played sad songs on that old jukebox
There's no reason to think I need you
So move a little farther along
Move a little farther along

Friends, my name is Ferlin Husky.
I'd like to tell you 'bout a man that let alcohol
destroy everything that God gave him
I saw an accident one day that would chill the heart of any man
It would teach them not to drink a drop
While the steering wheel's in their hand
This awful accident occurred on the 20th day of May
And caused two little children to be sleepin' beneath the clay
These two little kids walked side by side along the state highway
Their poor old mother, she had died
And their daddy had ran away
As these two little children walked arm in arm
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curb came a speeding car
With a drunk man at the wheel
The drunk man saw the little kids
And he hollered a drunked sound
"Get out of the road you little fools"
And the car, it brought them down
The bumper struck the little girl, takin' her life away
While the little boy, in a puddle of blood
In the ditch, lyin' there did lay
The drunk man staggered from his car
To see the damage that he had done
And then he let out a yell you could hear for miles
When he recognized his dyin' son
Such mournin' from a drunken man, I've never heard before
While kneeling down by his car he prayed to heavens door
Sayin', "Oh God, please forgive me for this awful crime I've done"
And his attention then was called away
By the words of his dyin' son
He said, "Daddy, why did you do this to us
How come you run us to the ground?
It was you and Mummy we were talkin' about,
When the car, it brought us down
And I was just tellin' little sister
That I knew we'd see you again someday
But, Daddy, why did it have to be this way
Why did it

HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
(Miriam Eddy aka Jessi Colter
How do you tell someone you don't care how do you say I don't love you
Win the heart that you're tellin' is so good and true and loves no one but you
And how could my heart be made of stone oh why must this be
I'm unable to give my love to one who gave her life for me
And how could my heart be made of stone...

Well I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to
They pass quicker like when I was a child
[Chorus]
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time
[Chorus]

Nothing but love will ever heal your torn up heart
Nothing but love can fix the worn out, broke, lost, empty, part
No 'cause nothing but love is strong enough
To make you forget what you won't believe
If nothing but love was all there was
Then nothing but love is there for you and me
Nothing but love and just love will leave
Nothing but love for you and me
Yeah yeah yeah
Nothing but love is there when the rest is gone
Nothing but love is left after each regret moves on
No 'cause nothing but love stays long enough
To forgive every last sad memory

It ain't nothin' but a small frame house on an acre lot
It ain't that much diff'rent from any other house on the block
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
But at least one thing's for sure, I got it honest
Roll out of the sack every mornin', head on down to the mill
Give 'em all I got for eight, 'cause that's the deal
If you'll check out my paycheck
Well, you'll see that there ain't that much on it
But ev'ry single penny I'm paid, I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause buddy if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest
Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And I might seem like some kind of low-life
To that highfalutin' crowd
But I'm plain spoken, straight talkin'
And damn proud of what I have accomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
But, I got it honest
Now when I die, I may not leave my kids a fortune
But I hope they know'd my life stood for things that were important
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause brother if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest
Friend there ain't no doubt about it, I got it honest

Would you believe this blacktop highway
Used to be a one-lane gravel road?
Back when Johnny Cash was just somebody
Daddy went to school with years ago
When the cottonwoods reached to the sky
An' honeysuckle vine grew all around
My eyes well up with memories
Every time I think about this little ol' town
'Cause I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
But everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas
I used to laugh at all the stories
Daddy'd tell me 'bout the mischief he'd get in
Dream of penny-candy an' nickel soda-pops
Lord, what a dollar'd buy back then
When livin' life was picture perfect
Like a Norman Rockwell paintin' of the South
Lord, I'd give almost anything
To hear my Daddy tell the stories now
He'd say, "I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
Still, everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas"

The world is cold but I don't care
When you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound
And good things happen when you're around
I work hard for not much pay
So I can know you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds
And good things happen when you're around
So won't you wait for me
I'll be home soon
Wait for me
I'll only be a day or two
The world is cold but I don't care
When you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound,
Good things happen when you're around
Good things happen when you're around.

You stole his love and left behind dear a broken heart a worried mind
Your new found love will turn to hate dear and you'll be left alone to pine
Stolen love can't last forever stealing leads to a life of sin
You stole his love from another your stolen love I know someday will end
You'll walk in shadows branded forever you and you alone will bear the shame
Stolen love can't last forever with stolen love you play a losing game
Stolen love can't last forever

I'm gonna be a modern day drifter
And get out while I can
Gonna trade in this life I've been living
For a pocket full of sand
And a modern day drifter don't have to tell no one his plans
I'm gonna find that long stretch of highway
No one knows my name
Where as long as the sky just goes on
And it's never the same
A modern day drifter don't ever complain
Bye bye hi life
Feels like the right time
To say so long
Keep on going strong
And I'll just keep on being gone
Cause I'm gonna be a modern day drifter, Yes I am
Gonna slip this ring off my finger
Cause everybody understands
That a modern day drifter's got nothing but time on his hands
Bye bye hi life
Feels like the right time
To say so long
Keep on going strong
And I'll just keep on being gone
Cause I'm gonna be a modern day drifter
Oh yes I am
Gonna slip this ring off my finger
Cause everybody understands
That a modern day drifter's got nothing but time on his hands

36, 32, boot cut with a skoal ring
Grease stains, bleach spots and a hole in the knee
You say the man inside those Levi's don't take orders
And she'll just have to realize you'll do as you damn well please
You wear the pants, buddy good for you
I'm so impressed, yeah whoopty-doo
You need to know that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants, it's who wears the skirt
In the top drawer of her dresser there's some panties
Go try on that purple pair with the lacy frill
With your big old thighs I bet you can't get in 'em
And with that attitude of yours, hell I bet you never will
You wear the pants, buddy good for you
I'm so impressed, yeah whoopty-doo
You need to know that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants, it's who wears the skirt
A big old boy like you can probably bench 350
A little thing like her can barely lift the bar
But just wait until that woman has a headache
And she sits there with her legs crossed we'll see how strong you are
You wear the pants, buddy good for you
We're so impressed, whoopty-doo
You'll soon find out that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants, it's who wears the skirt
You wear the pants, she'll wear the skirt

Bad angel, get off of my shoulder
Bad angel, let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
I woke up bound and determined
That I would not light it up today
But one drag would stop my shakin'
Right now I could go either way
Bad angel, get off of my shoulder now
Bad angel, let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
Well the cap is on the bottle
And the bottle is on the shelf
Should I take it or leave it?
Honey, how am I gonna help myself?
Bad angel, get off of my shoulder (get on off of my shoulder)
Bad angel, let me be (oh let me be)
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
That's right,
Well I know I should not gamble
'Cause I can't afford to lose
She'd hang me from the rafters
Put the laces in my old working shoes
Oh, bad angel, get off of my should (get on off of my shoulder)
Bad angel, let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
Yes I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation
Temptation and Salvation
Temptation and Salvation Street
(Oh yeah)
Yeah, ha ha ha ha

(Dolly Parton)
I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you
Gave you every bit of my time
Gave you everything I could possibly give you
My body, my heart, and my mind
I turned my family and good friends against me
Listened to my own heart break
And I did it all in the name of love
Gave up myself for your sake
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
Over and over again
You promised to love me forever
But forever reached a bitter sweet end
Been blinded by love to your actions
But at last I can see my way clear
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried
But you, you've never shed one tear
'Cause you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears
Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I ain't hangin' 'round here
You've left me crying, left me crying for years
But you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You never cared about me
You only hurt and decieve
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
No you ain't worth the salt in my tears

Got a country girl
With a country twang
She's a ridin in a little country thing
Baby blue jeans
Little mood ring
I can't wait to find out what that purple means
And she's a popin off the top of that sweet cherry chapstick
Hummin to the radio
We're lookin for a place if we can make a little magic
Green light take a ride dirt road
Here we go
I feel like the whole wide world is shining down on me
Right off a county road seven with a little piece of heaven
Her eyes and the sky just as blue as can be
Feelin kinda crazy
I'm just chillin with my baby on a saturday afternoon
Man I'm thinking maybe that I finally found my lady
And I think she feels the same way too
Oh ya
Hit the quick sack
Grab the six pack
And when we get there I can't wait to have a sip of that
And she'll be lookin so good
There sittin on that hood
My little kiss and tell bombshell aw hell
And it feels like the whole wide world is shining down on me
Right off a county road seven with a little piece of heaven
Her eyes and the sky just as blue as could be
Feelin kinda crazy
I'm just chillin with my baby on a saturday afternoon
Man I'm thinking maybe that I finally found my lady
And I think she feels the same way too
Oh ya
And it feels like the whole wide world is shining down on me
Right off a county road seven with a little piece of heaven
Her eyes and the sky just as blue as could be

Well I've been wonderin' what I've been missin' I guess I should have known
But my heart does and it ain't whisperin' it tells me just what it wants
Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
And the shape of my ol' hat
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that
Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
So I keep patchin' that ol' flat
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
Yeah, I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that
Two young people dancin' in the daylight
They don't care where they're at
Waitin' sunset holdin' on so tight
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
One little baby hidin in the shadow
Of her daddy's hat
Lovin' and trustin' blindly she'll follow
I need a love like that
[Chorus]
Yeah, a truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that

I guess you're off to have your fun
Another ending just begun
And I know what I don't see
Really shouldn't bother me
So go and have yourself a ball
You'll be at no one's beck and call
And with that fire in your eyes
Another lover's moon will rise
And someone else will take the fall
And that's just the way you are, I've known all along
Some candles always burn even when the night is gone
But the strongest of flames won't burn eternally
When you find another friend who'll light your candle up again
You can burn one down for me
So you don't matter anymore
I'll convince myself, I'm sure
As if I give a damn
That's just the way I am
So go on and pour yourself some wine
With who'll ever spend your time
'Cause anyone can see you won't be crying over me
And you never were that kind
And that's just the way you are, I've known all along
Some candles always burn even when the night is gone
But the strongest of flames won't burn eternally
When you find another friend who'll light your candle up again
You can burn one down for me
When you find another friend who'll light your candle up again
You can burn one down for me

You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
He only had a dollar to live on ?till next Monday
But he spent it all on comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?
Someone should call his parents or a sister or a brother
And they'll come and take him back home on a bus
But he?ll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
And he?ll always be another one of us
He said he wanted heaven but prayin? was too slow
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low
You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low
Dyin? slow, blinded by snow

When we dance together my world's in disguise it's a fairyland tale that come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you
My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone the moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and on
And I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas

I've built a million raving beauties out of pure make-believe
Hopin my imagination might run away with me
Thought I'd pictured every vision that a man could dream about
Till you walked through those swinging doors
And stepped down off that cloud
what's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
A walkin, talkin, lovin fantasy
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
what's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
I thought I'd died and went to heaven when you sat down next to me
Lord, and I said to myself this is too good to believe
You look like you belong in a Sunday school choir
Instead of in this honky tonk settin me on fire
what's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
A walkin, talkin, lovin fantasy
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me
what's an angel like you doing in my wildest dreams
Are you just wishful thinkin, a figment of my mind
I'll worry about that tomorrow, right now it's closing time

We're tied to our memories, they won't let us stray
We're not gonna lose ones we made yesterday
We look to our future and we make all our plans
As if we control what is out of our hands
The world keeps on turning I'm learning to see
Right where I am is where I have to be
You can't count the pages, all ages hear the call
No matter how hard we try life gets away from us all
We start getting older the moment we live
Look over your shoulder there's hindsight to give
Come good days and bad days the sun's gonna rise
So why look beyond what's in front of your eyes
The world keeps on turning I'm learning to see
Right where I am is where I have to be
You can't count the pages, all ages hear the call
No matter how hard we try life gets away from us all

Came home to a house
Where everything was emptied
They took my T.V. and my chair
They even found her jewelry
And the police say there's nothing they can do
'Cause it happens everyday
Before I fell asleep when she was cryin'
This is all I could say
What in the world is this world coming to
Can't have a damn thing nice, no use to try to
What is one man feelin' helpless supposed to do
What is in the world is this world comin' to
Come home to a house
Where everything was emptied
She left my T.V. and my chair
Now I', lost in memories
And my friends tell me there's nothing they can do
'Cause it happens everyday
And as I fell asleep that night cryin'
This is all I could say
What in the world is this world coming to
Can't have a damn thing nice, no use to try to
What is one man feelin' helpless supposed to do
What is in the world is this world comin' to

Old heart of clay why do you let her mold you this way
She'll try to shape your life and make me over don't you see
Old heart of clay why do you let her change you this way
The things she'll do to remake you will surely ruinin' me
Everytime I turn around there she is pushing you
And everytime I put her down she cries and says we're through
Old heart of clay don't let her take my lonely soul away
Oh don't you see we must be free both you and me
[ steel ]
Everytime I turn around...

I'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Don't look at me like you think I've got the blues
'Cause I'm walking 'round and around and I'm seeing most of the town
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Ah ha so I'm talking to myself
Oh no she's not putting me on the shelf
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
I'm doggone if I'm gonna cry the blues
My feet are sore but I've got no time to lose
'Cause I'm wanting her here with me and I'm needing her company
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes

You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
And expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad
We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself
Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky and rude
You're selfish, conceited and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta dodge
Cause you don't know love from shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm hearted shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love
From shinola
Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about
Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from shinola
I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from shinola

When I was a young boy evening sun went down
Stand off by the railroad tracks
And I'd listen for the sound
Of that Kansas City Southern man
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was outward bound
Well I'd dream about big cities
And the pleasures I would keep
Long about twelve-thirty through phase of my sleep
I'd hear that Kansas City Southern man
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was outward bound
Well now I've been in a couple of places
Seen a couple of things
Whenever I think back in time
My memory rings
With that Kansas City Southern man
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was homeward bound
Don't you know how the whistles blows

He swore it was over
And all in his past
A few hours later
His hand's 'round a glass
A voice on the left says,
"There's peace in the wine"
From the right a voice whispers,
"Don't do it this time"
When he looks for the answer
Down in his heart
Demons and angels
Tear him apart
She calls his name softly
As she lies in their bed
Listens for footsteps
And prays for the best
She knows that he loves her
Knows that he tries
But if he comes home drinking
She'll leave him tonight
She waits for the answer and
Cries in the dark
While demons and angels
Tear him apart
For so long they've fought for his soul
The whiskey and the woman at home
And they all know he must choose
The winner alone
There's not much that's sweeter
Than a new life begun
Ain't much that's sadder
Than a promise undone
He stares at the bottle,
Longs for her arms
While demons and angels
Tear him apart
When he looks for the answer
Down in his heart
There's demons and angels
That tear him apart

You might think it's a one- horse town
No traffic lights, one roundabout
Beccy runs the corner shop
Shuts the door at five o'clock
You might think this town is dead
'Cause we ain't got no drive through yet
Our one garage don't open nights
Truckies they just roll on by
But down the road at The Grand Hotel
Saturday nights are as hot as hell
The band plays, cold beer flows
Stomp the floor and dance 'till close
Comes alive when the sun goes down
Country boys and girls get loud
Billy Rigg he owns The Grand
He's filled the fridge, he's booked the band
Six o'clock he preps the troops
Eight o'clock all hell breaks loose

He's got a US flag on his front porch to remind everyone where he lives
And up in the attic there are papers that prove the old house is finally his
After thirty five years the grass still don't grow in that rock hard west Texas ground
Where my old dad still clings to that old coyote town
Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name
Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
Waist high weeds hide a forsale sign at the drive-in where my innocence died
With a rusty advertisement dangling by a nail says popcorn and pepsi for a dime
And down at the depot where I left for good
There's a hobo and his three legged hound
Waitin' for a train that no longer comes to that old coyote town
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
Daddy falls asleep in the living room on the sofa with the TV on
Sometimes he waits for a phone call from me sometimes he waits too long
But I still think of people and the place that he loves
How much longer will they be around
'Til it's aches to aches dust to dust for that old coyote town
Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name
Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
God bless that old coyote town

In your haste you left and said you'd be returning
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
Every minute hopin' I'll look up and you'll come walkin' in
[Chorus:]
For then and only then will I stop crying
And this aching breaking heart of mind will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me
Will I be happy and I live for then and only then
All that's left inside my heart is just an echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
Repeat [Chorus:]

Through trials, troubles and care
I know Jesus my savior is there
Giving me faith through darkest days
Keeping me on the narrow way
Jesus savior, help me each day
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior, help me to stand
Jesus lived through darkest pain
Rejected by men, despising the shame
Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief
He gave His life so we may be free
Jesus savior, help me each day
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior, help me to stand
I know that Jesus died for me
Canceled my debt at Calvary
Rose from the dead, unlocked Heaven's door
Trust in His love and live evermore
Jesus savior, help me each day
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior, help me to stand

When all your loves have ended
When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone
Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
How many fools would have you
I know one
This fool keeps wondering
Why he fell in love at all
But you might need this fool
Around in case you fall
After the party's over
And you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you
I know one
You never know, you might be lonely
When all your loves have missed
It wouldn't hurt to keep
An extra fool on your list
After your heart's been broken
And it needs a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you
I know one
Yes, I know one
I know one

The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbin' back behind the wheel
Fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
Sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me where I like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pullin' ribbons from your hair
And your kiss
Girl, that's what I miss
Still I drive these horses
Through the rain and snow
This high speed rodeo's all I know
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

We all are fellow travelers
Sailing across the universe
Living aboard the good ship earth
We all are fellow travelers
My heart keeps hoping that someday
Some way we'll rise above
Look from the moon at the world below
And somehow know, with love
That we are fellow travelers
Sailing across the universe
Living aboard the good ship earth
We are all fellow travelers
And if we must journey together
Forever it's plain to see
How we'll depend on each other
Through all eternity
We are all fellow travelers
Sailing across the universe
Living aboard the good ship earth
We all are fellow travelers
Children singing:
We are all fellow travelers
Sailing across the universe
Living aboard the good ship earth
We are all fellow travelers

Tell her, tell her what Im thinkin
Tell her, tell her what Im dreamin
And, hey, she just might just understand
Baby would you listen to me
Come across the kitchen to me
And I will tell ya best I can
Bout how I know you love me
And how I want to love you back
People, people, people, they make it sound so easy
They say just do what your heart tells you to
But sometimes you cannot feel it
Sometimes you cannot hear it
Sometimes it wont talk back to you
And yeah I know you love me
And yeah I want to love you back
And how I know you love me
And how I want to love you bad
Far away I hear the rhythm of a song
Far away I get the feeling I belong, and so do you
And it goes like this
Oh no, no, dont want to leave you
Oh no, I want to keep you
Oh but I want to let you be
Oh no, I dont want to hear you
Say I dont want to be near you
Oh but Ive got to set you free
And how I know you love me
And how I want to love you back
And yeah I know you love me
And yeah I want to love you bad
Far away I hear the rhythm of a song
Far away I get the feeling I belong, and so do you
And it goes like this
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Here's the story of a dying man
Told by a friend of mine.
He said that he heard it from a friend of his
Who was a real close friend one time.
One night he chose to choke his wife
Until the light that was there turned cold.
He'd heard some stories 'bout her
From a friend of a friend I'm told.
The continental drift. The continental drift.
Why do you say "no"
When what you mean is "yes"?
Why do you say "never mind"
When it's obvious that you dooooooo?
Yeah, I love you too.
When it's obvious that you dooooooo.
Yeah, I love you too.
Let's hang around and watch
This good man lose his goodness
And leave a trail of misery behind.
I heard he chose to choke his life until the light in it went cold.
I heard it from a friend of a very good friend of mine.

(sidney cox/the sidney lawrence company,bmi)
Lost in the silence
Surrounded by daydreams
Holding that someone that's holding my heart
Thrilled with the memory
Of the smile that you gave me
Gives a close feeling
Though we're far apart
The longest highway runs between us
Though you're just a heartbeat away
When I think of you, my heart knows no difference
I've got you with me every day
If I could be anywhere
I'd truly be with you
Then once feel the embrace of your hand in mine
The longest highway
Can sure seem forever
Through every daydream
I feel closer each time

They ask me, how we do it'
And I tell them, we love each other
There's really nothing to it
It's easy, we love each other so
And we always will, and I know
We found it long ago, and now, it's sure
That it's the kind to last forever
They ask me, can we make it'
And I tell them, we love each other
If there's trouble, can we take it'
And I tell them, we love each other
More than we ever have before
And they should know
When they ask us, how we do it

Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night

I'm 500 miles away from home
Teardrops fell on momma's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm 500 miles away from home
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home,
But it sure looks different now. And I guess I look
Different too, cause time changes everything. I wonder what
They'll say, when they see their boy looking this bad.
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate
It's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still 500 miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm 500 miles away from home
Away from home away from home
Oh I'm still 500 miles away from home

My nights have been lonely since I've been in Tulsa County
And I really don't know what I'm gonna do
Guess that I'll just mosey down around that southern border
Cause I feel I gotta get away from you
I got your note in Charleston that you needed my assistance
But when I came out you didn't need me then
Though I may not be your wise man but I know the life I'm a living
And you got your help from lots of other men
I don't know just where I'll go guess I'll ride on down to Mexico down to Mexico
You say that you love me like your feeling got you sorry
But you gotta lie to keep this fool around
And if I'd stay I know that I'll just be around to laugh at
Since there's nothing else to keep me in your town
I don't know just where I'll go guess I'll ride on down to Mexico down to Mexico
I don't know just where I'll go guess I'll ride on down to Mexico down to Mexico

Summertime is past and gone and I'm on my way back home
To see the only one I ever loved
Now the moon is shining bright, it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh, I know she waits for me, back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright, it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh, I know she waits for me back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright, it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved

Sheriff come in the pool hall
With that look on his face
Have you seen Jack Blue around this place
He's a bad one him always breakin the law
If you see Jack Blue better give me a call
Jacks shooting pool on a Friday night
Couple out of town boys lookin for a fight
It was 2 on 1 but Jack evened the score
Paramedics packed one of em out the door
CHORUS
Well you dont go lookin for trouble
Aint that what the old folks say
Dont go lookin, dont go lookin for trouble
Itll find you. anyway
57 stitches in that boys hide
Doc shook his head said your lucky your alive
Dont go lookin for Jack Blue
Heres some thread and a needle in case you do
CHORUS
Well you dont go lookin for trouble
Aint that what the old folks say
Dont go lookin, dont go lookin for trouble
Itll find you. anyway
Jack works in his yard and he drinks ice tea
He aint had a fight since 93
Dont go to bar rooms or billiard halls
Tries to teach his boys to respect the law
CHORUS
Say you dont go lookin for trouble
Aint that what the old folks say
Dont go lookin, dont go lookin for trouble
Itll find you. anyway
Itll find you anyway
Itll find you anyway

Your love was a summer breeze that blew my mind and doesn't mean
And left my heart clinging desperately to a special memory
So special memory come walk with me through the fields of used to be
Where dreams can be reality and once again each you and me special memory
Your love was a summer storm no sound to hear then it was gone
And now sweet sadness lingers on and live my whole life long
So special memory...

He's a dangerous man
He's got blood in his plans
Better watch out where you stand
'Cause he's a dangerous man
He'll make you believe that he's your friend
But don't forget it's just pretend
And he's a dangerous man
He'll tell you the right things
About all the wrong people
He'll smile and he'll say "Hey you and me
We think just the same"
You better make sure that you read
All the rules first
'Cause he runs a crooked game
He's a dangerous man
He's got blood in his plans
Better watch out where you stand
'Cause he's a dangerous man
He'll make you believe that he's your friend
But don't forget it's just pretend
And he's a dangerous man
His words are all vain
And his promise is empty
His message is loud
But it ain't meant to be clear
He hides all the clues
That have left his hands stained and dirty
And he'll wash them with your tears

Before you tell me how loud I can play my music
Before you tell me the way I should raise my keys
Before you try to tell me what to say
You might wanna think about it, yeah
Before you turn my family farming to a strip mow
Before you move another factory overseas
Before you go giving my job away
You might want to think about it, yeah
Think about this land that we live in
Of the rights we've been given
And people who die to make us free
Maybe you should stop thinking about the fight you've been picking
And the butt-kicking you'll get from me
You might want to think about it, yeah
Before you try to take away my ten commandments
Before you try to tell me when and where to play
Before you go messing with my fate
You might want to think about it, yeah
Think about the choice that you're making
And the stance that you're taking
Before you come rolling down my street
Maybe you should stop thinking about the fight you've been picking
And the butt-kicking you'll get from me
The eyes whipping you'll get from me
Before you go and try to take away my freedom
Before you go and try to take my voice away
Before you go and make a big mistake
You might wanna think about it
You might wanna think about
You might want to
You might want to
You might wanna think about it

Don't expect a twirl
She's not that kind of girl
She reserves the right to be sullen
In a purple mood
Yeah she still thinks it's cool
So don't even try to tell her nothin'
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool
She can feel your stare
And knows you're standing there
Waiting for a chance to win her favor
But she just sips her wine
As you get in line
With all of the others trying to save her
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool
I know it's hard to resist
The taste of her kiss
But remember this
She won't let down her guard no matter what you do
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool

I should get the purple heart for loving you after all the pain you put me through
When they start passing medals out to fools I will get the purple heart for loving you
There was nothing in the headlines to day you won the war
The one and only casually was me
You put me out of action so many times before
And left me on this battlefield to bleed
And I should get the purple heart...
[ steel ]
No one knows that I'm a hero there's no medals on my chest
All my wounds are hidden deep inside
I volunteered to love you hoping for the best
But all you ever done was cheat and lie
I should get the purple heart...
I should get the purple heart...

Now who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes
Or the bitter direction of impending good-byes
I've followed and folded, i'm wilted in place
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face
With your heart broke and running from the reason
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?
With my heart broke
Now pride is a drag and a bore when you're lonely
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to you
But all is not lost, it's only mistaken
That's small consolation but i know just how you feel
With your heart broke and running from the reason
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me
Heart broke , who kept me from leaving?
With my heart broke
Nobody said it was going to be easy
We all have feelings that need a softer touch
But nobody said that it would not be worth it
The human condition continues as such
With your heart broke and running from the reason
You've got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?
With my heart broke, youõve got me heart broke

[C.W. clears his throat.]
Roy. By C.W. McCall.
[The only musical instrument heard is the plucking of a Jew's harp.]
I had an old cat named Roy.
He was a good ol' boy.
He used to go a-huntin', down by the lake,
Catch 'im a nice, fresh garter snake.
Bring 'im on back and then set in the grass,
Lookin' like he had 'im a green mustache.
Yeah, Roy was a good ol' boy.
'Til the dogs got 'im.

Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
You justify yourself in your love for someone else
When you say, I never loved you anyway
Your vows were made in vain, although my love still remains
Though you broke my heart in two, who can blame you
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed
'Til the day she was asking you to stay
You turned your head from the tears I've shed
Though you broke a heart in two, who can blame you
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you

From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting

She told me she love me, she told me a lie
She said I'd be happy then she made me cry
Well, I'm hurtin', hurtin' inside
She called me a baby in front of these guys
She was just flirtin' I wasn't wise
Now I'm hurtin', hurtin' inside
Tell me what's wrong in me?
What makes me live in memory?
Someday she'll be sorry just to wait and see
Someone's a gonna hurt like she hurt me
Then she'll be hurtin', hurtin' inside
Tell me what's wrong in me?
What makes me live in memory?
Someday she'll be sorry just to wait and see
Someone's a gonna hurt like she hurt me
Then she'll be hurtin', hurtin' inside

I no longer notice if you're wearing perfume I quit smoking girl you never even knew
And the road is full of young and restless people and they pull off the energy to move
It's the habit for us to stay together we said and watched the nightly shadows grow
Every day last year I left for California this is my year for Mexico
We used to whisper low across the night time now we never whisper nor we call
Our love was left upon the shelf from winter where the sunlight never touches it at all
It's the habit for us...
Your back is turned to me while you are reading
I close my eyes while I pretend to toe
From the road I hear the sound of passing traffic some of them are bound for Mexico
It's the habit for us...
This is my year for Mexico

There's a place I go where love grows wild
Forever seems to go for miles
Even when it rains, the sun is shining
Dark woods always in full bloom
On my tip toes I can touch the moon
I'm out of ? clouds with silver lining
It's like no place on earth
It's bluer skies and greener grass
A little off the beaten path
I see your smile and I hear your laugh
And I'm lost in a world
Where colors shine in brighter shades
My favorite song is always playin'
The center of my universe
Planet her
It's the ocean when the sun comes up
Or when those candy sweets that brush
It's honey suckle wines and chocolate candy
It's a shot gun ride on angels wings
Waking up in a perfect dream
It's anytime and all the time when she's around me
I'm in a brand new world
With bluer skies and greener grass
A little off the beaten path
I see your smile and I hear your laugh
And I'm lost in a world
Where colors shine in brighter shades
My favorite song is always playin'
The center of my universe
Planet her
It shines like a star
It's a ?
It's anywhere we are
It's bluer skies and greener grass
A little off the beaten path
I see your smile and I hear your laugh
And I'm lost in a world
Where colors shine in brighter shades
My favorite song is always playin'
The center of my universe
Planet her

Moody River more deadly than the vainest knife
Moody River your muddy water took my baby's life
Last Saturday evening I came to the old oak tree
That stands beside the river where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found with a note addressed to me
It read dear love I've done you wrong now I must set you free
No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend
[ piano ]
Moody River more deadly...
I looked into the muddy water and what could I see
I saw a lonely lonely face just looking back at me
Tears in his eyes and the prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love at his fingertips
[ piano ]
Moody River more deadly...

There must be something fishy going on
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey
I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on

Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages let his praises ring;
Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.
[Refrain:]
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
Listening every moment to the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior as my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God.

Takes a summer time in dollars at minimum wage
To buy some Pittsburg steel when you come of age and
Even more to get it running and shinning like you did
It was two tone tar heel blue and white
Couple kinwood speakers tuned just right
Crazy how a car makes a king out of a kid
It was sun down ready, hardtop heavy,
Shotgun girlfriend primed.
Just some teenage no fear,
Half bald good years that still turned on a dime
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride in that bronco
Momma still puts flowers out by your grave
Daddy pulls against Ford in Sunday's race
And Leah has a hard time thinking she's older than you
And me I still see you backing out in reverse
The headlights bright behind your hurst
If I only could fix things like someone I once knew
I wouldn't be sitting tangled mangled full of county junk yard pain
All busted rusted out here cussing crying out your name
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride in that bronco
It was a hell of a ride
It was a hell of a ride
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride
It was small town high hopes
Why it ended there only heaven knows
A brother a hero and a hell of a ride in that bronco
It was a hell of a ride
Takes a lifetime of prayers on bend and knee
To try to come to peace with your memory

Been together four years and had five kids
So we did the right thing and finally got hitched
We tracked down the preacher after altar call
And proceeded to the VFW Hall
When he said, Cledus T. did you take Debra Liz
I stuttered, I do, knowin' I done did
The wedding cake was, 'Moon Pie', stacked three tiers
And the punch bowl flowed with Falstaff Beer
Now that's about as swanky as this town gets
For they throw rice, heck, they threw grits
No stretch limousine, just a full sized van
But at least we was headed for the promised land
On our hillbilly honeymoon
No champagne Caviar or Cordon Bleu
A can of Vienna Sausage and a Mountain Dew
And soda pop too
On our hillbilly honeymoon
Spent all our money on pay per view
Didn't need Playboy to get in the mood
Just a roller derby wrestlin' and a Rambo II
And III and IV, I was up in the room
On our hillbilly honeymoon
Well, after a while things simmered down
So we got dressed up for a night on the town
There ain't nothing too good for my sweetheart
Took a romantic stroll through the Super WalMart
We got back wanting some fine cuisine
We bought out the whole dern vending machine
On our hillbilly honeymoon
No dainty little plates of finger foods
Just M&M;'s Snickers and tomato juice
And Cheez Wiz too
On our hillbilly honeymoon
I spent half our savings on the hardware aisle
She spent the rest on the latest styles
A thong underwear that drove me wild
Back in the room, I tried them on too
On our hillbilly honeymoon
Well, it's been three years, got four more young'uns
Ain't a lot of time for much kissin' and a huggin'
For the last eight weeks I've slept on the couch
Think it's about time we renewed our vows
And took another hillbilly honeymoon
No [Incomprehensible] egg nog, just barbecue
And a box of wine will be nice down too
Won't need a corkscrew, yeah
On our hillbilly honeymoon
We can raid little Tommy's piggy bank
Scrape up a hundred dollars worth in change
Just enough for a night at the bowling lanes
And some new perfume, cheap motel room
On our hillbilly honeymoon
[Incomprehensible]

In spite of everything around me
I hit the floor and my feet kept moving
I looked forwards and never backwards
I was out the door like a rollin' soldier
Impossible to keep a straight line
Too young to keep these bitter hearts
And all around me, somebody's singin'
Get back, get back
And long hair comin' down her shoulders
She is tired and feeling so much older
So tear the pages from the family bible
It came down upon the women for survival
It came down upon the women for survival
And I wasn't meanin' nothing at all
You stop me if I get it wrong
I think I'm hearin' somebody sayin'
I'm gonna spank ya till you can't sit down
Burst apart, ah, we lose each other
The constellation of my sisters and brothers
Are spreading all out into the darkness
Goodbye to you in the sadness of this
Goodbye to you in the sadness of this
Goodbye to you in the sadness of this
Impossible to keep a straight line
Too young to keep these bitter hearts
And all around me, somebody's singin'
Get back, get back

Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know
She's the best thing in this life
Why she worships the ground that he walks on
She waits up for him at night and worries
Until he's safely home
And she always believes his stories about working overtime
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind
Aw but it crossed his
Early last summer
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave in
And now he wishes he could stop himself
But theres no easy way
So he lays down with his lover
And silently he prays
Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know
In his heart and soul
He knew he was playing a game he could never win
But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now he's givin up on lookin for a way
To fight the feeling
So he prays this simple pray
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling
Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

I lit my love and watched it burn:
Asking nothing in return.
Except the lessons I will learn.
From holding crazy faith.
I've been touched by that bright fire.
Down to the root of my desire,
While the smoke, it rises higher.
Glowing crazy faith.
You're not asking if I love this man.
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:
It tells me.
Am I a fool for hanging long?
Would I be a fool for being long gone.
When is daylight gonna dawn,
On my crazy faith.
The questions will not let me sleep,
The dance is buried way too deep.
But the bottom lover, lover's keep,
Made by crazy faith.
You're not asking if I love this man.
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:
It tells me.
Love you're losin', those you love,
Let the hope fly from the glove.
Do not search the skies above.
Search your crazy faith.
Love is lightning, love is ice.
It only strikes the lucky twice.
Once or you will know the price.
And once for crazy faith.
You're not asking if I love this man.
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so.

I went downtown thought I had a dime
Got home this morning didn't have a dime
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin' I got the dog house blues
Come home this morning about half past eight
She said honey you're out too late
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin' I got the dog house blues
I went in the house to start the fire
She kicked me out in the middle of the night
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin' I got the dog house blues
I fell in the yard mad as I can be
Said to my dog make room for me
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin' I got the dog house blues

She's got a way of makin' me feel strong
A style and grace that's all her own
She's got a way of makin' me feel like a man
Every time she takes my hand
The clouds roll back
All my troubles disappear
Every time that she draws me near
She's like a cool drink of water
Every time she touches my skin
Like a warm ray of sunshine
When she whispers that she loves me and lets me in
She looks at me and I wind up on my knees
She takes my heart and don't give it back
Yeah I love it when she does that
She's got a smile that makes men weak
Brother, that's what happened to me
And she's got a voice that moves me like a song
And I could listen to it all night long
Yeah, she ain't perfect
And she don't pretend to be
But everything's that's wrong with her is perfect for me
She's like a cool drink of water
Every time she touches my skin
Like a warm ray of sunshine
When she whispers that she loves me and lets me in
She looks at me and I wind up on my knees
She takes my heart and don't give it back
Yeah I love it when she does that
And like the stars at night
Oh that girl's my guiding light
And I'll stay by her side for the rest of my life
And take a cool drink of water
Every time she touches my skin
Like a warm ray of sunshine
When she whispers that she loves me and lets me in
She looks at me and I wind up on my knees
She takes my heart and don't give it back
Yeah I love it when she does that

Take me in your arms and hold me
Like I've been holding you in my heart
Take me in your arms and tell me
That you've missed me since we've been apart
You just don't know how heartsick
And lonesome I've been
Or how much I've prayed
That you'll come back again
And take me in your arms and hold me
Like I've been holding you in my heart
You just don't know how heartsick
And lonesome I've been
Or how much I've prayed
That you'll come back again

Tonight do me a favor
On your way to do me wrong
Drop me at a honky tonk
Don't leave me here alone
I washed and waxed the car today
I even filled the tank
If you're gonna drive me crazy
Drive me to drink
All the mothers and your lovers
Will be happy I suppose
You'll be in his arms again
And I'll be off the road
The highway will be safer
And they'll have you to thank
If you're gonna drive me crazy, baby
Drive me to drink
You're in the driver's seat
It's all up to you
I'll be your dedicated man
Or your designated fool
But if you're hell-bent
And bound to bolt
I can't change the way you think
If you're gonna drive me crazy, baby
Drive me to drink
You're in the driver's seat
It's all up to you
I'll be your dedicated man
Or your designated fool
But if you're hell-bent
And bound to bolt
I can't change the way you think
If you're gonna drive me crazy, baby
Drive me to drink
Well if you're gonna drive me crazy, baby
Drive me to drink

I catch myself still loving you
I walk down these streets every night about this time
'Cause you're in my heart and on my mind
I can't face the fact that we are through I catch myself still loving you
I catch myself a crying as I walk along
Memories are my company since you've been gone
Someone else now holds you like I used to do I catch myself still loving you
I catch myself a crying

As past times go I guess I've seen some good
It's not always the best ones come and stay
There's a crowd that thinks there is one and it should
'Cause they seem to spend theirs the same old way
And they call it winding down
The six to ten crowd, smoky bars
Notes on napkins and business cards
Describe the days events and go on home
And it's likely they won't drown
The price goes up and one more round
They close up all the bars downtown
As the singer plays one last rip roaring song
It seems like the same old motions every night
He wants to hear a golden oldie to take him back
And I'll play out all the emotions I can't fight
Relieve the tensions and hope they're on the right track
And they call it winding down
The six to ten crowd, smoky bars
Notes on napkins and business cards
Describe the days events and go on home
And it's likely they won't drown
The price goes up and one more round
They close up all the bars downtown
As the singer plays one last rip roaring song
Honky tonk heroes are turn the page
And the books are closed tonight
'Cause everybody knows you gotta leave 'em up
So they'll go home feeling right
You gotta leave 'em up
So they'll go home feeling right

Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
My mind was young until she grew
My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real
To be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew
Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her
It just doesn't know she's gone
Ooh, but I remember everything she said
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes

No chocolate in the duty free shop
Two drops of scotch
Gonna end up on his crotch, tonight
All alone, sitting on the throne
Some native tongue on the TV
Blaring like an old Peavey
He don't aim to be rude
He's fighting with his inner prude
Some pommes frites and you know
It's gonna drip on to his lap
Yes, see the man slapping it off
Travellin' will do him in
Trudging through the waves of people
'till his heart is cluttered and feeble
If you take him out of this loop
He may be very easily duped
Still he beats the stampede for the duty free

(Dolly Parton)
We can't always both be right
We sometimes disagree
But you've got the right to speak your mind
An' it's the same with me
When the anger's at an end
And you want inside my arms again
All you have to do to make it right is just
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright
There are times when I should be strong
When I'm awfully weak
When the sudden blows of life have brought me to my knees
Woman needs a helpin' hand
Needs someone to understand
Needs the man she loves to help her stand, so
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright
And when the busy day is done
You lay by my side
You know exactly what it takes to keep me satisfied
You know exactly what I need and I always go to sleep in peace
Thanking God that you belong to me, so
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

Oh Daisy Mae my honey oh Daisy Mae
When I'm with you my darling all my cares go away
Oh don't you know sweetheart that I love you so
Cause you're my darling precious Daisy Mae
So nice and neat with kisses so very sweet
In my opinion darling you just can't be beat
And now I found you no one else will ever do
I'm tryin' make you happy Daisy Mae
Oh Daisy Mae my honey...
[ guitar ]
You're everything you're every song that I sing
Your lovely little hand looks lovely with that ring
It won't be long until you'll hear our weddin' song
And you'll be mine all mine Daisy May
Oh Daisy Mae my honey...

This road that I've chosen it's a road that few have traveled
But there's good times with the hard times along the way
And this life that I'm livin' God knows that I love it
And I like to share it with you if I may
So I write my songs of life as I know it
And I sing them for everyone to hear
And in my songs I hope you understand just a little
What it's like to be a rodeo man

She's every reason I take so much work on
And every reason I take so much time at home
And every single reason why I'm so much stronger
And every reason I could never be alone
Look at me, you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her, you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me, she's half the man I am
When the rivers all run dry, she finds the water
And when everything is dark, she finds the light
And when it's time to fly, she's flying with me
With her on the wing, we balance out just right
Look at me, you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her, you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me, she's half the man I am
I'm what she's made of me, she's half the man I am

No if, and's, but's or maybe's
So you wanna be her baby
I can read your face like a book
Yeah it looks easy to love her but believe me brother
It's harder than it looks
She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart, yea
Yeah she's good when she's bad
She's cute when she's mad
And she does all the wrong things right
Yeah boy it's a fact when they're made like that
You ain't ever gonna sleep at night
She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart
Once you feel her touch and you've felt that rush
It's gonna mess up your head
But here's the kicker son
Your old ticker's gonna beat you half to death
She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart
Yeah she's hell on the heart

Well before she came along he was lonesome onry and mean
It was his way or the high way
But she had a way that hed never seen
Hed been livin hard and fast
All his takin was takin its toll
And it took a good hearted, hard headed angel
To help him gain control
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldnt see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Except for Jessie
Well she never tried to change him
But she loved him and gave him a son
And that aint easy with a honky tonkin man
Makin music on the run
And Lord knows she was a good wife
Always good at findin ways to right his wrongs
She was the love of his life, the inspiration for his songs
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldnt see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Except for Jessie
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldnt see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Except for Jessie

She weren't much to look at, she weren't much to ride
She was missing a window on her passenger side
The floorboard was patched up with paper and tar
But I really was something in my old yellow car
An American boy with his hands on the wheel
Of a dream that was made of American steel
Though the seats had the smell of a nickel cigar
I really was something in my old yellow car
Somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel
Thee's a rusty old shell of an automobile
And if engines could run on desire alone
That old yellow car would be driving me home
There's the seat where poor Billy threw up in his date
And where Larry and Sally could no longer wait
There was no road too winding and nowhere too far
With two bucks of gas and my old yellow car
Somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel
Thee's a rusty old shell of an automobile
And if engines could run on desire alone
That old yellow car would be driving me home
Take a look at me now throwing money around
I'm paying somebody to drive me downtown
Got a Mercedes Benz with a TV and bar
And God I wish I was driving my old yellow car
God I wish I was driving my old yellow car

(Dolly Parton)
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
Something badly needed to lighten up the chores
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell
In the water being used to scrub the floors
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home
She believed in lots of work with little play
And we laughed till we bent double
Though we knew we'd get in trouble
But trouble's all we had at evening shade
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
To teach you love and keep you off the streets
And all the kids that live there are said to be a problem
Juvenile delinquents so to speak
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
An iron hand has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
The reason we were there is 'cause we had no one who cared
But they cared even less at evening shade
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this
And so I started talking plans with the older kids
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene
And I would get some matches when nobody seen
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
Now that its all over and the sun is going down
There's no evening shade because we burned it to the ground
Evening Shade was burning just like the hell it was

Well I ain't the type of cowboy that you'll see on TV
I wasn't near as pretty as Mama wanted me to be
Well I grew up on the ranches just cussin' all day long
Breakin' in them broomtails and hummin' old dirty songs
Whiskey tends to make me high and sad songs make me cry
And pretty women break my heart almost every night
Well I run on beans and nicotine I'm a real live buckeroo
And my heart's not pure and my boots ain't clean and I never tell the truth
Well if there's anything under my hat besides the cattle biz
Well I just can't seem to remember what it is
Yeah my thinkin's kinda crude but my lovin' gets plumb rank
Them girlies just don't understand me a snortin' round their flanks
And when I take a nasty fall I'll cuss until I'm blue
Then I'll get right up and on again just like you're s'posed to do
But it ain't because I'm so brave all that stuff's just talk
My daddy says the reason is I'm dumber than a box of rocks yeah
Whiskey tends to make me high...
This song ain't bout no Strawberry Roan or no ram page herd of steers
This is just the type of cowboy song that you probably don't like to hear
This song ain't got no message and won't feel perty in yer ear
This song is just one of them there
Well this song is just one of them there these here yeah

If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
Now we can talk all night about the weather
Tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or I could ask what I really want to know
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
The rain can fall so soft against the window
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky
But daddy always told me, "Don't make small talk"
He said, "Come on out and say what's on your mind"
So if I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight

All I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
From time to time
I can never be more
Than a knock on your door
Just a shadow that's gone
With the sunshine
For you know I'm not free
And I never can be
And you're bound
To get restless in time
All I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
Tonight I shed
A silent tear
While lyin' here with you
The sands of time
Have trickled down
To just a precious few
You're young and so beautiful
And I'm so glad I'm here
But the ending is painfully clear
All I can be
Is a sweet memory
Of someone you had
To leave behind
Who loves you and needs you
But never could give you
The ring for your finger so fine
So tonight we'll just borrow
Each other tomorrow
We'll find that we've run out of time
And all I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
For you know I'm not free
All I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind

Why the day you were born, girl
Your mom and I named you, Tanya Montana
I just thought you should know
Your eyes were
As blue as the skies of Montana
Your skin was
As white as fresh falling snow
Tanya Montana is some thing to see
A dream that came true for your mother and me
A small piece of Heaven on earth as they say
But Tanya Montana is so far away
Why some day you're gonna grow up
And you're gonna leave us, sweet Tanya
And some man will steal you
Some man's gonna steal you away, I know
But you know me and your momma
Why we love you, Montana
Lord, it's going to break our hearts
When we see you go
Tanya Montana has been on my mind
Like the eagles that fly above reaching the light
Searching for freedom, you'll find it some day
And then Tanya Montana will be so far away

Pullin' into the fast lane
On the leavin' side of town
Just me and the dreams I've left undone
There's a whole lot of roads
That I could point this Chevy down
But I can only think of one
On this river concrete slab
A man could drive for days
And let his imagination run
There's time for a million memories along the way
But I can only think of one
Oh, I can only think of one
Summer down in Galveston, underneath the stars
A fire burnin' on the sand, ragin' in our hearts
If there's a time in my whole life
I've really been in love
I can only, I can only
I can only think of one
I'm not gonna turn back
'Til I'm back to where you are
To undo the damage that's been done
There may be a hundred ways
To mend this broken heart
But I can only think of one
Oh, I can only think of one

We'll walk the road of life together day by day
And I will love you every step of the way
The road may wind beneath the sky of blue or gray
But I will love you every step of the way
So only love me and love me only
And we will never walk with loneliness
For just as sure as every April turns to May
So will I love you every step of the way
I'll love you only every step of the way

Bitter Side Of Sweet
(Clint Black/Hayden Nicholas)
She asked me how love gets along with me all by myself.
Wonders how I keep from getting dust upon that shelf.
She wanted to know how a man like me ends up alone, anyway.
'Was I breakin' all the rules of love and the games that people play.
I said not too many hangin' round of all the ones I meet.
In time they always find that I'm on the bitter side of sweet.
She huddled on the gate on my block where I always catch my bus.
An' I hoped it wouldn't stop today, there'd just be the two of us.
But it showed up like it always does, about twenty minutes late.
I told her it'd right along but she said she couldn't wait.
She didn't need any assistance in putting some distance, between us on that
empty street.
She was of a mind, in record time that I'm on the bitter side of sweet.
That I act this was is really no my fault.
It just means all the sweet things I got to say,
Come along with a grain of salt.

Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
Where on the brink of love I kissed her and obeyed my heart's command
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
We watched the sunset in the evening in a far and distant land
So here beneath God's blue heaven there's a place I must go
See the sunset in the evening the only love I know
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
Where on the brink of love I kissed her and obeyed my heart's command
So here beneath God's blue heaven there's a place I must go

I sell the morning papers sir my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
You can hear me yellin' Morning Star runnin' along the street
Got no hat upon my head no shoes upon my feet
[ ac.guitar ]
Never mind sir how I look don't look at me and frown
Sell the morning papers sir my name is Jimmy Brown
I'm awful cold and hungry sir my clothes is mighty thin
Wander bout from place to place my daily bread to win
[ ac.guitar ]
My father died a drunkard sir I've heard my mother say
I am helpin' mother sir as I journey on my way
My mother always tells me sir I've nothing in the world to lose
I'll get a place in heaven sir to sell the Gospel News
[ ac.guitar ]
I sell the morning papers sir...

She was painting a picture of slum life when the cowboy came limping by
Wearing tattered old boots with one sole gone and a far away look in his eye
Well he watched for a while as she painted and then he said mama you surely paint well
Yes you got all this on your canvas the dirt the squalor and the hell
Well she asked to paint him in the setting ah but he shook his head slowly and low
He said naw I won't fit your picture unless you can paint be back home
Can you paint me back home in Wyoming riding free neath the big sky above
Free as the wind on the prairie out in the hills that I love
I long to get back to Wyoming and I've hoped all these years that I can
Please paint me back home on your canvas paint me back in Wyoming again
Well I never claimed this festered city
You know I was raised on a ranch out in the west
I spent my young years bustin' horses and boy they said I could ride with the best
So I came here to Madison Square Garden to ride in the big rodeo
Ah but I got stepped on and all crippled up and chute bronc bustin' is all I know
Ah boy if I could just get back to Wyoming I wouldn't feel so alone
Ah but the pain is too much for the roamin' so please can you paint me back home
Can you paint me back home in Wyoming...

He walked out in the arena all dressed up to the brim
Said he just came down from a place called Highland Rim
And he said he came to ride the horse the one they called the Brute
But he didn't look like a cowboy in the continental suit
We snickered at the way he dressed but he never said a word
Walked on by the rest of us as if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born than the one they called the Brute
The horse that he was lookin' for was in chute number eight
Walked up very slowly put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a purebred when he pulled a sack o' Deuce
From the inside pocket of his continental suit
He rolled himself a quirly and he lit it standin' there
Blew himself a smoke ring and he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy as he opened up the gate
Standin' just inside was fifteen hundred pounds of hate
The buckskin tried to run him down but the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms around the horse's neck
And he pulled himself upon the back of the horse they called the Brute
Sat like he was born there in his continental suit
The Brute's hind end was in the air his front end on the ground
Kickin' and a squealin' tryin' to shake the stranger down
But the stranger wouldn't give an inch he came to ride the Brute
He came to ride that buckskin in a continental suit
I turned around to look at Jim but he was watchin' me
Said I don't believe the crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw the one they call the Brute
Ridden by a cowboy in a continental suit
The Brute came to a standstill ashamed that he'd been rode
By some city cowboy in some continental clothes
The stranger took his money and we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from and we haven't seen him since
The moral of this story never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes could be a millionaire
So everybody listen don't be fooled by this galoot
Sure enough bronc rider in his continental suit

Lets play this one out, until it explodes
Into a thousand tiny pieces
Whats the story universe
You are melody in numbers
You were shapes you were rhythms
There are signs that we can learn
Place over the heavens
To predict how long well burn
How long will I last?
Can you turn up the heat?
What star am I circling?
Whats circling me?
Am I ebb, am I flow?
My lack of control
Turn it on, turn it up
Say yes, play no
Things keep changing
Things keep changing
Things keep changing

A stormy summer came and went
In the garden that we grew back then
I remember when
The single rose you gave to me
With a vow that you would never leave
One you didn't keep
Regretfully I understand
Why the flower crumbled in my hands
There's only eleven roses
I know, I should have known it from the start
I think I know, why there's only
Eleven roses left here to show
Something's missing from your heart
Pressed between the pages
I see the missing rose you couldn't find
From the years gone by
Sadly we just threw away
What could've been a beautiful bouquet
So I turned the page
Tonight I just can't bare to see
The faded rose that meant the most to me
There's only eleven roses
I know, I should have known it from the start
I think I know, why there's only
Eleven roses left here to show
Something's missing from your heart
The only thing that we forgot
Is do you love me or do you love me not?
There's only eleven roses
I know I should have known it from the start
I think I know, why there's only
Eleven roses left here to show
Something's missing from your heart
Only eleven roses

My heart is like a desert
Gone too long without rain
And your love is like the water
That makes the river run again
I'm burning like the Tucson sand
Broken as the partched, dry ground
I need to feel you
Raining down
I want to feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I want to drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
Well it feels like forever since
Last time I looked into your eyes
And I need to be reminded
And I need to be revived
So love me like a long lost friend
Caress me like the desert wind
And make a partched heart
Bloom again
I want to feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I want to drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I want to feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I want to drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
Rain
I need to feel you
In the Arizona rain
I want to feel your love
In the Arizona rain
I want to feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane (I want to feel your love)
I want to drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I want to feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I want to drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I want to feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I want to drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain

"Pretty Paper" is playing on the jukebox
And mistletoe is hanging above the bar
I want to thank you for this
Broken heart that I got
Merry Christmas Girl
Wherever in the world you are
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll be over you by New Year's Eve
"Blue Christmas" turn it up I want to hear it
So I can unwrap all them memories in my mind
Hey Joe!! pour me some Christmas spirit
If I make it through December I'll be fine
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
For these silent nights at home are killing me
It's going to be a honky tonk Christmas
But I'll bi over you by New Year's Eve
Yeah I'll be over you by
New Years Eve

Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
While I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
[ steel ]
Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands...

Married you four years ago,
Now I'm a soldier's wife.
Knew one day, you'd have to go,
I miss you in my nights.
In seven weeks, our baby's due,
You're half-a-world away.
Know our country's needin' you,
But all I have to say is:
Baby, come back home,
I need you too.
Baby, come back home,
Honey, I love you.
Next door neighbour's son was there,
Fightin' the same war.
We just heard the news today:
He won't be home no more.
Freedom never has come free,
There's a price to pay.
Lord knows, I'm proud of you,
But I miss you more each day.
Baby, come back home,
I need you too.
Baby, come back home,
Honey, I love you.
Until you're back home, darlin',
And in my arms to stay,
I pray God watches over you,
Every minute you're away.
Baby, come back home,
I need you too.
Baby, come back home,
Honey, I love you.
Honey, I love you.

I thought love went south for the wintertime
It's been cold so long
A new day's creeping in, I can feel change a-comin'
Here comes love
Here comes love
Come on
Won't ya come on in, let love start shinin'
Bright as the sun
Come on blind me girl, you light up my world
Aw, here comes love
Whoa oh, my, my
You're the one who caught my eye
Hey baby, you got a hold of me
I was lost in the night
But you led me to the light
There goes lonely, here comes love
There goes lonely, here comes love
You're deep in me, I can feel you with every heart beat
You're in my blood
With every look, every touch, darlin' you're a rush
Aw, here comes love
Whoa oh, my, my
You're the one who caught my eye
Hey baby, you got a hold of me
I was lost in the night
But you led me to the light
There goes lonely, here comes love
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh yea
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa oh, my, my
You're the one who caught my eye
Hey baby, you got a hold of me
I was lost in the night
But you led me to the light
There goes lonely, here comes love
There goes lonely, here comes love oh oh yeah yeah
Come on baby, want you take my hand
Why don't you step down to the promise land?
Aw, here comes love

We were barely seventeen
Two kids with the grown up dream
Of a perfect love
Foolin' round in my first car
Careful not to go too far
That's how it was.
We had a simple wedding
You looked beautiful in white
And I recall your mother's blessing
On our wedding night.
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.
We moved into a commission house
It wasn't much and it wasn't ours
But we had plans
I worked nights and you worked days
And twelve months seemed to slip away
Like an avalanche
I came home one morning
Found your note pinned to the door
Saying if this is a perfect love
I don't want it any more
But I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.
I was back in town just passing through
Catching up with friends we knew for old times sake
In a crowded lunch time bar
I turn around and there you are
Face to face
And for the sweetest moment
A smile came to your eyes
So I whispered as you walked away
With the new man at your side
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.

Not long ago you held our baby's bottle
But the one you're holding now's a different kind
You just sit and wait to be somebody's baby
And it all depends on who will buy the wine
Whoever sets them up and tips the waitress
Will be the one to share the love that's mine
You'd never know whose lips you'll soon be kissing
For it all depends on who will buy the wine
[ steel ]
The kind of life you're living since you left me
I'm sure it's not the life you thought you chosed
That honky tonkin' world is not so flashy
Bright lights and booze is all it really knows
Whoever sets them up...

Well now friends you'd never guess it so I really must confess it
I just met the sweetest woman of my long dismal life
But a friend of mine said buddy just in case your mind is muddy
Don't you know that girl you're fooling with is Peg-Leg Johnson's wife
And that man is hard and cold and mean and grim
And he'll catch you and he'll brain you with his artificial limb
But next morning bright and early I stole old Peg-Leg's girlie
And I also took his wooden leg just to play it safe
But there weren't no time for laughter cause he started hopping after
And I keep on running faster but he won't give up the chase
And I'm running through the mountains with his bride
And I got his wooden leg here by my side
I'm a three-legged man with a two-legged woman
Being chased across country by a one-legged fool
Though he's hoppin' and he's clappin' and he shows no sign of stoppin'
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel
Through the deserts and the valleys and those dark Chicago alleys
Cross the muddy Mississippi to the hills of Caroline
Through the mountains of Montana and the swamps of Louisiana
Each time that I look back he's just about one foot behind
And I know he must be cold and wet and sick
But in spite of all his troubles he can kick
Oh he's ragged and he's filthy and I'm feeling kinda guilty
Specially in the evenings when I hear him plead and beg
He says in spite of all your stealing friend I bear you no hard feelings
You can keep that damned old woman but please give me back my leg
Cause old friend I know you think you took my wooden leg
But in the dark you made a mistake you took my good leg
I'm a three-legged man...
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel

I came to see her daddy for sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting in the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes I'm Prince Charming
But to him I'm just some fella
Riding in and stealing Cinderella
I leaned in towards those pictures to get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say "Now, ain't she something, son?"
I said "Yes, she quite a woman"
And he just stared at me
Then I realized that in his eyes she would always be
Playing Cinderella
Riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes I'm Prince Charming
But to him I'm just some fella
Riding in and stealing Cinderella
He slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too
She was playing Cinderella
Riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fella
I'm the one who's stealing Cinderella"

Hello little bluebird I know how you feel
One time I thought I'd never learn too
But someone came along and helped me like I'm helping you
And if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune kept you down this time
But there's usually a reason for it all
You'll run into things that hurt you all the time
And the higher up the harder that you fall
First thing you have to do is be sure you wanna fly
Cause no one in the world can do it for you
Then practice what you learn by doin' all that you can do
Cause if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune...
So go spread your little bluebird wings and fly away
May the melodies of love always be with you
And someday you'll help someone remember what I'm telling you
If I can fly I'll bet you can too
La la da da la la la la if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too

You are a sunbeam and you will shine forever
Forever in our hearts now that you're gone
You are a sunbeam and you will shine wherever
Wherever your soul decides to roam
I wish you could have stayed a little longer
And shone more of your sunlight in our lives
But having known you I can feel a little stronger
Remembering the sunshine in your eyes
Sunbeam you are gone but not forgotten
You I'll carry with me everyday
I'll think about the smile you smiled so often
Until I see you once again someday
You are a sunbeam and you will shine forever
Forever in my heart now that you're gone
You are a sunbeam and you will shine wherever
Wherever your soul decides to roam
I wish you could have stayed a little longer
And shone more of your sunlight in our lives
But having known you I can feel a little stronger
Remembering the sunshine in your eyes
Sunbeam you are gone but not forgotten
You I'll carry with me everyday
I'll think about the smile you smiled so often
Until I see you once again someday

Hey, lay me down some rails boys
Don't put me in jail boys
And if I make a little noise
Just leave me alone
I've been known to party some
But I ain't never hurt no one
I've been ashamed of what I've done
Especially when I'm stoned
I've spent most of my life in honest thinking
And I never cared too much for serious drinking
Marijuana makes my eyes start blinking
And incense make my sinuses drain
So, lay me down some rails boys
Don't put me in jail boys
And if I make a little noise
Just leave me alone
I've been known to party some
But I ain't never hurt no one
I've been ashamed of what I've done
Especially when I'm stoned
Now women make me think of consolation
Prison makes me think of isolation
Niggers made me vote for segregation
And cocaine makes me hard as a rock
So, lay me down some rails boys
Don't put me in jail boys
And if I make a little noise
Just leave me alone
I've been known to party some
But I ain't never hurt no one
I've been ashamed of what I've done
Especially when I'm stoned
Well it's hard to work for a dollar a week
And the Ku Klux Klan is bigger
So take the sheets off of your beds
And let's go hang a nigger
And lay me down some rails boys
Don't put me in jail boys
And if I make a little noise
Just leave me alone
I've been known to party some
But I ain't never hurt no one
I've been ashamed of what I've done
Especially when I'm stoned

Scattered Leaves
(Jeremy Lindsey)
Don't you go looking so surprised, baby don't you look so stunned
Didn't I tell you that a cold november'd come?
And deliver the leaves from green to red,
To blowing in the wind stone dead
Well I never used to notice this awful quiet, mmmmh
And fall was just the calm before the next spring riot, mmmhh
Of wildflowers and lunatic rivers -
Sweat jumping off of the skin of love givers, mmh (in the park)
Scattered leaves don't lie
Aw' now baby, baby, quit your cryin'
Like everything that ever mattered, scit-scat scattered
Like every love word you heard
But that's just the way when you walk your days
In the beauty of this world
(repeat)
Pretty little disappointments all in a row
Been about a year since you disappeared through my door
And now you come back with your head on straight,
But I got no love or hate left for you, girl
You must be the daughter of the late, late rose - I'm November's son
And I'm here to tell you, honey, ooh what's done is done
Yeah, I been claimed by the wind and the rain
There ain't no going back, naw there ain't no going back again (for us now)
Repeat chorus

I've been chasing you around
When I go up, you're down
I'm tired of fooling around
Hope you're life is better now
You want to run from...
I can't give up on...
all of my dreams
Hope they don't leave me too
How long will it take?
I already said, "I do"
I liked myself with you
but you think it's worthless for whatever reasons
All of my friends
Hope they don't leave me too
How long will it take
for you
I have been here
and you've done what you want
Call if you want to
hide when you don't
I don't care
All of your dreams
Hope they don't leave you too
And when no one else sees
I see only you
How long will it take?

[Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam.
I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.
Yes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance.
All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,
'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt.

In the tears you gave to me
I found a river to an ocean
Concrete sky and a stone cold sea
I came to where the emptiness cracked open
All my fears came crashing through
And met the fire of my sorrow
But I found my strength in forgiving you
I never even dreamed how far my heart could go
To give my life beyond each death
From a deeper well of trust
To know that when there's nothing left
You will always have what you gave to love
In this life the love you give
Comes back around to be your treasure
What you lose will be what you win
A well that echoes down too deep to measure

Especially with my head pounding
and lying helpless in my bed
I long for you and your expert hands
To ease this white heat from my head
And you would boast that you knew
All the pressure points inside
And you could just as easily kill me
Beneath the desire that I hide
But as your patient I knew
That your healing powers had grown
From a sore that's far far deeper
Than this heart where the pain was born
With my head again clear
I think of words to send to you
To coax you back to my side
But always leave out "I love you"

Your forever telling me I'm weak
When I'm critized I never speak
I prefer to turn the other cheek
But I will love you all my life
I can never do things right by you
I'm the kind of man who muddles thru
You can find mistakes in all I do
But I will love you all my life
Something foolish happens and you see
In the Middle of it all is me
Seems I cause you so much misery
But I will love you all my life
All my life, All I own
Everything is yours alone
Everyday my whole life thru
I will spend loving you
Everybody says for you I'm wrong
You'll get nowhere Fast with me along
They keep telling me I don't belong
But I will love you all my life
All my life, All I own
Everything is yours alone
Everyday my whole life thru
I will spend loving you
I will love you all my life

I'm out here everyday breakin' haerts along the way
I cause ears to fall and some to lose it all
This whole world would be
Better off without me
Well, I'm the saddest words you've spoken
I'm a promise broken
I'm the ballgame that you missed
I'm the calls that don't come in
I'm every poor excuse you use to cover up the truth
I tell the people that you love
That they don't matter quite enough
There's no stoppin' me once I'm in motion
I'm a promise broken
Disappointment, disillusion
Despair, confusion
I've seen it all in their eyes
Don't promise you will if you won't
Don't say you do if you don't
Its alright to say you'll try
Well, I get pushed aside when you move on with your life
But I'll stand the test of time in your heart and in your mind
You'll think about me now and then
Wonder how your life might've been
But I will leave you never knowin'
Well, I'm a promise broken
I'm a promise broken

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Tennessee to those LA nights
The San Antone' to Vegas lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
[Chorus: x2]
There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
[Chorus: x3]

Once I had a heart cold as ice love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun
Once I had a trick up my sleeve and a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young girl I found
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love
Now who'd have thought that someone like you could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit

Yesterday I thought that I was low as I could get
I'd hit rock bottom ever since you up and left
But this morning when I saw you with somebody else, well, needless to say
That's when I started sinking even lower
And as far as where I'm at today
There's two feet of topsoil
A little bit of bedrock,
Limestone in between
A fossilized dinosaur
A little patch of crude oil
A thousand feet of granite underneath
And then there's me
I was kinda hopin' I could dig my way back out
A couple dozen roses, maybe get you back somehow
But the love in your eyes as you talked to him today was plain to see
So I ain't gonna get involved,
But should you change your mind
Well, you know right where I'll be
There's two feet of topsoil
A little bit of bedrock,
Limestone in between
A fossilized dinosaur
A little patch of crude oil
A thousand feet of granite underneath
And then there's me
There's two feet of topsoil
A little bit of bedrock,
Limestone in between
A fossilized dinosaur
A little patch of crude oil
A thousand feet of granite underneath
And then there's me
There's two feet of topsoil
A little bit of bedrock,
Limestone in between
A fossilized dinosaur
A little patch of crude oil
A thousand feet of granite underneath
And then there's me

I'm just a plain ol' country kid and I like to do what's right
Just like any other boy I like to hold 'em tight
Sometimes they got resistance but no matter how I tried
Then a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I'll say honey, you better not do that and she'll say why
And I'll say cause you just better not do that
When I was in a country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satisfied
And I'd say honey you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'd say cause you just better not do that
Now when I was a little older I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun I was a thinkin' bout romance
But the dim lights just lured upon and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long I'm human you see
And I'd say baby you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'd say cause you just better not do that
Well that's the way my life has been ain't it a cryin' shame
How much longer can I last if I keep playin' the game
Sometimes I don't know who I am do they know what they're doin'
I'm afraid in years to come that girls will be my ruin
And I'll say honey you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'll say cause you just better not do that and she'd say why George
And I'll say ah well um it's alright if you do that

Verse 1
I'm in the way, the bright and shining way, I'm in the gloryland way;
Telling the world that Jesus saves today, Yes I'm in the gloryland way.
I'm in the glory land way I'm in the gloryland way.
Chorus
I'm in the glory-land way, I'm in the glory-land way;
Heaven is nearer, and the way growth clearer,
For I'm in the gloryland way.
Chorus 2
List to the call, the gospel call today, Get in the gloryland way;
Wanderers come home, O hasten to obey,
And get in the gloryland way.
Verse 3
Onward I go, rejoicing in His love, I'm in the gloryland way;
Soon I shall see Him in that home above,
O, I'm in the gloryland way.

He came speeding through the town each day at sundown
And his car was painted candy apple red
He was coming there to see the sheriff's daughter
And the sheriff didn't know it so they said
Time and time again the sheriff tried to catch him
But he always speeded up and got away
The old county jail stood patiently awaiting
And the sheriff vowed he'd put him there some day
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red
So the sheriff built a barricade to catch him
And he sat there at the limits of the town
But the sheriff's daughter had already met him
And had married him before the sun went down
When the sheriff saw the coming down the highway
He saw they couldn't stop and so he held his breath
As they crashed the barricade the car exploded
And the boy and girl went to a flaming death
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
He didn't slow it down at all and he lies there dead
Now the sheriff bowed his head his daughter laied there dead
There in the arms of candy apple red

Tennessee, Oh Tennessee
Lord there's nothing like a fall in Tennessee
It was a Smokey Mountain morning, October 25
You know she left here without warning
So I took a long, long drive
Tried to change the state my heart was in
Out of all the places I have been
Tennessee, Tennessee
There's nothin' like a fall in Tennessee
For a gold old fashioned heartbreak
There's no place I'd rather be
Cause there's nothin' like a fall in Tennessee
She must of had her reasons
Was it the chill in the air
I guess lovers have their seasons
Where their souls are layin' bare
It's better now her true colors show
This time of year there's only one place to go
Tennessee, Tennessee
There's nothin' like a fall in Tennessee
For a gold old fashioned heartbreak
There's no place I'd rather be
Cause there's nothin' like a fall in Tennessee

Three fishers went sailing out into the west,
Oh, into the west as the sun went down;
Each thought of the woman,
That loved him the best,
And the children stood watching them out on the town.
For men must work and the women must weep,
For there's little to earn and many to keep;
And the harbour bar be moaning?
The harbour bar be moaning.
Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,
And trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;
And they looked at the squall,
And they looked at the shower,
The nightbird came rolling in ragged and drowned.
Men must work and the women must weep,
Tho storms be sudden and the waters be deep;
And the harbour bar be moaning?
The harbour bar be moaning.
*Instrumental*
Men must work and the women must weep,
Tho storms be sudden and the waters be deep;
And the harbour bar be moaning?
The harbour bar be moaning.
Three corpses lay out on the shining sand,
In morning green as the tide went down;
And the women were weeping and wringing their hands,
For those who would never come back to the town.
Men must work and the women must weep,
For the sooner it's over the sooner to sleep;
And goodbye to the bar and its moaning,
Goodbye to the bar and its moaning.

Ive been sitting down here so long I composed a song
I wanna meet you Country gal
Every time she dance I wish I had the chance
Theres a river flowing in every man
All the trees do sway when she dance that way
I wanna meet you country gal
I swear she must have been born from that blossoms breeze
She got diamonds all around her ankle bone
She got her gals gathered round and the boys cant make no time
Shes like a ruby rolling round in a bucket of dimes
She got skin like chocolate milk-make a married man feel no guilt
The way she moves when she moves and she groove
Somebody slap my face and throw me under the jail
Cause I cant stop thinking about that country gal

A little bit of that apple pan dowdy
Pickin them scuppernon's off that vine
Chigger bite, it's goin' to beat howdy
Ate me a bucket of Muscadine

Drop my line down a crawdad hole

Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
My good gal left me with a troubling mind
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Gone down behind the mountain and it won't be back till morn
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Gonna talk to my honey all night long
Oh take me back and try me one more time
Oh take me back and try me one more time
And if I don't do then send me down the line

Drifting with the girl down the moonlit stream
While above the heavens in their glory gleam
And the stars on high twinkle oin the sky
Scheming in a paradise of love divine
Dreaming of a paradise that love in mine
Beautiful Ohio in dreams again I see visions of what used to be
Drifting in the moonlight while the heavens gleam ay ay ay ay
Scheming in a paradise...

Heavenly Days
Look at that sky
It could've been rainin'
It could've been dry
It could've been cloudy
It could've been clear
It could've been sunshine
It could've been drear
It could've been so many ways
Heavenly Days
Havenly Days
So what do we do?
Dare to be different
Dare to be true
Bury the treasure
Like we've always done
Or crawl from the wreckage
And walk in the sun
Fannin' the flame 'til it's a blaze
Heavenly Days
Heavenly Days
Look at us now
We're comin' up roses
And takin' a bow
Tennessee tomboy
Feminine girl
Takin' a ride
On the top of the world
Nobody's master
Nobody's slave
Heavenly Days
It's your place in line
It's your right of birth
It's your light to shine
Down on God's green earth
It's your brother's hand
It's your sister's smile
It's your father's plan
For your mother's child
And it's comin' in waves
Heavenly Days

There are witches in the hills calling my name
Saying come join us sister, come kiss the flame
Come dance in the moonbeams, ride the night wind
Make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins
I shiver with delight, I shiver with fear
My heart wants to go but my soul's filled with fear
So I turn to my lover and ask what do I do
Do I answer their call or stay here with you
But under spell of deep sleep he moans and turns away
Taking his protection and my desire to stay
So I rise to the hill tops, I ride the night winds
I make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins

Last night you came home late
You tried to tiptoe in
I sat here for hours
Wondering where you've been
You ran into an old friend
And you just lost track of time
When you told me that there was something
About the twinkle in your eye
So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal
It's the easiest thing, I could have done
When you love someone for the long run
For the long run
I know, I'm no angel
You know that's the truth
There's no need to remind me
Of all that we've been through
But the good times keep on coming
And the bad ones ain't so bad
And the worst that ever happens
Is still the best I've ever had
So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal
It's the easiest thing, I could have done
When you love someone for the long run
For the long run
One thing that you've taught me
That I never knew before
No one ever loses
If no one's keeping score
So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal
It's the easiest thing, I could have done
When you love someone for the long run
When you love someone for the long run
When you love someone
Who's in it for the long run

Around here, it's the hardest time of year
Waking up, the days are even gone
The collar of my coat
Lord help me, cannot help the cold
The raindrops sting my eyes
I keep them closed.
But I'm feelin' no pain
I'm a little lonely and my quietest friend
Have I the moonlight? Have I let you in?
Say it ain't so, say I'm happy again
Say it's over, say I'm dreaming,
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks
I'm all right. Don't I seem to be?
Aren't I swinging on the stars?
Don't I wear them on my sleeve?
When you're looking for a crossroads,
It happens every day
And whichever way you turn,
I'm gonna turn the other way
Say it's over, say I'm dreaming,
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Learn to let it bend before it breaks
Say it's over say I'm dreaming,
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks

Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory

[ Both ]
Yes his love takes good care of me yes his love takes good care of me
And when the rain falls the wind blows the storm is on the sea
I'll be safe his love takes care of me
[ Connie ]
When life for me gets weary and the sun refuses to shine
I'll run to the arms of my Lord and there I will hide
He knows just what I need each day he's with me in the night
And if my footstep heaven strays his hand will guide me right
[ Both ]
For his love takes good care of me...
For his love takes good care of me...
Yes I'll be safe his love takes good care of me

I'd give anything to go back
Do anything to go there
To take my breath away again
I still see your face right there
Staring at me and I swear
I can feel you here
When I close my eyes
I know I should drop everything
And run straight back to your side
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
Every step, every turn that I take
Every thought, every move that I make
Brings me closer to you
If the day is done and I haven't found you
I'll take my love and turn around
Go down another road and try again
Yea, try again
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
I'm gonna find a new way to love you
I'm gonna find the one way to hold you
Cuz I just can't stay
Sitting around
Waitin on love to come back around
Back around
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Yea, no red lights stopping me
Never gonna slow me down
Starting now
Yea, starting now
I'm headin for ya baby
Starting now
I'm gonna find ya baby
Startin now
Ooooo
Ooooo

Don't be concerned it's time I learned
That those who play with fire get burned
But I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
Don't be too quick to pity me
Don't salve my heart with sympathy
'Cause I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
The world looks on with wonder
And pity at your kind
'Cause it knows that the future
Is not very pretty for your kind for your kind
Will always be runnin' and wonderin'
What's happened to hearts that you've broken
And left all alone
But we'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
Runnin' lonely

Seen the bright lights of Memphis
And the Commodore Hotel
And it was there beneath the streetlamp
Where I met a southern belle
Well she took me to the river
Where she cast her spell
And it was 'neath that Memphis moonlight
She sang this song so well
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land
We hit all the hot spots
My money flowed like wine
Till the lowdown southern whiskey
Began to fog my mind
Well I don't remember church bells
Or the money I put down
On the white picket fence and boardwalk
At the house on the edge of town
Now but boy do I remember
The strain of her refrain
And the nights we spent together
And the way she called my name
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land
It's been a year since she ran away
Guess that guitar player sure could play
She always liked to sing along
He was always handy with a song
Then one night in the lobby
Of the Commodore Hotel
I by chance met a bartender
Who said he knew her well
And as he handed me a drink
He began to hum a song
And all the boys there at the bar
Began to sing along
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land

When I was a lad an old cowboy told me well son you're sure ridin' well
There's fame and there's fortune
And glory waitin' at the end of the rodeo trail
So I packed up my stuff in my old pickup truck to follow my rodeo dreams
Now I'm finally on the top but I feel like a flop
Cause I've spent all the fortune I've seen
Now where is the glory in drivin' all night
Down a highway that's headed to nowhere
What good's the fame when the fortune's all gone
And the dreams turned into a nightmare
Like Ed Bruce said Mamma's don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
I'm inclined to agree but if you ask me you know I'd go through it again
Now what does it take to be a rodeo cowboy I guess I'm a expert at that
Takes a whole lot of guts and old lady luck but not too much under this hat
Well he thrives on the crowds yellin' real load for him to face dyin' again
But the good Lord takes care of children and fools
He's no kid so what's that make him
Now where is the glory...

She's the first one on the dance floor when the music starts to play
She's the first to buy the band around the drink
She's just out to have a good time, dances every set they play
And she don't care what anybody thinks
She's a sad and lonely Texas dance hall girl
Who's just tryin' to bring a smile to this old world
But behind the smile a broken heart, lives in another world
She's a sad and lonely Texas dance hall girl
No one really knows the story that there's an old love on her mind
'Cause the certain song brings teardrops to her eyes
But they only dare a minute then she's laughing one more time
With what little happiness a teardrop buys
She's a sad and lonely Texas dance hall girl
Who's just tryin' to bring a smile to this old world
But behind the smile a broken heart, lives in another world
She's a sad and lonely Texas dance hall girl
She's just a sad and lonely Texas dance hall girl

A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him 'til he cries he goes home the next afternoon
'Fore you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a PHD and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
Is all because two people fell in love
Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney creek
You'll find potato salad, hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up fillin' their paper plates
They've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love
There ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people feel in love
Well, I recall a young man who was driftin' aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little café right off of Fourteenth Avenue
With a whole lotta help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love
Baby, there ain't nothin' not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
I'm glad your dad could not resist
Your mama's charms and you exist
All because two people fell in love
You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him 'til he cries he goes home the next afternoon

[Verse 1]
Barry Tolbert, Lookout Lane
He was white knuckling a diamond ring
And fumbling for the dome light
Sherry Lynn knows somethings up
'Cause Berry ain't ever been stuck
For words like he is tonight
Since they pulled over, her hearts been beatin' faster
Without that song, who knows, he might have never asked her
[Chorus]
Simple words put into lines
Just a melody and rhyme
But at that moment seemed so strong
How can a piece of poetry
Knock a grown man to his knees
And lead him by the heart to where he belongs
Then it came on
The song
[Verse 2]
Larry Pearson had a crutch
One more was never enough
He'd say "I can quit anytime"
The whole town knew his name
They'd all say what a shame
He's wastin' away his life
A strangers quarter dropped into that corner jukebox
It's been almost two years and guess what made him stop
[Chorus]

Little boys and little girls
Dream of big, big things
They're taught at a tender age
Just what life should bring
Get a job, say "I do" and settle yourself down
But what about those of us
Who's lives are still spinnin' around
Tell me what's so great about picket fences
Paintin' them's such a mess
And a big backyard where kids can play
I'd pro'bly never get a moments rest
And settin' the table for five at five
Only means more dishes to load
What's so great about picket fences
I guess I'll never know
Here I am in my prime, at least they tell me so
But if I go to sleep at night, I always go alone
I guess that I could have it all
And someone by my side
But I can't take, the give and take
The price is just too high
Tell me what's so great about picket fences
Paintin' them's such a mess
And a big backyard where kids can play
I'd pro'bly never get a moments rest
And settin' the table for five at five
Only means more dishes to load
What's so great about picket fences
I guess I'll never know

Tangled up in you, feeling so complete
With every single move you satisfy me
Baby just one touch, your breath upon my skin
And I can't help myself, I'm thirsty again
[Chorus]
I just can't get enough
There's no such thing as too much
You give me all you've got to give and then
I'm thirsty again
Sometimes I catch myself staring at the sky
Looking for the clouds 'cause my lips are dry
I don't need a flood for the craving to begin
Just one drop of rain and I'm thirsty again
[Chorus]
I just can't get enough
There's no such thing as too much
You give me all you've got to give and then
I'm thirsty again
Your love is drowning me
But I still need one more drink
I just can't get enough
There's no such thing as too much
No, I just can't get enough
There's no such thing as too much
You give me all you've got to give and then
I'm thirsty again

In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of the faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
She's saying, she's praying.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card
And just turn off all the noise.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh like little toy guns

His eyes could melt her soul
He's makin' all his moves just right
His smile has her longin' for
His touch tonight
Does he want someone to love
Is this a game she's played before
She's heard her share of bedtime tales
This time she's wantin' more
Should she take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
He would take her home
But should she leave alone
'Cause she don't want to be
Just another bedtime story
Her face has filled his dreams
Now he's a prisoner of her charms
And he'd give anything he's got
To hold her in his arms
As they dance around the floor
He keeps looking for a sign
If he tells her what is in his heart
Would she think it's just a lie
Should he take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
He would take her home
But should he leave alone
'Cause he don't want to be
Just another bedtime story
She could be his Cinderella
He could be her Prince Charming
Sometimes even fairy tales come true
Should they take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
Should he take her home
Should they leave alone
'Cause they don't want to be
Just another bedtime story

I gave you my heart for years and years
What more do you want from me
My laughter and my lonely tears
What more do you want from me
I've been faithful to you beginning to end
Isn't that enough
I gave you my all and I gave it again
What more do you want
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
I've been fooled by what I believed was you
Oh what a sweet disguise
I pledged my heart forever true
'Cause I thought it was you in her eyes
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
Oh give me a clue, what is it with you
Is there somethin' that I can't see
What more do you need what more could there be
What more do you want
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
Oh love, what more do you want from me

Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
When I'm broke an' I got no where to go
Been hangin' around with a good time friends of mine
Hangin' around with a good time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime
Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary in blues everywhere I see
Weary blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me
Way I'm sleepin', my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleepin', my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied
If I can catch that fast train and ride

Tiger woman I heard that you were back in town (tiger woman)
Tiger woman I heard that you were back in town (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger woman girl you're still puttin' puttin' around
Tiger woman I wonder why I love you still (tiger woman)
Tiger woman I wonder why I love you still (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger woman I guess you come back home for the kill
Well you tore me up in little bitty pieces you dragged me all over the ground
I was a big man but now I ain't nothin' you sure know how to put a good man down
Tiger woman put your long short claws out of me (tiger woman)
Tiger woman put your long short claws out of me (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger woman what you leave ain't so good to see
[ guitar ]
Well you tore me up...
Tiger woman well you better just keep movin' on (tiger woman)
Tiger woman I said you better just keep movin' on (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger tamer I'm gonna put you where you belong
(Hey looky here woman I don't like the way you come slink around me
I don't like that look you've got in your eye nor neither...)

Who at my door is standing?
Patiently drawing near
Entrance within demanding
Who is the voice I hear?
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for Me
If thou wilt heed My calling
I will abide with thee
Lonely without Him staying
Lonely within am I
While I am still delaying
Will He not pass me by?
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
If thou wilt heed my calling
I will abide with thee

When I bought this guitar it had brand new strings
brand new strap all those things
brand new pick both thumb and flat
all the elementary things like that
I went ahead and took it everywhere I went
couldn't count the hours that I must have spent
I heard the girl was lookin' for a guitar man
An' I'll oblige her anyway I can
'Cause I can win her over
like Romeo an' Juliet
If I can only show her
I can learn to pick that legato lick like Chet
It'll take more than Mel Bay 1, 2, & 3
If I'm ever gonna play like CGP
My legato is staccato but what I don't fret
is droppin' any note that I don't get
'Cause I can win her over
like Romeo an' Juliet
If I can only show her
I can learn to pick that legato lick like Chet
I can win her over
like Romeo an' Juliet
If I can only show her
I can learn to pick that legato lick like Chet

Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do (pick for me James)
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh but I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

The note said, you've had time to think about it
Looks like to me you're feelin' kinda crowded
You're not lookin' for anything permanent here
So my Rodeo's packed and in goodbye gear
So I shot down to the Longhorn Diner
Her sister works there and she'd know where to find her
She said, you didn't hear it from me
All I'll say is mama's got that place out in Monterrey
Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy apple red Rodeo
Two towns back I showed your photograph
And the gas station man just started to laugh
She said I might see you in this bucket of rust
And said good luck boy, just follow that cloud of dust
Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy apple red Rodeo
Maybe I was straddling the fence just like she said
It took her leaving to get it through my head
She's the one and only, it's over, that's it
I'm committed, I'm in love and I'm desperate
She's a good ways gone but I'm closin' the gap
If I have to I'll chase her clear across the map
Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy apple red Rodeo

She ain't got no money
Clothes are kinda funny
Hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
She talks kinda lazy
People say she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling so fine
That I just gotta say
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away
I'm a lucky fella
And I just gotta tell her
That I love her endlessly
Oh, cause love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

He don't know how to lie or undermine you
He don't know how to steal how to deal or decieve
So leave him alone set him free
Cause he's speaking with the angel
Speaking with the angel that only he can see
You say he's so helpless but what about you
You don't pull the strings don't you know anything
Leave him alone let him be
Cause he's speaking with the angel
Speaking with the angel that only he can see
Would you teach him about heaven
Would you show him how to love the earth

Would you poison him with prejudice from the moment of his birth
SOLO
He in the name of love in the blood of the lamb
He that never lays the blame
He don't even know his name
Leave him alone set him free
Cause he's speaking with the angel
Speaking with the angel
The very one that spoke to you and me
Do you remember

The Texas coastline hold her
Close just like a lady
And in their time they've
Weathered a storm or two.
The river feed her waters like
I feed your memory.
The deeper I go the more I'm turning blue.
The sandy beaches drift in time
And the changing tide I know
Won't bring me back to yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico.
The sails out on the water will
Come take you away.
When your ship comes in I know its time to go
And the waves along the seawall
Tell me nothings here to stay
And no man is an island but I'm still all alone.
I'm weighing anchors from the past
As the south winds start to blow
Sailing out of yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico.
I'll be sailing out of yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico.

Writer: Steve Goodman
It was all I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even call me by my name.
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charley Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
Even though you're on my fighting side.
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even call me by my name.
Spoken:
Well, you know me and The Possum Eatin' Cowboys have
Been playin' this song for a long time out there on the
Road. It's a touchin' little Steve Goodman number 'bout
Trains and trucks and mamas and prison and gettin' drunk.
So anyway, me and the boys got together and we asked
Mr. David Allen Coe and a few of our other heroes if they
Wouldn't mind singin' with us on what has proven itself to
Be the perfect country western song.
I was drunk the day my mama got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in the pickup truck
She got ran over by a damned old train.
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
You don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even call me....
Well I wonder why you don't call me...
Why don't you ever call me by my name.

Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Wanna little more right and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke, yeah
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course but my definition of change
Just ain't the same
I'm gonna sit right here, stay away from there
I'm gon' make pretend I just don't care
I could get up, go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke, yeah
Yeah, go get her back oh
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
I kick back, give the blues spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, take me back
I kick back, give the blues spin
Break out the wine, just forget again
Dig down deep, strike my stash
Light it up, memory crash
Oh no, I don't know, baby my take on life
Maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Gon' drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke yea

Baby wants me to go cold turkey bone dry
No Jack Daniels no Jim Beam whiskey bone dry
No stoppin' after work for a beer with the guys
Nothin' in the mornin' to open my eyes
Well I'm comin' down from a permanent high bone dry
I got my doubts if I can make it a bone dry
It's a crazy world I don't know if I can take it a bone dry
It's only been an hour I'm startin' to shake
Sixty more minutes and I know I'll break
How much more of this hell can I take bone dry
Well bone dry boy am I dry as a bone
How'd I ever say I'd ever leave it alone
Break down shake down layin' in bed
Covers are soaked and I'm damn near dead and I'm bone dry
Baby took a look at her cold turkey bone dry
I tried to smile but my mouth wasn't working I was bone dry
This is one promise that I'm gonna keep
Unless I get lucky and die in my sleep
One way or the other I'm gonna be bone dry

Get ups, gimmicks, one hit wonders that don't stick
Pretty boys, acting tough, boy bands give it up
And if it looks good on TV, it'll look good on a CD
Shape it up, trim it down, who gives a damn 'bout how it sounds
I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but boys come on let's get real
You still got a lotta boot left to fill
You say you're the real deal
But you play what nobody feels
You sing about Johnny Cash
The man in black would've whipped your ass
I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but boys come on let's get real
You still got a lotta boot left to fill
So, so long 'til I see you again
When you're laying in the bargain bin
Well, I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but then again, hell yes I am
I just don't give a damn 'cause you still got a lotta boot left to fill
I guess we all got a lotta boot left to fill
Yeah that's right

The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys
Kickin' tire round the pick up truck
Drinkin' been and just cuttin' up
Smokin' and jokin' out behind the shed
Cussin' a blue streak till the girls turn red
The only diffrence between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys
Sneakin' out of the house tryin' to have a little fun
Lookin' for somethin' that he ain't done
Look what the cat dragged in at the break of dawn
He ain't passed out he's campin' on the lawn
The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys
You can spend a lifetime growin' up
You can spend a lifetime in a rut
When it comes a time to make a choice
Most men would just as soon be boys
The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys

These things happen
Love never comes with a guarantee
No hard meetings
But it looks like this love was never meant to be
That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say
There'll be changes
Times never been known to ever stand still
Lonely losers
Hold to a promise they'll never fulfill
That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say
You tell me you know hat it's wrong
To walk out this way
But in time my true love will come
And I'll thank you some day
That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say
That's easy for you to say

Hold on a minute it ain't time to leave
Tell me how you're feeling one more time
Four long years and I just can't believe
That I'm still yours and you're still mine
While I was gone, yes, I fell in love
Asked around and heard that you did too
Two drunken years and push came to shove
I met love, love left me blue
You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
And I'm all right, yeah, I think I'm fine
My savior lives in telephones
And I just dream of you and step outside
Dial up and hope that you're home
You're rising like a sun
That waits up all night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
Hold on a minute, yeah, I do love you
Sometimes I guess that ain't enough
When I came round again you put me through
And I thank you, oh, so much
Another year, maybe, three or four
Maybe five or six or even more
You'll find another man to take my place
And I'll see you on the good Lord's shores
You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life

I'm gonna ride ride ride ride down that dusty trail
To the land of sweet enchantment where hardship don't prevail
I'm headin' for the blue horizon where the mountains meet the sky
Gonna saddle up my faithful pinto and wave the boys goodbye
I'll say so long to mom and dad and tell sister not to cry
Cause I'm headin' for the blur horizon where the mountains meet the sky
I'm gonna ride ride ride ride down that dusty trail
To the land of sweet enchantment where hardship don't prevail
When my roundup days are over and I'll say my last goodbye
I'll be up in the blue horizon where the mountains meet the sky

She saw him for the first time in that open all night diner
When she served him up some chili and a beer
And the feeling that she got when he grinned across the counter
Was across between excitement and the fear
He looked as hard and dry as the back roads that he traveled
Chasin' rodeos through half a hundred towns
He said hang up your apron honey and brush down your hair
And well go ya hooin' around
He's a true western movie without any star G's something like she's never known
But she's seen enough movies to know how they'll end
He'll ride into the sunset alone
He makes her feel like a kid cuttin' school
But by now she should be old enough to know
That today ain't forever and there's only so long
You can't take all your pleasures to go
But as long as it lasts she'll just keep hangin' on cause she's just along for the ride
And Lord if they fly to high and even if she falls all she can hurt is her pride
He's a true western movie

Ridding along the same old boat
Gotta sink your feet, and our love wont float
The sun don't shine as the cloud passes by
An emotion of penniless tears you made me cry
So sorry captain I'm taking over this ship
Oh its mutiny baby cause I just got hit
[Chorus]
I'm on to you, I'm on to you
I know each and every little thing you do
I'm on to you baby, in on to you
O.N.T.O.Y.O.U
You had me walking the plank and eventually shoved
Fell head over heels and into the sea of love
Swimming in circles and dodging them sharks
But when he got there no put a man on that ark
If I had any sense I would come to my senses
Start drowning my sorrows start getting intense
[Chorus]
Somebody stopped me before I started
I got him feeling ? that was the original sin
C'mon baby let me spell it out for you
I'm O.N.T.O.Y.O.U
[Repeat: x3]
I'm on to you
I'm O.N.T.O.Y.O.U
[Repeat: x2]
I'm on to you
I'm O.N.T.O.Y.O.U

I cut my teeth on a poker chip my daddy left layin' behind
The said he was a dealin' from the bottom but my mama said they were lyin'
So I never stay in one place long I'm just a natural born rambler
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler
So don't kiss my cheek and look at me with stayin' in your eyes
For marriage is like shootin' against a pair of loaded dice
You better throw your hand in for you just cant hold this rambler
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler
I'll say you're the closest thing to love I've ever known
But without the feel of the paddle wheel I'd never be at home
Well I must go for I just heard the river call this rambler
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler
So don't kiss my cheek...
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler

Ah-ah-ah-aaaaah
Ah-ah-ah-aaaaah
My own true love
My own true love
At last I've found you
My own true love
No lips but yours
No arms but yours
Will ever lead me
Through Heaven's door
I roamed the Earth
In search of this
I knew I'd know you
Know you by your kiss
And by your kiss
You've shown true love
I'm yours forever
My own true love
My own true love

There's an old tear stained, worn King James
Bible on my lap
I can hear mama now say it won't let you down
And it never has
So I turn to the Psalms straight to the one
That I can quote by heart
But the words that used to comfort me are tearing me apart
[Chorus]
He leaded me through death's dark valley
And by still waters too
Surely goodness and his mercy
Are gonna pull me through
But tonight I've wrestled wit the devil
Wrestled with the truth
If the lord is my shepherd
And I shall not want
Why do I still want you
All my friends say this will end
You're not the one for me
Cause I'm the kind that loves for life
And your the kind that leaves
So I've been praying and I've been waiting
For some kind of peace
But you haven't phoned and I'm leaning on Old Psalms twenty-three
[Chorus]

Kaw-Liga
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga well he just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga well he stood there as lonely as can be
'Cause his heart was an ol' pine knotty tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
He took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Well he stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed

I was certain you'd always love me I was certain you'd never change
I gave my love to you completely I felt so certain of everything
(But now you're gone you're gone) and that's for certain
(I'm all alone all alone) and can't quit hurtin'
You're still the only one I'm livin' for
Seems that's all I know for certain anymore
(But now you're gone you're gone) and that's for certain
(I'm all alone all alone) and can't quit hurtin'
Life won't ever be the way it was before
Seems that's all I know for certain anymore

(Gordon Kennedy/Wayne Kirkpatrick/Trisha Yearwood)
One light blinking off and on
Blood of life in this town is gone
Lost all its pieces but the pawn
Tomorrow stopped coming with the dawn
In my dreams, I've seen
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
When it's over there's no walking out
'cause I've been all they talk about
'cause what ain't goin' down
On Main Street
I went too early with a friend of mine
just to see what it was all about
Hit the freeway and it blew my mind,
I had to find a way of gettin' out
She said, they say, hey you gotta live a little
In my mind, I'd find lost ain't living,
even there in the middle of Main Street
Yeah....
Never did the things I though I would
Woulda left just didn't know I could
If things don't work like they should
It ain't for better but it's for good
'cause in my dreams I've seen
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
When it's over there's no walking out
'cause I've been all they talk about
'cause what ain't goin' down
In my dreams I've seen
Things that only seem to happen on the silver screen
When it's over there's no walking out
'cause I've been all they talk about
'cause what ain't goin' down
On Main Street

For so long, I searched in desperation
For one love, that would always be true
I came close, but there were always complications
I finally decided there was nothing I could do
So I gave up
And I let go
And as soon as I did
Wouldn't you know
Just look what I found when I wasn't looking
Look what I found when I was just being me
I turned around and love was mine for the taking
Look what I found when she found me
Now there's a lot of lonely people out there waiting
And there's a lot of lonely people searching too
But if you've got too many expectations
You might miss the one who's right in front of you
No telling when
No telling why
She'll say hello and you'll know
You'll never say goodbye
Just look what I found when I wasn't looking
Look what I found when I was just being me
I turned around and love was mine for the taking
Look what I found when she found me
And every single day I'm still surprised
When I turn around and I look into her eyes
I'm a like a kid who won a prize
Look what I found
Just look at what I found
Just look what I found when I wasn't looking
Look what I found when I was just being me
I turned around and love was mine for the taking
Look what I found when she found me

I lost my fear in your arms
I lost my tears in your car
I lost my will in your candle lit eyes
And all my love in your yard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
Violent is the motion in my heart
And in my body and mind.
And silent is the feeling
That I lost but I'm determined to find.
And love is but an ocean,
Unrealistic notion,
But I cling to her devotion,
And I let it pull me down to the floor.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
I found my will in your car
I caught my tears in your arms
I found myself on that poor county drive
And found my love in your guard
Oh, Baby would you leave me if you knew
That I was making it up?
And underneath the love
You got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on.

Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key
Many parts an' many hearts
Been mismatched before
Still, they make delivery
Some folks send 'em back
An' never find what they need
But babe, my satisfaction's guaranteed
Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key
Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key
Sittin' tight an' sittin' proud
Waitin' on a shove
Passers by just keep on passin' by
I'll admit, I did a bit of passin' by myself
'Til I found a perfect fit
An' now I'm tied
Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
A perfect match as anyone can see
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key
You're the only lock made to fit my key

On a rainy, windy morning that's the day that I was born on
In the old sharecroppers one room country shack
They say my mammy left me, same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back
And I just thought I'd mention, my Grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning, living and a churning
Pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay
[Chorus]
I've been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wudn't born no yestday
Got a good Christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way
And now sweet Caroline, I don't guess I'll ever find
Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car
Yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine
[Chorus: x2]
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

Some got a boat they like to float
Some got a story they sugar coat
Some got a clue and then some don't
It takes all kinds
Some got a beer they like to drink
Some got a thought they like to think
Some got a chain with a few more links
It takes all kinds
That's what makes this world go around
You keep doing your thing, I'm doing mine right now
You've got a song, go on and sing it
Crank it up, rear back and bring it
I've got one, I think I'll swing it
It takes all kinds
Some wear a backwards baseball cap
If that's you, I'm cool with that
Me, I'm more a cowboy hat
It takes all kinds
That's what makes this world go around
You keep doing your thing, I'm doing mine right now
You've got a song, go on and sing it
Crank it up, rear back and bring it
I've got one, I think I'll swing it
It takes all kinds
Some like a dip in their bottom lip
They say, it's easier to spit
Me, I like a top lip dip
It takes all kinds
That's what makes this world go around
You keep doing your thing, I'm doing mine right now
Some say it is, some say it ain't
Some say we can, some say we can't
Winners, losers, sinners, saints
It takes all kinds
Some got a boat they like to float
Some got a clue and then some don't
Some got a beer they like to drink
Some got a thought they like to think
Some got a chain with a few more links
It takes all kinds

Although you mean and throw to me just like a fool won't set you free
I love you so oh don't you know it has to be
Although at times your love's not true though you've had friends
I know not who can't let you go, I love you so it has to be
Well, you can't be happy, no use to try, I wouldn't be satisfied
If you were gone and I was not by your side
Although the tears off dim my eyes, I'm not too fit to sit and cry
It's half a true it's only you, it has to be
Well, you can't be happy, no use to try, I wouldn't be satisfied
If you were gone and I was not by your side
Although the tears off dim my eyes, I'm not too fit to sit and cry
It's half a true it's only you, it has to be

Sitting in a cafe at the corner of Broad and Grand
Stirring up old memories and the coffee in my hand
The waitress stopped and asked me
Honey do you know what you want
I had to stop myself from telling her the truth
What I really need is another chance with you
But this temper train I'm on just ran away too fast
It's a long, long, way back to you baby
It's a long, long, way back
The neon clock is humming showing sign of wear
I've lost all sense of time since I've been sitting here
The waitress asked again
Is there something else you need
I need to take the hands off that clock above my head
Reset the time and take back everything I said
If I could turn around, then I would erase my tracks
But it's a long, long way back, to you baby
It's a long, long way back
It is a lonely road a fool travels down
I guess I oughta know 'cause that's where I'm headed now
And it's a long, it's a long, way back
Sitting at the cafe just Ruby Lee and me
I get feeling she's waiting on me to leave
She stopped askin' hours ago if I know what I want

I hear a call
Now will answer
Forsake my all
To serve another
Though darkness falls
Stay a believer
I hear a call
Now will answer
I see a light Now will I follow
Fill up this life
That grows more hollow
Make joy reside
Where there lives sorrow
I see a light
Now will follow
I hear a call
From out of nowhere
And from anywhere I go
I hear a call
Now will answer
I feel a touch
Now will I hold on
Be there with love
For those with no one
With a kindness such
It lives though I'm gone
I feel a touch
Now will I hold on

Oh it seems the sun will never shine
The skies are so gray and the heart you left broken is lonely
The winter wind blows through the trees and with the song I sing
I long for the days you loved me only
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new
Young hearts so tender in their yearning
But seasons, change and lovers too
And winter's twice as cold
But the fire in one heart is always burning
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain
And what was love is just a spell that's broken
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do
Seems our hearts have never really spoken
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart

Every morning as I start my day
I stop off at Ernie's Corner Stand
He sees me comin' from a half a block away
He's got my mornin' paper in his hand
He probably thinks I read it for the headlines
Just another never-get-enough news junkie
But I round that corner and in no time
Life section D's in hand
The rest is in a garbage can
I still read your horoscope
Cause I can't seem to give up hope
I've got to see what's up with Scorpio
Between that and Capricorn maybe I'll know
What you're goin' through
What I should do
Have you found someone new?
Are you going to?
Today it said that someone from your past
Would give you a call so well, "hi"
And if you feel old feelings comin' back
Don't be surprised it said you might
I know you probably think I'm crazy
Puttin' stock in the stars and the constellation
Ooh but ever since I lost you baby
It's the only thing that I can do
To feel like I'm keepin' up with you

If never I'd met you
I'd never have seen you cry
If not for our first hello
We'd never have to say goodbye
If never I held you
My feeling's would never show
It's time I start walkin'
But there's so much you'll never know
I keep telling you hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman
Rags, a sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love you
I can't forget about you
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
Before I go let me kiss you
And wipe the tears from your eyes
I don't wanna hurt you, girl
You know I could never lie
I keep telling you a hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
Rags, a sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love you
I can't forget about you
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, till you find your man
Hard luck woman
Hard luck woman
Hard luck woman
Hard luck woman

Well I won't make you tell me
What I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman and
I'm a different kind of man
I've tried to make you love me
You're tried to find a spark of the flame that burned and
Somehow turned to smoke ring in the dark
The loneliness within me
Takes a heavy toll
'Cause it burns as slow as whiskey through an empty aching soul and
The night is like a dagger
Long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps
Blowing smoke rings in the dark
I- I- I know I must be going
'Cause loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark
The rain falls where it wants to
Wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere
But I swear we're standin' still
So I'm not going to wake you
I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away
Like smoke rings in the dark

When the letter came this morning
Happy teardrops filled my eyes
It had a picture of a smiling face
And a ticket tucked inside
He didn't have to write one word
I understood it all
The picture said, "I love you"
And the ticket said, "Come home"
Well, the big ole wheels
Are turning as we roll on down the line
"Hey there, big conductor
Won't you get me there on time?"
The Kudzu vines are winding
Up the trees beside the road
The grass is getting greener
So we must be getting close
There he stands a-waiting
As the train pulls to the gate
There's so many things to ask him
But they're gonna have to wait
With cap in hand he stands there
Every hair is combed in place
His shiny boots reflecting
The big smile on his face
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Arm in arm he leads me
To his buckboard by the tree
Hand in hand we ride
To the house he built for me
He picks me up and gently
Carries me through the cabin door
Goodbye lonely hearts club
I don't need you anymore
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?

Waterfall
Nothing can go wrong
Nothing can go wrong
My sweet waterfall
When I go
When I go down deep
I want you here with me
My sweet waterfall
I can see
A rainbow calling me
Through your mystery
My sweet waterfall
Waterfall
For a million day
Fall with me for a million days
My sweet waterfall
Waterfall
Nothing can go wrong
Nothing can go wrong
My sweet waterfall
Nothing can go wrong
My sweet waterfall

In Canaan's land I'm on my way where the soul never dies
My darkest night will turn to day where the soul never dies
No sad farewell no tear dimmed eyes where all his love and the soul never dies
A rose is blooming there for me where the soul never dies
And I will spend eternity where the soul never dies
No sad farewell no tear dimmed eyes where all is loved and the soul never dies
A love light pinks across the throne where the soul never dies
It shines to light the shores of home where the soul never dies
No sad farewell no tear dimmed eyes where all his love and the soul never dies

I was thinking that love had turned its back on me
I was hurting inside in places that you can't see
Then I finally made up my mind just to let it go
That if love didn't want me, I didn't want love anymore
[Chorus]
That's when your light came shining
That's when your light came shining
That's when your light came shining on me
Once in a while, it could be any time of the day
I get this deep lonesome feeling that just won't go away
That's when I get to thinking, I'm losing control
And if it's gonna be like this, why should I try anymore?
[Chorus]
When darkness fall, shadows call and the blues hang around
Around my heart like a chain dragging me down
[Chorus: x2]

CHORUS:
Oh, how I love her, Little Liza Jane
Oh, how I love her, Little Liza Jane
Black my boots, and make em shine, Goodbye, oh Goodbye
Black my boots and make em shine, Goodbye Liza Jane.
Up hopped a chicken and he flew upstairs, Goodbye, Oh, Goodbye
Up hopped a chicken and he flew upstairs, Goodbye Liza Jane.
Scrapin up sand from the bottom of the sea, Goodbye, Oh, Goodbye
Scrapin up sand from the bottom of the sea, Goodbye Liza Jane.

REMEMBER THE GOOD
Writer Mickey Newbury
Yes, I suppose at times I think about her
She was once so much a part of me
Heaven knows I've learned to live without her
And hell, it was, at times, it was a painful memory
But for all it matters now, if it does
For all that I tried to be, but never was
For all the times I tried, I wouldn't change it if I could
For all she meant to me, I'll remember the good
I'll forget the bad
All the good times we've had, won' t make me quite so sad
When I'm remembering
And for all the times I tried, I wouldn't change it if I could
For all she meant to me, I'll remember the good
For all she meant to me, I'll remember the good

Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too
I don't know which one's to blame
For almost putting out our flame
But for me it's not the thing for us to do
The way it was
The way we were
Baby, you and me is where it was at
And I want
I want, us back
Girl, we've come too far for us
To give up on tomorrow
When we've shared so many good time yesterdays
If I know you like I think I do
I know that you don't want to lose
The me and you I'm dying to save
The way it was
The way we were
Baby, you and me is where it was at
And I want
I want, us back
I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want, I want
I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want (I want)
I want us back
Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too

Oh, somewhere the music's playing soft and low
And a stranger holds the one that I love so
I was blind I could not see that you meant the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go
Now I'm crying my heart out over you
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new
Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
For I'm crying my heart out over you
Each night I climb the stairs up to my room
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom
I miss your picture on the wall and your footsteps in the hall
While I'm crying my heart out over you
Now I'm crying my heart out over you
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new
Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
For I'm crying my heart out over you

A drunk man walking down a rainy street
A wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
You look down and suddenly you're looking up
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
A bald tire running on an icy road
A steep hill underneath a foot of snow
A greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
An ice cube hiding on your kitchen floor
A bad step leading up to your back door
How'd I wind up on my butt
Whoops, I slipped and feel in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
Help, I've fallen I can't getup
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love

Did I marry way too young
Did I think he was the one
Did I find out I was wrong
Yes I did
Have I watched my babies grow
Have I taught them all I know
Have I raised them all alone
Yes I have
All that I know is these are the places that I've been
Every mistake I made is a part of who I am
Was I a fool to always trust so much in love
Was I wrong, was I right
Yes I was
Did I wait tables all night long
Work my fingers to the bone
Did I struggle to be strong
Yes I did
Have I grown up way too fast
Have I learned from all my past
Have I found some peace at last
Yes I have
All that I know is these are the places that I've been
Every mistake I made is a part of who I am
Was I a fool to always trust so much in love
Was I wrong, was I right
Yes I was

The footprints over the snow
The fabric of all the lonely
C-Covering only
The fables and hands
The rest is out in the cold
Holding the last of the season
F-F-F freezin' yeah
My my my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My love like a voice.
We're walkin' in to the fields.
We're walkin in to the forest.
The moon is before us.
Up above
We're holdin' hands in the rain
S-sayin' words like I love you
D-d-d'you love me? Yeah
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my love like a voice
Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
Although we didn't make a sound.
There's nothing like finding gold
Within the rocks hard and cold
I'm so surprised to find more
Always surprised to find more
I won't look back anymore
I left the people that do
It's not the chase that I love
It's me following you.
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my heart like a kick drum
My my love like a voice
My my heart like a kick drum

Baby now I understand
How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know
Truth hopes lies will never show
Oh that love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
Honey I learned not to seek
Any promise hearts must keep after mine had come to know
And disappointedly so
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance
And though all those distant dreams
Seldom turn out what they seem in the rush to let them grow
Their loss had taught me to know
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance
Baby now I understand
How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know
Truth hopes lies will never show
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
Yeah love only pauses for a while and is always free to go

You were packed and ready to go
To your sister's back in Ohio
I knew you'd made up your mind
I couldn't stop you and you didn't want me to try
The door was open I watched you go
And I knew it was over but I didn't know
It could be that easy to walk away
It could be that easy to make a change
If the heart is willin' to start all over again
It was hard to believe but you showed me
It could be that easy
Three weeks of bein' alone has left me seeing
What I should've seen all along
Your love means so much more
Than I ever told you than I ever showed you before
Now the car is running
And there's a sign out on the lawn
I'm packed and ready
To give up everything I own
It could be that easy to walk away
It could be that easy to make a change
If the heart is willing to start all over again
It was hard to believe but you showed me
It could be that easy
It could be that easy to make a change
Build a new tomorrow from yesterday
If the heart is willin' to start all over again
Oh then so can we, oh you gotta believe
It could be that easy
Baby, it could be that easy

When summertime is gone and snow begins to fall
You can sing this song and say to one and all
You are my flower that's blooming in the mountain so high
You are my flower that's blooming there for me
So wear a happy smile and life will be worthwhile
Forget the tears but don't forget to smile
You are my flower that's blooming in the mountain so high
You are my flower that's blooming there for me

If I still had the heart to love
The way I used to love you
I might still have some trace
Of my identity
If I still had just half a mind
I'd call you up and ask you
Where you left the man
I used to be
'Cause I miss me
I'm not the same
Just someone else
Using my name
I wish you
Would come back soon
'Cause I miss me
I've been all up and down the roads
That lead to my old memories
But I can't find the one
With all my hopes and dreams
And I've been lookin' in my eyes
For something I still recognize
But some stranger's stare
Is all that I see
I miss me
I'm not the same
Just someone else
Using my name
I wish you
Would come back soon
'Cause I miss me
You've made me
A better man
That I've ever thought I'd be
And now that you're gone
I can't move on
'Cause I miss me
I'm not the same
A little someone else
Using my name
I wish you'd come back soon
'Cause I miss me
I miss me

You Still Do That To Me
I never thought that I was good enough to have the love
Of a woman like you
But you showed me I was man enough with just a touch
In a way that only you could do
That's when my whole world started over you loved the fool right outta me
And honey, would you believe
You still do that to me
Chorus:
'Cause I still hold you in my arms when I dream at night and girl
I don't wake in the morning 'til ya' let me go
And in case I never told ya' you were my whole world
Honey, I wrote this song jut so you would know
Do you remember Jacksonville, 'cause I always will
No matter how hard I try to forget
I said a lot of hateful things that I didn't mean
And have a lifetime left of regret
That's when my whole world came crashin' down
Like a fool I went and let you leave
And it knocked me to my knees
You still do that to me
(Repeat Chorus)
So you would know
(Repeat Chorus)
That every time my heart beats
You still do that to me
Yeah honey, every time I breathe
You still do that to me
Every night, in my dreams
You still do that to me
Every time I think about you baby
You still do that to me
I still hold you, I still need you
When I'm sleepin' baby, that's when I see you
I still want you, I still need you
I still love you, you still do that to me
You still do that to me

[Chorus]
Back up buddy, don't you come any closer
I know you want her but the answer is 'No sir'
Back up buddy don't you come any closer, she's mine all mine
Oh buddy, I've seen you winking your eyes at the dolly I've got with me
I'll whittle you down to a punier size if you don't let her be
She's pretty and cute as a doll could be, she's a-loving and a-cuddling too
But her cuddlesome charms are only for me and not for the likes of you
[Chorus]
Oh buddy I've seen you making your play for the baby doll on my arm
You'd better back up and get out of my way, I'd hate to do you harm
I'll give you a hint that'll help you a lot, get a doll that's all your own
I'll give you most any thing I got but leave my baby alone
[Chorus]
I'm crazy in love and maybe that's why I'm a little bit jealous too
So back away boy, don't give her the eye, don't make me mad at you
I never have been the troublesome kind but it never too late to start
And trouble is what the joker will find that flirts with my sweetheart
[Chorus]
