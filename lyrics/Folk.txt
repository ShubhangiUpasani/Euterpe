When the day breaks and falls apart
That's my fanfare, my calling card
A run of bad luck, darkness at noon
I don't need the password to get to you
I'm a Venus Hunter
From another world
Ten thousand years
Since I've seen a girl
Burning petrol in my brain
What I called love you call insane
Some try wishing upon a star
Some try running, they don't get far
I'm a Venus Hunter
From another world
Ten thousand years
Since I've seen a girl

Looking around and around again
That's mean, oh that's mean
Far away on my own again
At gagans rye(? ) and tower hill
Silence sweet
Is there someone out there too?
Lies on on the twilight
It's me, you're home
Blue and grey, in season art
Another night at tower hill
Silence sweet
Is there someone out there too?
Silence sweet
Silence sweet
Is there someone out there too?
Stay in line and count to ten
Still here, right here
Moving round the center
I'm sorry now, at tower hill
Silence sweet
Is there someone out there too?

There's a crack in my memory,
As if something has gone
And split the foundation
Of shadow, of song
And raddled the windows,
And the tiny regrets
And the tiny glasses houses
That I tried to forget
Drink til your sleeping,
I love you that way
Like we are all babies;
All our beds are unmade
No memory has molded
Enough to forget
And our tiny glass houses
Are not built for us yet
Takes all of the courage,
And none of the pride,
To stand in the threshold-
To sit down inside
Where we are not babies;
No we are not new
And our tiny glass houses
With the beautiful view
There's a crack in my memory
Where a funeral parade,
Rolls through the doorway
That my memory made
And funeral marches
To its funeral sounds
And the tiny glass houses
Are all tumbling down
And tiny glass houses,
Are all tumbling down
And tiny glass houses,
Are all tumbling down

Starwalker he's a friend of mine
You've seen him looking fine
He's a straight talker, he's a Starwalker
Don't drink no wine
Ay way hey o heya
Wolf Rider she's a friend of your's
You've seen her opening doors,
She's a history turner, she's a sweetgrass burner
And a dog soldier
Ay hey way hey way heya
Lightning Woman, Thunderchild
Star soldiers one and all oh
Sisters, Brothers all togheter
Aim straight, Stand tall
Starwalker is a friend of mine
You've seen him looking fine
He's a straight talker, he's a Starwalker
Don't drink no wine
Ah way hey o hey...

Hounds are broodin' in my bones
But I am a good dog runnin' halfway home
Hear the lonely promenade
Come to nurse the tender terrways
All hands on a grain of sand
Half smallest things are the high demand
I can only serenade
And wait my turn to burn or fade
All colors you can see
Cover the borders of a masterpiece
Time can paint the best of me
Over the unclear eyes of memory
Cover love from sympathy
Be my maker, set me free
Truer hearts could not contain
How I cover love but I have not changed

Chorus:
I let you see a side of me
And now there's a fire in my head
Can't calm it down or put it out
I guess its the way it's supposed to be
Verse 1:
Now I'm a victim of my own incarceration
Treated like a criminal but also like a patient
Can't make it through one evaluation
Without the guidance of a little bad persuasion
Now you opened up a side of me
That no one controls and my mind is free
One side's just filled with hate
And that side's alive and inside of me
So if you're strong enough, let's push it back in me
Suppress all the pain
Otherwise they'll be another casualty
Chorus
Verse 2:
There's a fire pent in me
And I don't even really want the world to see
How it burns so bright when you around
I try to get up but I get knocked down
How is it possible that you could be just another obstacle
Flipping the switch now I'm off the wall
If life is a game I need an audible
Go silent and drift away
Go find your gift today
That gift of love and hate
And push 'til it feels like your head'll break
Don't make the same mistakes
It's too hot when we touch the flames
It's so sad when the lives are claimed
I should be ashamed that I
Chorus
Bridge:
This fire in my head,
This fire in my
This fire in my head
this fire in my
Head.

I can still see mama stooped around those cotton stalks.
If she picked one, she picked a hundred bales.
Me and all my brothers would take turn about,
Dragging mama's sack up to the scales.
While little baby sister slept in peaceful sleep.
Mama laid her in the trailer shade.
Daddy was in Danville working for the railroad.
When he was coming home we couldn't wait
.
These are just some things I want to sing about
Memories I can't live without.
Diamonds buried deep down in my mind.
Thoughts I can't quit thinking,
A fountain I'll keep drinking from,
And a taste that's gettin' sweeter all the time.
[ Break]
I remember thinking town was where Grandmother's lived.
Where brothers went to catch a bus or train.
A treasured thought was daddy grinnin' ear to ear
Every time we'd hear the old Chuck Wagon Gang.
Among the many things I can't forget about,
Was seeing mama bowed in silent prayer.
I turned and left her slowly, without her ever knowing
There was ever anybody there.

Ive got a love - Ive got a love
Open my hand and make a jump
Im on a train its overrun
I fought like its not the only one.
Why could you go, where could you stay,
Ill die on my feet an Ill pass away
Grippin the rope in days just gone
And shoeing the bones for evryone.
And these are hard times to fall in love
These are hard times to fall in love
Oh I fell upon a hard hard mile
Shoed me some bones to stake my time
And I gunned for your love right through the sun
Shoeing the bones for evryone.
And these are hard times to fall in love
These are hard times to fall in love
And these are hard hard times
These are hard hard times

Lost child only wants to find a place
where he can fit in and play
Rain cloud hovers all around
his head he's hidden away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
A black rose grows in the city garden, hidden away
Despite not finding the proper sunlight, she finds a way
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away, oh
Lost child hungry for a celebration, sits upon a stone
Left with only his imagination, still a party is thrown
Through all this pain oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain oh I can see there's gonna be a celebration day, oh

I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a Jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene laundries
Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly by her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
In the streaming stains
Of the Magdalene laundries
Prostitutes and destitutes
And temptresses like me
Fallen women
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery
Why do they call this heartless place
Our Lady of Charity?
Oh charity!
These bloodless brides of Jesus
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene laundries

Sally Jane, how did it end up this way
With our boxes packed and not one word to say?
The children play as your car pulled away
I didnt realize til then it was really goodbye
With your wheels on the gravel
I felt my heart strings unravel
As it started to rain, it started to rain
It started to rain, forty days, it started to rain
The neighbors came and they bought what remained
Of the life we built with loving, with laughter
And my heart started sinking cause I couldnt help thinking
Their fate would be the same, it started to rain
It started to rain, forty days, it started to rain
It started to rain, it started to rain

I don't want to introduce you to my friends
'Cause I think they'll get the wrong idea
You're so fetching in that dress
They'll think that we have messed around
And though I'll tell them otherwise
I was gone all night with you
What most people do
Will be running through their heads
They don't need to see
That I met a pretty girl last night
I'm nineteen
And I've kissed two girls, that's all
You're sixteen
And your one is that against the law?
I never thought that it would come to this
My reputation will be missed by all the dads
That introduce me to their girls
Saying I have got a great idea
You're so different from most guys
Now that's just a wishful lie
Because I am not different anymore
A revolving door you came through
And though you're first even if your last
Won't change that I'm not me
'Cause I met a pretty girl last night
I guess, I have to introduce you to my friends
But I know they'll get the wrong idea

Oh the neon lights were flashin'
And the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes
And the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead
And the wine was runnin' low
And the old man came home
From the forest
His tears fell on the sidewalk
As he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare
But no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway
And the bottle was his friend
And the old man stumbled in
From the forest
Up a dark and dingy staircase
The old man made his way
His ragged coat around him
As upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened
That he ended up this way
Getting lost like a fool
In the forest
And as he lay there sleeping
A vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining
A face of one so dear
Who had loved him in the springtime
Of a long-forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom
In the forest
She touched his grizzled fingers
And she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound
Of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside
In some forgotten town
Where the river runs down
From the forest
With a mighty roar the big jets soar
Above the canyon streets
And the con men con but life goes on
For the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier
The dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home
From the forest

In a land of O'Cahan where bleak mountains rise
O'er those brown ridgy tops now the dusky clouds fly
Deep sunk in a valley a wild flower did grow
And her name was Finvola, the Gem of the Roe
For the Isles of Abunde appeared to out view
A youth clad in tartan, it's strange but it's true
With a star on his breast and unstrung was his bow
And he sighed for Finvola the Gem of the Roe
The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
And he sighed for Finvola
The Gem of the Roe
To the grey shores of Alba his bride he did bear
But short were the fond years these lovers did share
For thrice on the hillside the Banshee cried low
Twas the death of Finvola the Gem of the Roe
The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
Twas the death of Finvola
The Gem of the Roe
No more up the streamlet her maidens will hie
For wan the pale cheek and bedimmed the blue eye
In silent affliction our sorrows will flow
Since gone is Finvola the Gem of the Roe
The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
Since gone is Finvola
The Gem of the Roe

Someday I won't need this crutch that carries me
And I'll be so complete but these thoughts weigh me down
Cripple my hopes and dreams, please just leave me be
No stay and watch me beg and plead
Tell me what you need, tell me everything
Am I only the air when you need to breathe?
Save me from this long night alone and let me start again
For when I wake up and see you lying next to me
I'm blessed with a cure or a scent that never really fades
It's a vicious cycle, it spins
An eye for an eye, not of the beholder it was in
But things only get worse and I only meant well
At least I thought I did
Am I only the air when you need to breathe?
Am I only a window when you, when you need to see?
It never really fades, it never really fades away
When all you know is nothing at all
And the strings that hold you are bursting undone
You can't pretend that it's right when it's completely wrong
It's wrong
Save me from this long night alone and let me start again
For when I wake up and see you lying next to me
I'm blessed with a cure or a scent that never really fades
I'd hoped it never come to this
A simple slap on the wrist surely would suffice enough
And take me back to the start

I wish I was on yonder hill

And every tear would turn a mill
I'll sell my rod, I'll sell my reel
I'll sell my only spinning wheel
To buy my love a coat of steel

I once loved a lass
I loved her sae weel
I hated all others who spoke of her ill
But now she's rewarded me well for my love
For she's gone to be wed to another
I saw my love to the church go
With bridesgroom and bridesmaidens they made a fine show
And I followed on with my heart full of woe
She was gone to be wed to another
I saw my love sit down to dine
As I sat down beside her I poured out the wine
I drank to the lassie that should have been mine
Even though she'd been wed to another
The men o' the forest
They ask it o' me
How many strawberries grow in the south sea?
I answer them a' with a tear in my ee'
How many ships sail in the forest

Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart
Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic
Glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust
Circles the night
You can fly
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free
To spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart
Fly to the heights of all you can be
Soar on the hope of marvelous things
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free
To spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart

As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

How gentle was the breeze
That surrounded the way
How loud the sea's roar
On the four winds everyday
Sharing love,
Wounded gifts from ancient long ago
Together they closed in the circles we know
Will we treasure all the secrets
With lives changing scenes
Where our hearts were warm with love
So much love
Will the flowers grow again
As I open out my hand
Precious time
Time for healing
The beauty of this land
The beauty of this land
How soulful those words
That confuses the way
How wild the mountains stare
As they guard our everyday
Take for granted noble hearts
In the Golden Age that's flown
Between us recall on
A strong road we've known
Will we treasure all the secrets
With lives changing scenes
Where our hearts were warm with love
So much love
Will the flowers grow again
As I open out my hand
Precious time
Time for healing
The beauty of this land.

I was forced to wander because that I was poor
And to leave the hills of Caledonia seemed more than I could endure
And when that I was travellin oh what thought came to my mind
That I had never seen her beauty til she was far behind
Ferry me over, ferry me there
To leave the hills of Caledonia, is more than the heart can bear
When lost in distant days gone bywhere the simple joys I'd know
The foreign winds cried "Caledonia it's time you were goin home"
So I will find the tallest ship that's ever faced the foam
And I will sail to Caledonia for Caledonia's my home
cho Ferry me over, ferry me there
To leave the hills of Caledonia, is more than the heart can bear
By some friend or neighbor's side where the fires of love burn bright
With songs and stories I'll share my adventurin' until the mornin light
And should some young man ask of me "Is it brave or wise to roam"
I'd bid him range the wide world over the better to know his own home
I was forced to wander because that I was poor
And to leave the hills of Caledonia seemed more than I could endure
And when that I was travellin' oh what thought came to my mind
That I had never seen her beauty til she was far behind

As I came in by Auchindoun
A little wee bit frae the town
When to the Highlands I was bound
To view the Haughs of Cromdale
I met a man in tartan trews
I spiered at him, what was the news
Quo' he, "The Highland army rues
That ever we came to Cromdale"
"We were in bed, sir, every man
When the English host upon us came
A bloody battle then began
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale"
"The English horse, they were so rude
They bathed their hoofs in Highland blood
But our brave clans, they boldly stood
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale"
"But, alas, we could no longer stay
For over the hills we came away
And sore we do lament the day
That ever we came to Cromdale"
Thus the great Montrose did say
"Can you direct the nearest way?
For I will over the hills this day
And view the Haughs of Cromdale"
"Alas, niy, Lord, you're not so strong
You scarcely have two thousand men
And there's twenty-thousand on the plane
Stand rank and file on Cromdale"
Thus the great Montrose did say
"I say, direct the nearest way
For I will over the hills this day
And see the Haughs of Cromdale"
They were at dinner, every man
When the great Montrose upon them came
A second battle then began
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The Grant, Mackenzie and M'Ky
Soon as Montrose they did espy
Oh, then they fought most valiantly
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The M'Donalds, they returned again
The Camerons did their standard join
M'Intosh played a bloody game
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The M'Gregors fought like lions bold
M'Phersons, none could them control
M'Lauchlins fought like loyal souls
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
M'Leans, M'Dougals and M'Neils
So boldly as they took the field
And made their enemies to yield
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The Gordons boldly did advance
The Frasers fought with sword and lance
The Grahams they made the heads to dance
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The loyal Stewarts with Montrose
So boldly set upon their foes
And brought them down with Highland blows
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
Of twenty thousand Cromwell's men
Five hundred fled to Aberdeen
The rest of them lie on the plain
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale

I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside
But I was young and able
When I came out the other end
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble
Unreadable
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
I thanked him
A face of white, a face of brown
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger
For a stranger
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me"
I came down to live alone in New York
The city of the living
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men
Were taking, none we giving
Or forgiving
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
I saw them
There were men who lived in style and others who had died
Where no one knew them
Beause they couldn't win
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms
Where babies crept unwanted
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope
Or if it mattered what they did
Or if they lived
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me"
I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
And there were prophets in the squares
And people there who smiled and said, "Forget it"
There were lovers in the park
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it
So afraid of it
And there were preachers of the Word and poets
Who were never heard, I heard them
There were those who would not try to learn
The measure of the lie they're livin'
I heard a young musician play in a place
Where they paid you not to listen
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by
And offered their best wishes
That's how it is
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me"
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me"
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me"

It was on a fine summer's morning
The birds sweetly tune on each bough
And as I walked out for my pleasure
I saw a maid milking a cow
Her voice was so enchanting, melodious
Left me quite unable to go
My heart, it was loaded with sorrow
For the pretty maid milking her cow
Then to her I made my advances
"good morrow most beautiful maid
Your beauty my heart so entrances"
"pray sir do not banter," she said
"i'm not such a rare precious jewel
That I should enamour you so
I am but a poor little milk girl,"
Says the pretty maid milking her cow
The indies afford no such jewel
So bright, so transparently clear
I do not add things to my funeral
Consent but to know me my dear
Oh, had I the lamp of aladdin
Or the wealth that gold mines can bestow
I'd rather be poor in a cottage
With the pretty girl milking her cow.

With the sunlight through
Departed into darkness
I need someone too
A fantasy and you
Now is here
Here is now
Nah-na-na-nah-nah
You inspire
Me somehow
Nah-na-na-nah-nah
With the words like air
A destiny we shared
Is a dream come true
A fantasy and you
Now is here
Here is now
Nah-na-na-nah-nah
You inspire
Me somehow
Nah-na-na-nah-nah

Green are your eyes
In the morning, when you arise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know
Love can be broken
Though no words are spoken
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know
Love be bold
We're not so old
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know
Love don't cry
I'll not try
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Black day in July
Motor city madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside
Black day in July
Black day in July
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land
Black day in July
Black day in July
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavement
No reason can be found
Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And the people rise in anger
And the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops
And the blood begins to spill
Black day in July
In the mansion of the governor
There's nothing that is known for sure
The telephone is ringing
And the pendulum is swinging
And they wonder how it happened
And they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature
And it wasn't just the season
Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake
And everyone is listening
And everyone's awake
Black day in July
Black day in July
The printing press is turning
And the news is quickly flashed
And you read your morning paper
And you sip your cup of tea
And you wonder just in passing
Is it him or is it me
Black day in July
In the office of the President
The deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see
It looks to us like anarchy
And then the tanks go rolling in
To patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate
The speech is made the dues can wait
Black day in July
Black day in July
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings
Strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen
And you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers
Why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the have-nots
Keep falling out of reach
Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor city madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside

Cold, blue eyes, they look through me
Stare those eyes at me
You must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs
Yes, you must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs
There's no disguise upon your face
You're not like anyone I know
They give so freely and they come when I come out
But you're the one, the one I want to understand
You must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs
Yes, you must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs
You're not scared, no, you don't answer
You just stand there, face the stairs going home
If I could choose my own way down
I'd take the road to the blackstairs
You must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs
Sadness raging in the broken man
Stays until the day ends
When he is free to think of better days again
Looks like the scales of love and time are all the same
You must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs
And I long to go up there
And live on the blackstairs
Yes, you must be one of those girls
Who live on the blackstairs

It's the same old story that I've heard 10 times before
You're sending your love to war
With a doctor and a locked up door
You only learned to pack it up a year ago at the corner store
Where the bandage made your blood run boiled
And you're running cause you're so hardcore
Chours:
And all the ladies dance and swoon
To the tango tune
By the big pi moon?
Oh while your brothers warn each other with their lavish lyric tunes
Oh lover never loved me though I do
And said the doctor to your heart you never ever should have come so far
You couldn't blame it on your new guitar
You wouldn't play it at the whisky bar
And it's been 24 years running up and down the wrong side of
The streets you lived on were not made for love
Write a letter, send a war cry dove
CHORUS
Yes I do have your picture in my car
Where I dream that I'm driving fast and far
And I do want you badly like I said so
Oh whoa when I dreamed how I loved you soft and slow
But never mind the invitation it was all a form of so and so
And we've both had enough of stop and go
And now you wish you'd never said hello
Until we're back into the station where the radio is blaring on
And all the war brides sing their soldiers songs
The night is sure dear but the love is long
CHORUS

I first met you down on lover's lane
You were just like an angel
With angel golden wings
We walked along we sang a song
The birds were singing too
It seems like heaven here on earth
Just to be again with you
You're just the girl of my dreams;
It seems that my dreams
Never come true
At night we'd sit out on the old porch swing
Stars were shining brightly
Softly you would sing
You'd sing of happy days gone by
It makes me happy too
It'd be like heaven here on earth
If I could be with you
You're just the girl of my dreams;
It seems my dreams
Never come true
I first met you down on lover's lane
You were just like an angel
My little brown eyed Jane
We walked along we hummed a song
The birds were singing too
It'd be like heaven here on earth
Just to be again with you
You're just the girl of my dreams;
It seems that my dreams
Never come true
You're just the girl of my dreams;
It seems that my
Dreams never come true

[Chorus:]
She's your granny, she's your granny
She's your granny, the hag with the money
She's your granny from the town of Iorrais Mr
And she would put coaches on the roads of Cois Farraige
If you'd see the steam boat going past Tin U Loing'
And the wheels turning speedily at her flanks
She'd scatter the store nine times to the rear
But she never keeps pace with the hag with the money
[Chorus]
Do you reckon he'd marry, do you reckon he'd marry
Do you reckon he'd marry the hag with the money?
I know he'll not marry, I know he'll not marry
Because he's too young and he'll drink the money
[Chorus]
We'll soon have a wedding, we'll soon have a wedding
We'll soon have a wedding by two in the village
We'll soon have a wedding, we'll soon have a wedding
Between San Seamais Mor and Maire Ni Chathasaigh

[Chorus twice]

"Oh rise up my darling and come with me
I want to go with you and leave this country
To leave my fathers dwelling, this house and the land
So away goes Jamie with his love in his arms
They go over hills and the mountains and glens
Traveling all through the night in the mist in the rain
But her father has followed and has taken his men
And he captured poor Jamie with his love in his arms
Now home she was taken to her room she is bound
While poor Jamie lies on the cold stoney ground
And he knows all the while before the judge he will stand
For the stealing of nothing but his own true love's hand
In the cold hard iron his hands they are bound
Handcuffed like a murderer and tied to the ground
And the goaler tells Jamie "last night I did hear
That your Lady will hang you or else set you clear"
The judge says "this young girl being tender in youth
If Jamie is guilty she will tell the truth"
Then the radiant beauty before him did stand
"Oh I'm happy to see you my bold Irish lad"
But the father cries out "Lord have pity on me
For the man came to bring disgrace to my family
And he stole my only daughter, all part of his plan
And if you don't hang him I will quit the land"
But the daughter is crying and begging is she
"The fault isn't Jamie's the blame lies with me
I forced him to leave and run away with me
And I'll die if I can't save my bold Jamie"
"Good Lord he has stole all her jewels and her rings
Gold watches and amber, all my precious things
And it costs me a fortune in thousands of pounds
And I'll take the life of Jamie before I lie in the ground
"Good Lord I gave them as a token of love
An when we are parted I'll have them removed
But a true lovers token wear on your right hand
And think of me darling when you're in a foreign land"

You are not alone
I will always be with you
Even to the end
You don't have to work so hard
You can rest easy
You don't have to prove yourself
You're already mine
You don't have to hide your heart
I already love you
I hold it in mine
So you can rest easy
Do not be afraid
Nothing, nothing in the world
Can come between us now
You don't have to work so hard
You can rest easy
You don't have to prove yourself
You're already mine
You don't have to hide your heart
I already love you
I hold it in mine
So you can rest easy
You work so hard to wear yourself down
And you're running like a rodeo clown
You're smiling like you're scared to death
You're out of faith and all out of breath
You're so afraid you've got nowhere left to go
Well, you are not alone
I will always be with you
You don't have to work so hard
You can rest easy
You don't have to prove yourself
You're already mine
You don't have to hide your heart
I already love you
I hold it in mine
You can rest easy

My garden is surrounded on all sides
By wrought iron, you can scale it if you try
Cause there's an oak tree with sturdy limbs
That you can climb and lower yourself in
And my garden is a little over grown
Cause it's been years since last the grass was mown
And the thistles well they come up past your ears
All my insecurities and fears
And my garden isn't doing so well these days
All my vegetables all wither and decay
And my flowers are wilted dying things
And those thistles are the undisputed king
And I slipped under the full moon
And I saw the end coming soon

Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica.
Columbus made history thinking some island was India.
General Custer's a national hero for not knowing when to run.
All these men are famous, and they're also very dumb.
History is made by stupid people.
Clever people wouldn't even try.
If you wanna place in the history books,
Then do something dumb before you die.
Nobility are famous for no reason.
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake.
She cause a Revolution when she would not share.
And her husband lost his head for that mistake.
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin.
Her makers made a minor oversight.
Before they filled it up with explosive gas
They should have fixed the no smoking light.
'Cause!
History is made by stupid people.
Clever people wouldn't even try.
If you wanna place in the history books,
Then do something dumb before you die.
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!
Our king and country's honor we will save.
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!
We're marching into history and the grave.
So, if your son or daughter seem too lazy,
Sitting there watching MAD T.V.
Just remember you should be quite grateful
At least they're not making history.
Ahhh!
History is made by stupid people.
clever people wouldn't even try.
If you wanna place in the history books,
Then do something dumb before you die.
Do something dumb before you die
Do something dumb before you die!!

Oh draw near each young lover,
Give ear to my story
That bears my sad, mournful tale.
Come join me in chorus
And lend me your pity,
While I my misfortune bewail.
The grief my poor heart
No tongue can disclose.
My cheeks are now pale,
They once bloomed like the rose.
And it's all for a young man,
Whom I do suppose
Is now far from sweet Erin the Green.
Now when were children
We walked out together
Along the green meadows sweet.
And although we were childish
We loved one another
Whilst gathering the wild berries sweet.
It was to sweet Garvagh where we were sent to school,
He was first in his class
And correct in each rule.
And I cheerfully walked home by Kilnacoole
With the flower of sweet Erin the Green.
Oh his head on my breast
And he used to repose
At each evening under the shade.
A song in my praises my darling composed
And he styled me the cool Derry maid.
At the time I denied him I'd die for his sake,
It was little I thought my denial he'd take.
Oh, but my own misfortune
I made a mistake
When he left me on Erin the Green.

I had a love that was so bright
I used to dream of her each night
And then rush to her side every morning (oooh)
I had her all to myself
We never noticed anyone else
We didn't even hear the radio warnings
Our love was no joke, you know
It was the talk of downtown Tokyo
We'll be happy forever, I promised her
But just as I proposed, her feet
Were made to touch her nose
As she was crushed by a Japanese monster
(ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-AAAAAAGH! GODZILLA!)
Our love was so true
But now she's 3 foot 2
And she used to be 5 foot 11
Her death was unintentional
But now she's 2-dimensional
My angel is truly in heaven
She's the one I kiss and hug
Till she was crushed like a bug
I guess it's hard to see a monster above you
She said she'd save her heart for me
But now it's there for all to see
And her last words to me were, "I AAAAAGGHH!"
Our love was so true
But now she's 3 foot 2
And she used to be 5 foot 11
Her death was unintentional
But now she's 2-dimensional
My angel is truly in heaven
(Take it George!)
[Guitar solo consisting entirely of glissandos]
She was young (so young)
And sweet (so sweet)
But now she's part (she's part)
Of the street (the street)
And I want (so much)
To have her back (come back)
So I'll get a putty knife
So I can scrape her from the crack
(Oh. You might need a wider brush.)
Our love was so true
But now she's 3 foot 2
And she used to be 5 foot 11
Her death was unintentional
But now she's 2-dimensional
My angel is truly in heaven
My angel is truly in heaven
My angel is truly in heaven

My song for you this evening
Is not to make you sad
Nor for adding to the sorrows
Of this troubled northern land
But lately, I've been thinking
And it just won't leave my mind
I'll tell you about two friends one time
Who were both good friends of mine
Isaac, he was Protestant
And Sean was Catholic born
But it never made a difference
For the friendship, it was strong
And sometimes in the evening
When they heard the sound of drums
They said, they won't divide us
We will always be as one
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
It was on a Sunday morning
When the awful news came 'round
Another killing had been done
Just outside Newry town
We knew that Isaac danced up there
We knew he liked the band
But when we heard that he was dead
We just could not understand
Now fear, it filled the countryside
There was fear in every home
When late at night, a car came
Prowling 'round the Ryan Road
A Catholic would be killed tonight
To even up the score
Oh Christ, it's young Macdonald
They have taken from the door
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
Isaac was my friend, he cried
He begged them with his tears
But centuries of hatred
Have ears that do not hear
An eye for an eye
That was all that filled their minds
And another eye for another eye
Till everyone was blind
Now I don't know where the moral is
Or where the song should end
But I wonder just how many wars
Are fought between good friends
And those who give the orders
Are not the ones to die
It's Scott and young Macdonald
And the likes of you and I
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together

Gas Chambers...
Leading me down where the orchestras play...
The destruction...and symphonies
Violent songs to me....
The violent games that we play.....
Building castles in my mind.
Trebuchets in my eyes...
Monster! When you're out of line...
And the shrouds you build
doesn't make any sense at all....
And I hold it in....And I held it in....Just hold it in....
In my eyes, I'm not there.
Look at me! They've taken everything away from me.
In my eyes, I'm not there.
Look at me! They've taken everything away from me.
Take your pills!
I watched you build your barricades....
Now you look afraid....Tell me how you really feel!
Covered in white....I've been down for too long.
Now I'm ready to fight....So hollow inside!
And I hold it in....And I held it in....Just hold it in....
In my eyes, I'm not there.
Look at me! They've taken everything away from me.
In my eyes, I'm not there.
Look at me! They've taken everything away from me.
Taken everything away from me....Taken everything away from me....
Just give me space!
Let me feel everything! I'm tired of feeling this way.
God made me this way.... How can you judge anything?
You don't even know, you're not me! and I'm not there....
(no longer there)
In my eyes, I'm not there.
Look at me! They've taken everything away from me.
In my eyes, I'm not there.
Look at me! They've taken everything away from me.
Taken everything away from me....Taken everything away from me....

Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star
I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star
The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star
Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star
I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star
I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star

Like mighty ships that sail the Atlantic foam
The Skellig Isles parade the Kerry Coast
It's a strange place with the needle's eye
Where shipwrecks lie
Where the king of the world rested for a while
And a place for the pilgrim, a sanctuary of time
Fourteen steps to nowhere, out of solid stone
Don't lead us to the Heavens or lead us to the sea
The Vikings came to plunder and destroy
But to this day the holy relics stand
In a blind mans cove, where the wailing woman sigh
And the seagulls cry
Where the king of the world rested for a while
And a place for the pilgrim, a sanctuary of time
Fourteen steps to nowhere, out of solid stone
Don't lead us to the Heavens or lead us to the sea
A journey to these islands, so rare
The sound of screaming souls that fill the air
A thousand wings, against the sky
And gray seals disguised
Where the king of the world rested for a while
And a place for the pilgrim, a sanctuary of time
Fourteen steps to nowhere, out of solid stone
Don't lead us to the Heavens or lead us to the sea

It was one fine March morning, I bid New Orleans Adieu
And I took the road to Jackson Town, my fortune to renew
I cursed all foreign money, no credit could I gain
Which filled my heart with a longing for, the Lakes of Ponchartrain
I stepped on board of a railroad car beneath the morning sun
I rode the rods till evening and I laid me down again
All strangers there no friends to me 'til a dark girl towards me came
And I fell in love with the Creole Girl, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain
I said "Me pretty Creole Girl, me money here's no good,
If it weren't for the alligators, I'd sleep out there in the wood"
"You're welcome here kind stranger, from such sad thoughts refrain"
"For me Mammy welcomes strangers, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain"
She took me into her mammy's house and treated me right well
The hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell
To try and paint here beauty, I'm sure i't would be in vain
So handsome was my Creole girl by the Lakes of Ponchartrain
I asked her if she'd marry me, she said that ne'er could be
For she had got a lover and he was far at sea
She said that she would wait for him and true she would remain
Till he'd return to his Creole girl, on the Lakes of Ponchartrain
It's fare thee well, me Creole girl, I'll never see you more
I'll never forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore
And at each social gathering, a flowing bowl I'll drain
And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain

I'm goin' to saddle up me old grey mare,
I'm goin' to ride through the night,
Without a worry or a care.
I'm a messenger boy, bringing my love to you.
I see the light in the bedroom,
I pray to God that I didn't come too soon.
Two big dogs and a man shouts "Who goes there ?"
I've ridden through the cold and the wind and the rain and the frost,
And the snow and I'm love and I do not feel the pain.
I'm a messenger boy, bringing my love to you.
(Fade out / ad lib vocals etc)
(gd/naas)

I don't know if I can do this alone
Oh, after all our sweet love is flown
I've been a running, I've been skipping like a stone
And I don't know if I, I can do this alone
When I met her, she was standing by a door
I ain't never seen a light like that before
Now she's left me for something more sure
And I don't know if I, I can do this anymore
Lovers will come, lovers will go
This rare seed are from which true love might grow
And if you see her, won't you please say, hello
'Cause I don't know if I can do this alone

At a quarter to midnight lays a cornerstone
You can read by the moonlight aloud and alone
And from over your shoulder it's courting your soul
Does it tell you your fortune or say nothing at all
In your dreams your montana skies
In your dreams your a ruby and sapphire prize
In your eyes something to see
In your eyes pastures of green
In the company quarter the company store
Stays making the bargain that it made before
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets bring that company down
In history wayfaring armies
Cavalries above and beyond
Some were made of mothers own babies
Some were made of mothers own young
In a small dark alley where the sun won't go
There's got to be something maybe diamonds and pearls
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets find that dark alley out
Oh mystery gem of the moment
Chivalry got lost in your smile
Some may say there's nothing to comment
Some may stay silent awhile

I will not forget all the things, I haven't said yet
And so I'll wait
Like water thrown on water, its always hard to tell
Just where is ends
Getting ready to be strung, there is sweetness to
Every blow
Broken bridges, wish I could lie down
Freedom angels come and save me now
So I lost my fortune then found it in a glen
Trees and branches led me straight to him
Oh my love, freedom caused us shame
On the breeze, your words call again
Will we learn to wait until tomorrow
Not knowing where we'll go
Broken bridgesm selfish now it sounds
Thirsty whispers told me to find out
Well I tried to stay until the summer came
Winter madness running through my veins
Oh my love, freedom caused us shame
On the breeze you words call again
Will we learn to wait until tomorrow
Not knowing where we'll go
You say
Words don't mean a thing
You say
Words don't mean a thing

(Sandy Denny)
They stood upon the deck
As the ship went out to sea
The wind it took the sails
And left the land a memory
All upon the shore for
To wonder why the sailor goes
All to close their eyes
And wonder what the sailor knows
That is you to they
That is how they think you are
Never on the land
But sailing by the north star
That is you to them
That is how they think you are
Never on the land
But sailing by the north star
To the tower and to the ravens and
The tale that hopes they'll never leave
What if they should go?
We always dread to think of them
I wonder if they flew one day
And no one ever knew they'd gone
To circle over ships at sea
Claiming yet another son
That is you to me
That is where I think you are
Never on the land
But gone to find the north star

Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry.
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to Skye
Loud the wind howls
loud the waves roar
Thunderclaps rend the air
Baffled our foes
stand by the shore
Follow they will not dare
Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry.
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to Skye
Many's the lad fought on that day
Well the claymore did wield
When the night came
silently lain
Dead on Culloden field
Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry.
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to Skye
Though the waves heave
soft will ye sleep
Ocean's a royal bed
Rocked in the deep
Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head
Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing
Onward the sailors cry.
Carry the lad that's born to be king
Over the sea to Skye

It's the same old story
When someone astounds you
The harder they come
Yes the harder they fall
Takin' it easy
No matter what people say
And time will heal all your troubles away
(chorus)
I've got a notion
I might as well be closer to your heart
It's out in the open
I might as well be closer to your heart
Tossing and turning
And burning dreams across the night
(forever searching)
Silently waiting for such a long time
But will I know tomorrow
If you will be mine?
(repeat chorus)

Hello, it's been a long time since I have seen you here. With the look that's in your eyes, you've left behind your fear to step out on your own. Now the world will know who you were meant to be.
Come on and burn your bridges away, cause you know that we're not going back to where we have been. This road will show us there's a place where you and me can begin to say the things that we've been meaning to say. Now it's time to burn your bridges away.
Fading out with the daylight, the worry on your mind. Now the fight has turned to flight, but we'll make it out alive. So leave it all, let's go. Cause we'll risk everything we know to reach the other side.
We have just the lives we lead to show this world what we believe - find out now who you will be.

This may come as a surprise
But I've got x-ray eyes
And I can see the skull
Beneath the skin
Though you do not realize
I can read what's in your mind
And I know you're not so
Attached to him
Celestine, don't lie to me
Celestine, don't lie, don't lie
You may not understand
I don't need to lay on hands
I already know exactly
How you feel
You don't have to say a word
It's your heatbeat I have heard
Getting louder now across
The space between
I know what you're thinking
So you don't have to say
Stranger things can happen
They happen every day
I've got special information
I don't need to be told
But I need insight into your soul

Now that your darlin' keeps you home
There goes the best war we've ever had
Now that nobody's all alone
We'll turn forgiveness to forget
If you're in town you'll look me up
And dance the days into the cups
And you will talk of golden river flow
And given you enough
Bye, bye, years
Of deals and dolls
Bye, bye, Montreal
What wicked patterns we succumb
From the warnings we have run
Now from a figure we have cut the mold
And filled the stadium

'Tis the last rose of summer
Left blooming alone.
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flowerer of her kindred
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.
I'll not leave thee thou lone one
To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
So soon may I follow
When friendships decay
And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown
Oh! Who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?

I think I've got a crush on Celine Dion
The way she beats her chest when she sings a love song
There's something about her makes me want to feed her
And I'd love to be Mister Celine Dion
She'll sing a song in English, and she'll sing en francais
Both the songs will suck, but I love her anyway
She's full of emotion, I'm full of devotion
For Celine and I'll be hers someday
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world
Won't you please be mine Celine
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl
Oh, be my girl Celine
I sent you cards and letters, but you don't respond
You play hard to get, but my heart goes on and on (and on and on, etc...)
I just wanna say, je aimerez
And I can see your house from my van
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world
Won't you please be mine Celine
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl
Oh, be my girl Celine
Celine Celine
Her skin's so soft and clean
Just like porcelain
I wish she'd slather me
With a tub of Vaseline
(That was a little creepy) I'm sorry, Celine
Celine Celine
Celine Dion

Hi kids!
Welcome to the Uncle Bobo show!
Are you ready to sing?
Come on, let's go!
Billy and his family went on a holiday
They went down to Florida to laugh and dance and play
Bill went in for a swim, he didn't see the harm
But when he came back out again, he was short an arm
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy and his father went out to play some catch
But Billy missed the pass because his arm was unattached
The ball flew past his shoulder and it rolled into the swamp
When he went wading after it his leg became a stump
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy and his father joined a three-legged race
They were tearing up the field, no one could keep the pace
But Billy tripped and did a flip and landed in the muck
He was running out of limbs and also out of luck
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy was all dirty, he really had to wash
But he couldn't use a towel 'cause his limbs had been gnawed off
He went into the water to get all clean and bright
But when his bath was finished he was only half his height
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy's father rolled his wheelchair up upon a hill
He wanted to put Bill where he would not get killed
But he left him on a slope, and into the swamp he rolled
They dragged out his head but there was nothing left below
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!

Why don't the mountains make me cry no more?
They don't sing the way they did before
They're just piles of stone
As dead as bones
Like corpses on a field of war
And they just don't make me cry no more
And the highway's like an old sad song
People moving through their lives alone
On the run from grace
From place to place
Like fugitives without a home
And the highway's like an old sad song
And my heart is black as coal
It's been mined and there ain't no gold
It's so dark in there
But I don't care
I will lay down in the this empty hole
Where my heart is black as coal
And oh, there is nowhere left to go from here
I have fallen past the last frontier
But at the bottom of this well I hear you breathing
Love below me
Love around me
Love above me
Love has found me
Love has found me here
So lay me down
Oh, lay me down in a field of golden
Lay me down
Oh, lay me down in a field of golden
Lay me down
(Love above, love below me)
Oh, lay me down in a field of gold and green

Love and Affection
You play games in the street
Who to trust and who to meet
Sweet justice hard to find
Say the same with deceit
Take no blame in defeat
Sweet justice hard to find
All I wanted was love and affection
All I wanted was love and affection
Lonely child roams around
As someone else goes underground
All trying to make ends meet
Trouble staring, is life so cheap?
All they wanted was love and affection
All they wanted was love and affection
Broken dreams in the street
True sensations, the stories leak
Sweet justice hard to find
Can't simply speak my mind
All I wanted was love and affection
All they wanted was love and affection
All I wanted was love and affection
And all they wanted was love and affection

There is a place on the east
Mysterious ring, a magical ring of stones
The druids have lived there once they said,
Forgotten is the race that no-one knows.
[Chorus]
Rum de rum 'rud a derimo
Rum de rum 'rud a derimo
The circled tomb of a different age
Secret lines carved on ancient stone.
Heroic kings laid down to rest
Forgotten is the race that no-one knows.
Wait for the sun on a winter's day
And a beam of light shines across the floor.
Mysterious ring, a magical ring.
But forgotten is the race that no-one knows.

I ran away from the black church on fire
golden and silver trees falling on me
their leaves just like tears of mercy
I reached the lake whose waters changed into ice
they tried to bury me
as a violet light
took me
a wild scream skinned inside
I looked around, myriads myriads of mirrows
all my images went out of their glass
showing me their hands a red cross stamped with
blood
I was the victim of a sacrifice
they tried to bury me
as a violet light
took me
a wild scream skinned inside

I envy the quiet lives that for all I know don't exist
Outside of a lazy book that won a Pulitzer prize
I picked up 'cause you said, it opened up your eyes
I'm wired now and will be 'til I find a person who could eat at the empire grill
Who's seen a black Mercedes at the textile mill
And spreads the word to all the folks expression hasn't killed
I'll follow that car down to Boston ask what it wanted in Maine
Coffee at least for my trouble
I'll be a hero if I came back with something to say
Too late, they wouldn't like me there
And though they might not mind my inquisitive stare
Every single one of them is too polite to care
Why I'm enchanted by a way of life in disrepair
I'm not talking apple pie eating, jack and coke drinking
Hopeful, lie telling, anywhere America, camera eyes
On a Hollywood body that could make you all cry
Maybe I'll go to the movies, a comedy would be ideal
Something that probably won't happen
'Cause this made up town is much too real
I envy the quiet lives that for all I know don't exist
Outside of a lazy book that won a Pulitzer prize
I picked up 'cause you said, it opened up your eyes

She's graceful to the eye
Elegant and tall
To see her walking by,
You'd think she had it all.
But I see her all the time now
A little red around the eyes now
Even so, it doesn't show
'Til I hear it in her words there
Just a little bit slurred there,
Then I know, I know,
[Chorus:]
That she's drinking again,
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
But she's drinking again
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
None of this is new
It all went down before
When she made it through
I thought she knew the score
But she's nothing left to hope with
And it's such a lot to cope with
Even still, I think she will,
She's trying really hard now,
But letting down her guard now
Until, until,
[Chorus]
She dreamed of being so fine,
She dreamed of having someone by her side
And even when her dream had died,
She dreamed that she could somehow make it right
Lipstick smudging her face
Hair all over the place
They say she's a disgrace
But they don't know
If she's drinkin' a lot
And if she says that she's not
Is she able to stop?
Well I don't know
[Chorus]

Hard to tell
Or recognize a sign
To see me through
A warning sign
First the thunder
Satisfied, if the past it will not lie
Then the storm
Torn asunder
The future you and I get blown away
In the storm
In a lifetime
And as the rain it falls
Begin again, as the storm breaks through
Heavy in my heart
Believe the light in you
So the light shines in you
Without color, faded and worn
Torn asunder in the storm
Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it disappears
First the thunder
Selfish storm
Then the storm
Hold on the inside
Torn asunder
One life
In the storm
In a lifetime
In a lifetime

The old days have gone that had use for a man
Who supported his laird-ship, protectin' his land.
Who in times of unrest, would have died for his lord
Now the soldiers of England have taken his broad sword.
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen!
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men...
And the laird has a smile for the makers of graves
For the builders of empires and the keepers of slaves
For he kept his great home losing nothing but pride
Though his kinsmen lay huddled along the shore-side...
And there's fire in the glen...
So beware of their banners and the general's lies
There's no glory for the poor man, no glittering prize
For we gave all we had, now our homes they fall down
And I cry out "Republic!" and allegiance to no crown.
And there's fire in the glen...
The old days have gone that had use for a man
Who supported his laird-ship, protecting his land
Who in times of unrest, he would have dies for his lord
Now the soldiers of England have taken his broad sword
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men

Lost touch, long ago,
It didn't end so well, I know
Lashed out, had a row
Don't know where home is for you now
Your drink should not have stayed undrunk
You should have drunk it down with your prayers
I showed no mercy to you then
No mercy when
Chorus
A glass unkissed by human lips
A glass untouched by human hands
A glass unbroken cut the skin
'till we bled
A glass unkissed by human lips
A glass untouched by human hands
A glass unbroken cut us both
'till we bled
Lost all in the end
Threw out the suffering of a friend
Let's hope life is kind
And will deliver peace of mind
Forgive this crazy one
Her crazey time in hell
She keeps her silence now
And means you well

My feet, they are naked, my hands on my hips
My eyes to the ocean, and open my lips
Ee-ah, oh, los pescadores
They come with a crash on the crest of a roar
And they're out of their boats and they're on to the shore
Ee-ah oh, los pescadores
And they wrench with the wave, and they strain with the rope
They dig in the sand and they bend to the smoke
Ee-ah, oh, los pescadores
And the weight of the men and the sound of the sea
The hardness of them and the softness of me
Ee-ah, oh, los pescadores

As I went home on Monday night,
As drunk as drunk could be.
I saw a horse outside the door,
Where my old horse should be.
I called my wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
Who owns that horse outside the door,
Where my old horse should be?
Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool,
Still you cannot see.
That's a lovely sow that my mother sent to me.
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,
But a saddle on a sow, sure, I never saw before.
As I went home on Tuesday night,
As drunk as drunk could be.
I saw a coat behind the door,
Where my old coat should be.
I called my wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
Who owns that coat behind the door,
Where my old coat should be?
Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk
You silly old fool,
Still you cannot see.
That's a woolen blanket that my mother sent to me.
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,
But buttons on a blanket, sure, I never saw before.
As I went home on Wednesday night,
As drunk as drunk could be.
I saw a pipe upon the chair,
Where my old pipe should be.
I called my wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
Who owns that pipe upon the chair
Where my old pipe should be.
Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk
You silly old fool,
still you cannot see.
That's a lovely tin-whistle, that my mother sent to me.
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,
But tobacco in a tin-whistle, sure, I never saw before.
As I came home on Thursday nigh,
As drunk as drunk could be.
I saw two boots beside the bed,
Where my old boots should be.
I called my wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
Who owns them boots beside the bed
Where my old boots should be.
Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk
You silly old fool,
Still you cannot see.
They're two lovely flower pots my mother sent to me.
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,
But laces in flower pots I never saw before.
As I came home on Friday night,
As drunk as drunk could be.
I saw a head upon the bed,
Where my old head should be.
I called my wife and I said to her:
Will you kindly tell to me,
Who owns that head upon the bed,
Where my old head should be.
Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk
You silly old fool,
Still you cannot see.
That's a baby boy, that my mother sent to me.
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,
But a baby boy with his whiskers on, sure, I never saw before.

As I was a'walking one evening of late
Where fragrant fine flowers the fields decorate
I carelessly rambled where I did not know
By the fair crystal fountain that falls in Glencoe
And on her who the prize on Mount Ider was won
Then approached me a lassy as bright as the sun
And the ribbon and the tartan around her did flow
That welcomed young Donald the pride of Glencoe
Said I, my fine creature, your charming sweet smile
And your comely fine features my heart has beguiled
And with your kind affection on me you'll bestow
I'll bless the happy hour we met in Glencoe
Kind Sir, she made answer, your love I'll disdain
For I have a young sweetheart and Donald by name
And he went to the wars about ten years ago
And a maid I remain 'till he returns to Glencoe
Ah, perhaps your young Donald regards not your name
And has placed his affection on some foreign dame
He may have forgotten for all that you know
That bonny young creature he left in Glencoe
From his promise my Donald he'd never depart
For love, truth and honour stand firm in his heart
And if I never see him, then single I'll go
And mourn for my Donald the pride of Glencoe
Then seeing her constance he drew out a glove
Which in parting she gave him in token of love
She clung to his arms and tears down did flow
Ah, you're welcome my Donald the pride of Glencoe
Come cheer up my Flora your sorrows are o'er
And since we have met love we'll never part more
And the loud blast of battle, far distant may blow
Whilst in peace and contentment we'll live in Glencoe

Take the wave now and know that you're free
Turn you back on the land face the sea
Face the wind now so wild and so strong
When you think of me, wave to me, and send me a song
Don't look back when you reach the new shore
Don't forget what you're leaving me for
Don't forget when your missing these souls
Love must never hold never hold tight but let go
O the nights will be long
When I'm not in your arms
But I'll be in the song
That you sing to me across the sea
Somehow someday
You'll be faraway so far from me
And maybe one day I will follow you
In all you do
'Till then send me a song
When the sun sets the water will fire
When the winds swells the sails ever higher
Let the call of the bird on the wind
Calm your sadness and lonleness
And then start to sing to me
I will sing to you if you promise
To send me a song
I'll walk by the shore and I hear
Hear your song come so faint and so clear
And I catch it a breath on the wind
And I smile and I sing you song
I will send you a song
I will sing you a song
I will sing to you if you promise to send me a song

When you feel so tired trying
When you ask and no-one knows
When your heart is tired fighting
When you feel like letting go
Take this love I've freely given
Take this dream I'm wishing for
[Chorus]
How long is forever
If I can't see you anymore
I'll miss you most whenever October winds begin to blow
Well these days have lost their meaning
And these nights can feel so cold
Endless days not ever knowing
What is all this suffering for
Take these words "so sad to leaveing"
Take this breath I breathe that's warm
Take these tears so softly falling
Take these love forever more
[Chorus]

Baby I want you, baby I want you
Baby I do
Darling I love you, darling I love you
Know that it's true
Don't leave me here out on my own
Don't you know how I hate to be alone
I just want to be a part of your home
Baby I want you, baby I want you
Baby I do
Darling I love you, darling I love you
Know that it's true
Don't leave me here out in the cold
Don't you know that it's your hand
I wanna hold
As these days fly past and unfold, hey

In the middle of everything I started to see
You said you were a beekeeper, but I heard no bees
I asked you where do you get your honey
You said darling I'm a beekeeper, I'm up to my knees.
Oh I'm a lonely sailor on a sinking boat
Sometimes I think I'm a mermaid but I never float
You asked me why I didn't send you a note
I threw my pen in the gutter with what I wrote.
Oh, oh, just like a dove on a bay riverside with a little black crow.
Wanna know all of the ribs on your cage.
Tell you that a part of me lives in you, and I'm a goddamn fool
Make your move or get out of the game.
At the end of the tunnel I can see the light
I promised you I wouldn't go down without a fight
I know it won't always be black and white
'Cause there are demons and things that go bump in the night.
So swallow your bitter pill
You said you were a thrill seeker but what's your thrill?
It's the way you walk, it's the way you stand still
And the way that you look at me and always will.
Hey, today's the day, are you ready to fall, are you ready to jump
From a plane with a stranger on your back
High in the sky, you look back and where am I at - I'm a man in disguise
Tongue-tied you started to crack
Started to crack and the sky's turning black
And I'm stuck in you like a thumbtack
Between my legs and my arms you're alarmed
And I won't hurt you just want to charm you.
Wanna be there, and I wanna be there
I won't let you go
A beekeeper a thrill seeker
Hit the ground running,"Told you so"

In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the herring, the king of the sea
He sang out old skipper, now you can catch me
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the mackrel with his stripped back
He sang out old skipper, hum haul your main tag
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the sprat, the smallest of all
He sang out old skipper, hum haul your trawl haul
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the crab with his great long claw
He sang out old skipper, you'll run us ashore
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the herring, all broken and spent
He sang rifting's finished now who'll pay the rent
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the herring, right under the lay
He sang rifting's finished, who's bother with me
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together
And up jumped the herring, the king of a shore
He sang rifting's finished, gotta stay on the door
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Whilst when the wind blows we'll all go together

In case of loving unreturned
Unrequited fingers burn
Don't you blame yourself at all
There is no blame, there is no crime
This madness happens all the time
Nothing there to break your fall
I understand how hard it's been
I've been there too and I have seen
What running after love can do
That feeling deep down in your soul
That searing, empty, gaping hole
Has dug a hole in my life too
My darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
But I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
And whisper a prayer to the moon
In case you've lost your faith in life
In case you cannot sleep at night
Be certain this will take its toll
I recognize those waves of pain
I've known them time and time again
And would not wish them on a soul
My darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
Whisper a prayer to the moon
In cases lying by your door
A life is packed to go once more
There was no intent to deceive
Please bear no grudge, just bear your soul
It's hardly bearable to go
And barely possible to leave
Oh, my sweet tempered angel
I wish I were able
To heal all that hurt with a tune
And if I had the powers
I would give you the stars
The sun and the light of the moon
Oh, my darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
But I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
And whisper a prayer to the moon
Oh, my darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
Whisper a prayer to the moon
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer to the moon
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer to the moon

Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes
Calling us, calling on, Christmas night
Call us from far, call us from near
Oh, play me your Christmas pipes
Christmas bells, Christmas bells
Over the hills and over the dells
Ringing out bright, ringing out clear
Oh, ring me your Christmas bells
Christmas strings, Christmas strings
Playing the peace that Christmas brings
Fiddle and bow, gentle and low
Oh, play me your Christmas strings
Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes
Calling us, calling on, Christmas night
Call us from far, call us from near
Oh, play me your Christmas pipes
(O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining)
(It is the night of our dear Savior's birth)
Christmas choir, Christmas choir
Christmas carols 'round Christmas fire
Holy night, angels on high
Round up your Christmas choir
Christmas band, Christmas band
You're waiting for me with your Christmas band
Cymbal and drum, rattle and hum
March out your Christmas band
Good to be home to your Christmas pipe
Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes
Calling us, calling on Christmas night
Call us from far, call us from near
Play me your Christmas pipes
Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes
Calling us, calling on Christmas night
Call us from far, call us from near
Oh, play me your Christmas pipes
Play me your Christmas pipes
Good to be home, good to be home
Good to be home to your Christmas pipe

Hey, Baby I just got back from town
Where the bribes are paid
Honey, they turned my offer down
They say the deal's already made
So now I gotta stand and watch
While it all comes down
And the buzzards and the hawks
And the judges and the mob
Circle round
Now if I were the queen of all the world
I would go in chains just to see you free
Of the ropes that bind you
And the role you play
And the pride that hooks you
While the big ones get away
Love junkies wanna change the world:
It quickly stays the same
Money junkies hire all the smart ones
Power junkies run the game
One step at a time
Polarity Hill
If the bad guys don't get you, baby
Then the good guys will
With angels on the take
And the gangsters in the yard
Hey don't the wars come easy
Hey don't the peace come hard

I've been talking to myself lately
I'm asking for advice, oh
I've been slowly loosening my grip on this reality
Tongue-tied, the dominoes break
So won't you lend me your faith?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been talking to myself, ooh
Earthbound, and scatter-brained
Can I thrive on pocket change?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been whispering to ghosts lately
I'm begging for more time, oh
Before I'm buried deeper in the trenches of insanity
Oh, feed me a piece of my mind
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been talking to myself, ooh
Earthbound and scatter-brained
Can I thrive on pocket change?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
Oh, how'd my own molecules forsake me?
Atoms chained behind my back
I should be bold, I should be bold in my logic and reasoning
But I just calculate my intentions
I hope that won't follow me to my old age
I'm a moss-covered stone on a foothill
And I'm tumbling, tumbling
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh
I've been talking to myself, ooh
Earthbound and scatter-brained
Can I thrive on pocket change?
I've been talking to myself lately, ooh

I want to go where the blind can see
I want to go where the lame will walk
I wanna see the sick ones clean
Where the deaf can hear and the silent talk
[Chorus]
Where are you going, to a ghostdance in the snow?
Are your all, maybe warriors, that are finally coming home
I wanna go where the dead are raised
Where the mountain lion lays down with the lamb
I wanna stand where God is praised
I wanna ride across the plains to the promised land
[Chorus]
Where I'm going don't need to raise your voice
No starvation, have plenty to eat
No guns, no wars, no hateful noise
Just a victory dance, we'll never taste defeat
Where there's nothin' done or said that can't be forgiven
Where every step you take is on sacred ground
Walk away from death into the land of the living
Where all the lost tribes are finally found
[Chorus: x2]
As they're finally coming home

He got a new mercy, a new grace
Street corner preacher with the angry face
He got 2 years off for good behavior
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior
That's two old ladies and a junkie now, now
He can see for sure that his work is cut out
Though he walks through the shadows he won't fear his neighbor
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior
Bau bau, put it on back
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau, put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau, put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah, bau bau, ya ya
Well, he understands the need for living it large
But it's hard to get a job with a felony charge
Now he's working in a hospital washing dishes
Walking through the fields of the lost inhibitions
There is death everywhere, the new benediction
To save the liver from awaking death is his conviction
The eyes of man, well he seeks no favor
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior
But there's a whole lotta trouble all around
Every night the same old siren sound
There's a whole lotta trouble all around
Children, soldiers in this battle ground
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau, put 'em bop
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau, put 'em bop
Ah put it in
A bau bau, ya ya
Well, a new sun and a second chance
He unbolts the door and hops over the fence
Young woman with a baby that her daddy gave her
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior
But all around the war rages on
Burnt out houses with the front door gone
Well, his faith is his fountain, his love is his labor
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior
Whoa, yeah, ahh
Bau, bau, put it on back
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau, put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah bau bau, put it ooh bop
Ah put it in
Ah, bau bau, ya ya
He got a new mercy, a new grace
Street corner preacher with the angry face
He got 2 years off for good behavior
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior

I caught a string full of fish down by the damn
I'll drag them back to the field they should be dead by then
Wipe the sweat off my neck and tally ho the plow
I'm gonna grow a woman from the ground
The night was a chalkboard with a fingernail moon
If the fish ain't dead yet they will be pretty soon
Kinda like the feeling at an old folks home
Even though you love them you can't wait for them to go
I'll call her Angelina she's a teacher I once had
A halo of honey wrapped around her head
And she always used to give me some when I was a kid
I told her that I loved her and then I went and hid
I'll take you into town and I'll show you off
And there's room on your dress for a corsage
And I'll open up every door for you
I opened up my almanac and in my head I read
Cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can
So I rolled up my sleeves and then began to draw lines just as deep as the days are long
I sewed up my wrist and sewed the ground with my blood
Staind up my clothes pretty good and I turned that dirt to mud
I couldn't help but close my eyes and lay my body down
'Cause I heard it takes forever to grow a woman from the ground
I bleed for you now and I'm skinny as a rail
And I'll be so obliged to keep you nice and warm and safe
And won't you be so proud of me

A little bitty tear let me down,
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown,
But a little bitty tear let me down.
You said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow,
That I'd laugh when you walked away.
A little bitty tear let me down,
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown,
But a little bitty tear let me down.
I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go.
A little bitty tear let me down,
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown,
But a little bitty tear let me down.
Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your grip through the door.
A little bitty tear let me down,
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown,
But a little bitty tear let me down.
A little bitty tear let me down.

'Twas down by the Glenside I met an old woman
A plucking young nettles she ne'er saw me coming
I listened a while to the song she was humming
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men
It`s fifty long years since I saw the moon beamin'
On strong manly force, their eyes with hope gleamin'
I see them again through all my sad dreamin'
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men
Some died by the hillside, some died with the stranger
And wise men have told us their cause was a failure
But they loved their old Ireland and they never feared danger
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men
I passed on my way, God be praised that I met her
Be life long or short, I will never forget her
We may have brave men but we'll never have better
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men

Walk down the road eyes on my feet
Out of the window came an easy beat
A love song hit me like a bolt out of the blue
Made me realise for the first time ever
We've never been apart, every second we're together
It dawned on me, hey babe, has it dawned on you?
Like Bogey and Bacall
Scarlett and Rhett
A little like Romeo and Juliet
And some other couple we ain't heard of yet
We're crazy and madly and deeply and truly and wildly and easy in love
Like me and you
Me and you
Ordering in, tuning out
Always having so much we can talk about
Lying 'round in pajamas in the middle of the afternoon
Knowing what you're thinking just before you think
Saying it all with a nod and a wink
Turning out the light and switching off the evening news
Like Bogey and Bacall
Scarlett and Rhett
A little like Romeo and Juliet
And some other couple we ain't heard of yet
We're crazy and madly and deeply and truly and wildly and easy in love
Like me and you
Me and you
Hold my hand and look into my eyes
Babe you're all I've needed
Now I got you by my side
Like Bogey and Bacall
Scarlett and Rhett
A little like Romeo and Juliet
And some other couple we ain't heard of yet
We're crazy and madly and deeply and truly and wildly and easy in love
Like Bogey and Bacall
Scarlett and Rhett
A little like Romeo and Juliet
And some other couple we ain't heard of yet
We're crazy and madly and deeply and truly and wildly and easy in love
Crazy and madly and deeply and truly and wildly and easy in love
Like me and you
Like me and you
Like me and you
Like me and you

My home towns dear to me, its always in my sight
My citys shadows walk around in broad daylight
Theyll even shoot a woman down for what she writes
So now you pay for civil liberty with life
So hard, its easy to lose hope for everyone
So bad, its easier to never take it on
But we cant give up
And we cant lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be afraid
You must not ever stop the search for peace within
'Cause if you find it, theres no better prize to win
In losing peace of mind youre losing everything
Dont draw away from it, whatever shape youre in
So hard, its easy to lose hope for everyone
So bad, its easier to never take it on
But we cant give up
And we cant lose hope
And we cannot hide away
'Cause we can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be afraid
With all our songs and stories we have brushed aside
The very nature of a beast we tried to hide
With all the ugliness this city has to fight
How could we leave it to a mother and a wife?
So hard, its easy to lose hope for everyone
So bad, its easier to never take it on
But we cant give up
And we cant lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be
We must not be afraid
We must not be afraid
We must not be afraid
We cant give up
And we cant lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be
We must not be afraid
We must not be afraid
We must not be afraid

Last Sunday Mornin', Lord, Lord Lord (my recollection is that every line repeats)
Yeaah, Last Sunday Mornin' Lord Lord
I went huntin for the grey goose, Lord, Lord Lord
I went huntin for the grey goose, Lord, Lord Lord
missing bits ?
Well I took along my shotgun, Lord, Lord, Lord
repeat
And along come the grey goose Lord, Lord, Lord
repeat
So i raised up my shotgun (sic.)
and the gun went cabooloo, Lord, Lord, Lord
repeat
missing bits
He was six weeks afallin'
repeat
He was nine months a cookin'
repeat
and the knife wouldn't cut him
and the fork wouldn't stick him
and the last time I seen him
He was flyin' o'er the ocean
with a long string of goslin's,
Lord, Looord, Loooorrrrrd.

In a neat little town they called Belfast
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town
As sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
betrayed by the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
I took a stroll down broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
come a-traipsing along the highway
She was both fair and handsome
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said, was
Bad 'cess to the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Before the judge and the jury
Next morning, I had to appear
The judge, he says to me:
"Young man, you're case it is proven clear
We'll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band"
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
They'll feed you with strong drink, me lads
'Til you are unable to stand
And the very first thing that you'll know is
You've landed in Van Diemens Land
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

These apathetic eyes
Dark just like the sky
the raindrops hit the window sill
so leave me here tonight
Leave me by myself
with all my imperfections
Running through my head
everything I wished I was
Running through my head
Forget about the sun
tonight the world revolves around you
I could swear your frown
Pulled the clouds down from the sky
Created this fog tonight
And on the car ride home
You retreated to your head
A thousand words I should have said
Running through my head
But we just stared at the road
Running through my head
And you just cried
Forget about the sun
tonight the world revolves around you

We are drifting and rolling along the road
Tryin' to bear my heavy load
Like a log that's been passed on the side
I'm so heavy and so tired
And I know me a few men in my time
None of them worth a lousy dime
And they make me work like a doggone slave
Won't be happy 'till I'm in my grave
And I've been drifting and rolling along the road
Tryin' to bear my heavy load
And like a log that's been passed on the side
I'm so heavy and so tired
My world you don't took it and torn it in two
Who'd ever thought it of a boy like you
It looked hot, I thought it was a sugar and spice
Salty water turned to ice

I grew up in a little town
A southern mix of lost and found
Where most folks seem to stick around
But I could hear the highway song
I'd sit out on the dock till dawn
And dream about the great beyond
(I dreamed that I was)
A world traveler
Set me loose to find my way
Just get me out on the road someday
With my sails unfurled
So many mysteries
I wanted to unravel
If I could travel the world
Soon enough I had my way
I saw the world the Lord has made
Mostly from the interstate
But I had hardly seen a thing
Until I gave a golden ring
To the one who gave her heart to me
(And I became)
A world traveler
That's the day I hit the road
'Cause I walked the hills of the human soul
Of a tender girl
I'm a world traveler
She opened the gate and took my hand
And led me into the mystic land
Where her galaxies swirl
So many mysteries
I never will unravel
I want to travel the world
Take a left at the end of my street
Just a few doors down
Up the hill and into the trees
There's a hole in the ground
Where we traveled the caverns so deep
We wandered the wonders so wide
It was right beneath our feet
All this time, all this time
Tonight I saw the children in their rooms
Little flowers all in bloom
Burning suns and silver moon
And somehow in that starry sky
The image of the Maker lies
Right here beneath my roof tonight
(So hold on tight, I'm a)
World traveler
Pack yours bags and dig down deep
Let's ride the storms and sail the seas
To the distant pole
I'm a world traveler
Into these uncharted lands
To blaze a trail in the vast expanse
Of the heart and soul
In the grace of the God of peace
Let's wade into the battle
Come on, come on with me
And get up in that saddle
There's a million mysteries
I never will unravel
Come on, let's travel the world

Board a train, take it east
Find myself again
Western winds drove me there
Lonely stars, take me back home
I chased a dream, I read about
In a magazine
And lost myself, in the dark
Lonely stars, Take me back home
Someday I'll find
A truth in this life
Till then
When I go, leave me be
Let me find my peace
Coastal town, summer skin
Lonely stars, Take me back home

Knew a man, a captain of industry
Who built his house on pain and human misery
Had a wife who ran in High Society
Had several kids living lives oh so thoughtlessly
And you will never see a house so bloody pretty
Decked with tapestries in every single hall
And you will never see a house so bloody stunning
Made for the man who surely has it all
But take a closer look and you will find
His massive gold gates are made from tears
His investors lost their homes and everything
Poor investors left with nothing but their fears
Knew a man, a captain of industry
Who built his house on pain and human misery
Elected to the Board of every single civic Symphony
Attended dinners thrown by every rubber chicken charity
And you will never see a house so bloody pretty
Decked with tapestries in every single hall
And you will never see a house so bloody stunning
Made for the man who surely has it all
But take a closer look and you will find
His driveways paved with bricks of mad despair
His investors lost their homes and everything
Poor investors left with nothing but a prayer
Knew a man, a captain of industry
Who built his house on pain and human misery
Died so rich, far beyond his wildest dream
Alone in his bed, nobody cared to grieve
Nobody gives a damn about the captain of industry
Nobdy gives a hoot about the captain of industry
Nobody gives a piss about the captain of industry
Nobody gives a fart about the captain of industry
Living on misery

Missed the morning too, didn't rise before noon.
She's a lazy lady today.
Always yawning, you with your eyes on the moon.
You're a crazy lady I'd say, da da da.
Now should I say more, for I know so well
And you're no hazy maiden in grey.
How can I be sure, it's not easy to tell.
But you're a crazy lady, I'd say.
Crazy lady.

Walking past my lover's house
Bitter taste still in my mouth
Too much whiskey, too much smoke
Last night's tears hang on my coat
But now the rain has stopped its fall
Streets shine like a mirror ball
Sun comes on, it's just enough
Watch the flower's waking up
It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
Big machines all in a row
Mother with her child in tow
Change old paper for silver coins
Lose myself in all this noise
Wake up from a peaceful rest
Counting down, one minute left
Cotton stops its jog in place
I hold it warm against my face
It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
What's this in my dungarees
In my back pocket, curled and creased
My old notebook, filled with you
Our secrets now just streaks of blue
It's all a mess but beautiful
This emptiness, a gift I hold
I write a poem with you in mind
And leave the memories behind
I leave the memories behind
It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
Feel the threads like new again
Feel the threads like new again

I am a wand'ring minstrel man,
And Love my only theme,
I've stray'd beside the pleasant Bann,
And eke the Shannon's stream;
I've pip'd and play'd to wife and maid
By Barrow, Suir, and Nore,
But never met a maiden yet
Like Brighidin Ban Mo Store.
My girl hath ringlets rich and rare,
By Nature's fingers wove -
Loch-Carra's swan is not so fair
As her breast of love;
And when she moves, in Sunday sheen,
Beyond our cottage door,
I'd scorn the high-born Saxon queen
For Brighidin Ban Mo Store.
It is not that thy smile is sweet,
And soft thy voice of song -
It is not that thou fleest to meet
My comings lone and long;
But that doth rest beneath thy breast,
A heart of purest core,
Whose pulse is known to me alone,
My Brighidin Ban Mo Store!

It's a strange day
The roses are in bloom
But in a strange way
I know somehow we're doomed
Look around through the town
Not a soul to be found
In silence, not a sound
There's no one around but you
In the back of the car
On our way from the bar
In silence, here we are
Reminding us we're doomed
We'll get sad it's time we've come to the end
We've circled around our doom
And I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you
In a strange place
When the sun goes down, we move
Into a strange phase
Like we've got nothing left to lose
So we slip through the town
With our heads in the clouds
In silence, not a sound
For miles and miles around
Fall asleep in the park
Underneath all the stars
In silence, here we are
Reminded of how we're doomed
Get sad it's time we've come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you
It's you
All that I want is you
Yeah, you
All that I want is you
So get sad it's we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you
Now get sad it's time we've come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
'Cause all that I want is you

All my best days are behind me now
Photographs tell of my wedding vows.
And if you want heroes then I'd sail up to the stars
For all I got beneath my skin are tears and scars.
I walked in these shoes ten thousand miles,
Been through all sorts of bleating trials,
So if you want heroes then I'll tell you where to go
I'll sell you a map to thank the faces that you know
Oh but for now I'll just be at this all night show
Oh yes tonight I'll spend my lonely dollar slow.
Yes I've loved and lost and loved again
Happy ever afters never been
And if you want love than I suggest that you not wait
Cause I will know not what I've waited at heaven's gate
All my best days are behind me now
Still I find a way to live somehow.

When I was a kid I wanted to grow up and be a cop in a
province town or county
I thought it would be great if somedy i could be a
Mountie
I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because taht's
part of the profession
But now I just sit on my horse and tell American tourists the
parliament's in session
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my
head in every parade
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending
my career in Motorcades
CHORUS
I wanna enforce the law, I wanna wear normal clothes
I don't wanna have to smile for diplomat's home videos
I'm good at workin' real hard, I should have joined the Coast
Gaurd
Oh no the RCMP, is not the life for me
I used to think that a Mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble
strong and thrifty
But even though we don't break ranks we get no thanks, they
took us off the fifty (dollar bill)
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like gaurds in
shopping malls, it's such a pain
Like someone's plotting to kill the minister of
Sports and Recreation now that's insane
Sometimes I just wanna puke Sgt. Preston of the Yukon
Dudley Dooright's such a jerk
And though he tries with all his heart, my horse couldn't catch a
shopping cart
Somedays I hate to go to work
CHORUS
Hilarious Banter
CHORUS

My own love said to me
"My mother won't mind.
And my daughters won't slight you
For your lack of kind".
He went away from me
And this he did say
"It will not be long, Love,
Till our wedding day"
He went away from me
And he moved through the fair
And slowly I watched him
Move here and move there
He went his way homeward
With one star awake
As this swan in the evening
Moves over the lake
I dreamed last night
That my own love came in
He came in so sweetly
His feet made no din
He came close beside me
And this he did say
"It will not be long Love
Till our wedding day"
It will not be long love
Long love
Long love
Love

MY JOHNNY LAD
I bought a wife in Edinburgh
For a bawbie;
And then I got a farthing back
To buy terbaccer wi'
cho: And wi' you, and wi' you, and wi' you, my Johnny lad,
I'll dance the buckles off my shoes wi' you my Johnny lad.
As I was walkin' Sunday, 'twas there I saw the Queen,
A-playln' at the football wi' the lads on Glasgow green,
The captain 'o the other slde was scorin' wi' great style,
The queen, she called a policeman, and had him thrown in jail.
Samson was a mlghty man, and he fought wi' the cuddy's jaw,
He fought a thousand battles wearlng crlmson flannel drawers.
Napoleon was an emperor, and he ruled on land and sea,
He ruled all France and Germany, but he didn't rule Jock McGhee.
Now Johnny Is a bonny lad, he is a lad of mine,
I've never had a better lad and I've had twenty-nine.

Somewhere along the Scottish coast
And emerald island lies
And I will steer my sailing boat
Unto the Isle of Skye
The weather's always changing
From heavy cloud to fair
And even when it's raining
It's always lovely there

Captain, Captain, tell me true does my sweet Willie sail with you?
No my dear, he isn't here for he is drowned in this ocean, dear
Answer me, oh give me joy for I love my soldier boy
Oh no, lady, he's not here. Dropped down dead in the gulf, my dear
Get me a chair to sit upon, and pen and ink, come write it down
On every line I will shed a tear: on every verse cry oh, my dear.
Captain, Captain, build me a boat, out on these waters I must float
Searching for my Willy dear, for he has drowned in this ocean dear

Fire's burn, turning into dust
What was precious, what was pretty paradise
Fire's turn, burning to the ground.
What was healthy what was holy, what was life.
If you think it's hot now,
If you hate that heat
You think it's bad now, wait and see,
You think it's close now as you sleep within your bed.
Check out the fire
Check out the fire
Check out the fire overhead.
Children grow, playing with their toys
Acting out their fairytales in play
Children play, growing with the noise
Of television teaching them the way,
And while you're sometimes scared now
If you see the flames
You think the smoke's from far away,
You read the papers, saying the fire will not spread
Repeat CHORUS
Sweet the light, glowing neon blue
Of havens offering shelter from the storm
Sweet the sound, crackling in the grate
Of firelight, welcoming and warm
But if you think it's safe now,
If you feel at ease
Your safety's hanging from a thread
Before you're happy, having locked your doors at night
Repeat CHORUS

All you need is time
All you need is time, time,
Time to make me bend
Give it a try, don't be rude
Put it to the test and
I'll give it right back to you
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
Kick it around, take it to town
Try to defy what you feel inside
You better be strong
Your love belongs to us
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
All I need is trust
All I need is trust, trust,
Trust to make it show
I don't want to know everything you done
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
All we need is faith
All we need is faith, faith,
Faith to make it nice
Kick it around, don't be rude
If you're gonna make a mistake
Don't you make it twice
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day

'Tis the last rose of summer,
Left blooming alone.
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flow'r of her kindred,
No rosebud is nigh,
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.
I'll not leave thee thou lone one
To pine on the stem,
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed,
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
So soon may I follow
When friendships decay,
And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown
Oh! Who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?

A troubled wind has chilled my heart
Killed our love right from the start
And visions of your face
Twist in my mind into knots of silken lace
A chance to win a hand so fair
Fades with night and a single prayer
Then a straw hat on her head
Brings morning dreams to alight upon my bed
If dead men swam the waters deep
Then fish would cry all in their sleep
My love, I can only try
To lift my hat from the depths as you walk by
Now banjos ring and fiddles play
A candle burns to light my way
And turning in my sleep
I dream again of your love, your love to keep

I remember the day of the Tennessee flood
The sound of the scream and the sight of the blood
My son he saw as the animal died
In the jaws of the dog as the river ran by
I said, "Come back soon."
It's there on the page of the book that I read
The boy grew up and the yearling was dead
He stood at the gate with the angel on guard
And wept for the death of his little boy heart
I say, "Come back soon."
We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
For deliverance
Deliverance, O Lord
I sit on the bench at the bend in the trail
And I can feel in the fall the final exhale
The trees of the field all wring their hands
And the leaves go by like a funeral band
I say, "Come back soon."
We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
Are we alone in this great darkness?
If nature's red in tooth and in claw
Then it seems to me that she's an outlaw
'Cause every death is a question mark
At the end of the book of a beating heart
And the answer is scrawled in the silent dark
On the dome of the sky in a billion stars
But we cannot read these angel tongues
And we cannot stare at the burning sun
And we cannot sing with these broken lungs
So we kick in the womb and we beg to be born
Deliverance!
Deliverance, O Lord!

AUNT RHODY
Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody,
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old gray goose is dead.
The one she's been saving to make a feather bed.
The old gander's weeping, because his wife is dead.
The goslings are mourning, because their mother's dead.
She died in the mill pond from standing on her head.
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old gray goose is dead.

I've reached the land of corn and wine,
And all it riches freely mine,
Now shines undimmed the blistful day,
But all my sins are cast away
Oh, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore,
My Heav?n, my home forever more!
The Savior comes and walks with me
And sweet communion here have we,
He gently leads me with His hand,
For this is Heaven?s table land.
Oh, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore,
My Heav?n, my home forever more!
The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of Heaven?s melody,
And angels with the white robed throng
Join in the sweet redemption song.
Oh, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore,

Shake your beads out,
One by one
And call me Magdalene
It won't grieve me
I understand
Where it is you're coming from
Draw a curtain
Close your eyes
When history's pages fail you.
I will not open up those history books
That's not for me to do.
Precious little in your life
Is yours by right
And won without a fight
Precious little in your life
Is yours by right
And won without a fight.
Shadows call me,
In the wind
Some don't go away
Angels guide me
From the clouds
In everything I do and say
Shake your beads out
Kneeling down
It will not pass me by
Two people coming from a different place
Maybe neither one is right.

Shake your beads out
Join your hands
That still won't make you right
Those so-called sinners that you're praying for
Are standing by your side

Let me see generation times
Will we hear children singing rhymes
Sweet memories gone by
They're gone by
Let me be wiser with my eyes
Let me see my love by my side
Let me see heaven
Lonely tears of searching the wilderness
How this world can lead us all astray
Don't let me cry over colourless pictures
No more bitter winds
No more troubled seas
Just forgive me
And let me see
Let me see my love
Let me see
Let me see my love
Let me see (Chorus)
Crossing the room
I recognize the child in me
I'll close my eyes to release away all my fears
We silence the rose to see it blossom back again
Step by step we walk on
Word by word we talk on
Just forgive me
And let me see

The Old Orange Flute
In the county Tyrone, in the town of Dungannon
Where many a ruckus meself had a hand in
Bob Williamson lived there, a weaver by trade
And all of us thought him a stout-hearted blade.
On the twelfth of July as it yearly did come
Bob played on the flute to the sound of the drum
You can talk of your fiddles, your harp or your lute
But there's nothing could sound like the Old Orange Flute.
But the treacherous scoundrel, he took us all in
For he married a Papish named Bridget McGinn
Turned Papish himself and forsook the Old Cause
That gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
And the boys in the county made such a stir on it
They forced Bob to flee to the province of Connaught;
Took with him his wife and his fixins, to boot,
And along with the rest went the Old Orange Flute.
Each Sunday at mass, to atone for past deeds,
Bob said Paters and Aves and counted his beads
Till one Sunday morn, at the priest's own require
Bob went for to play with the flutes in the choir.
He went for to play with the flutes in the mass
But the instrument quivered and cried."O Alas!"
And blow as he would, though he made a great noise,
The flute would play only "The Protestant Boys".
Bob jumped up and huffed, and was all in a flutter.
He pitched the old flute in the best holy water;
He thought that this charm would bring some other sound,
When he tried it again, it played "Croppies Lie Down!"
And for all he would finger and twiddle and blow
For to play Papish music, the flute would not go;
"Kick the Pope" to "Boyne Water" was all it would sound
Not one Papish bleat in it could e'er be found.
At a council of priests that was held the next day
They decided to banish the Old Flute away;
They couldn't knock heresy out of its head
So they bought Bob another to play in its stead.
And the Old Flute was doomed, and its fate was pathetic
'Twas fastened and burnt at the stake as heretic.
As the flames rose around it, you could hear a strange noise
'Twas the Old Flute still a-whistlin' "The Protestant Boys".
Note: the tune Protestant Boys is also known as Lilliburlero RG

O the summer time has come
And the trees are sweetly bloomin'
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather
Will ye go

And round it I will pile
All the wild flowers o' the mountain

And the deep glen sae dreamy
And return wi' their spoils
Tae the bower o' my dearie

An' I've licked all the Murphys afloat,

comin from a long line of pain
my family suffered greatly for my gain
and i think a lot about
how my daddy died so i would not live with out
and his heart lives in my song
the melody comes and just as quickly the melody is gone
and I'm back alone far from home
now my mamma's on her own
i try to call and see her when i'm home
after all that she's been through
all the doctors say there ain't nothin we can do
and her heart lives in my song
the melody comes and just as quickly the melody is gone
and I'm back alone far from home
there's a bird outside my window who takes the song where he goes
and leaves it there
like a dead man's rockin chair
and tonight i'm feelin lost and
headin down the highway out to boston
i get the sense that i might lose it
i thank god tonight for the light i got in music
cause my heart lives in this song
the melody comes and just as quickly the melody is gone
I'm back alone far from home

On the banks of the roses, my love and I sat down
And I took out my violin to play my love a tune
In the middle of the tune, O she sighed and she said
O Johnny, lovely Johnny, Would you leave me
O when I was a young man, I heard my father say
That he'd rather see me dead and buried in the clay
Sooner than be married to any runaway
By the lovely sweet banks of the roses
O then I am no runaway and soon I'll let them know
I can take a good glass or leave it alone
And the man that doesn't like me, he can keep
his daughter home
And young Johnny will go roving with another
And if ever I get married, twill be in the month of May
When the leaves they are green and the meadows
they are gay
And I and my true love can sit and sport and play
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses

There I go saying the same old things
Something to rhyme or to cling to
When times were tough, I didn't say enough
Like some sweet lines to say to you, relate to you
[Chorus]
What will I do without you?
What will I do? Heaven knows
What will I do without you?
What will I do?
We watch the seasons come and go
Leaves are falling as water flows
We took for granted the love that's wanted
A leaning shoulder to cry on
[Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know
Every day my heart will stray
And dream of the memories we left behind
Love is a reason, a reason to live
So don't let it slip away
[Chorus]
What will I do without you?
What will I do?
I don't know, I don't know

Alone upon the sidewalks of despair, 'twas there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was grooving
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care, a go-go girl in love

Covered in darkness a time that is past
Waiting adrift they cannot hold back
Cannot hold back
Tear misted eyes standing alone
A broken will over all that they?ve known
[Chorus:]
Out in the distance far is the calling
Shadows still steal
Through the place that they knew
A vision that?s empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams
Sorrow deepens only to tell
That silence speaks where words cannot mend
Words cannot mend
A vision that?s empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams
[Chorus]
Covered in darkness a time that is past
Waiting adrift they cannot hold back
Cannot hold back
Tear misted eyes standing alone
A broken will over all that they?ve known
[Chorus]

Runnin', runnin' from home
Breakin' ties that you'd grown
Catchin' dreams from the clouds
The city sounds burn your soul
Turn your head to the cries
Of loneliness in the night
Just like a fly when it's caught
The spider soon takes it's prey
Spins a dance round your heart
Give me your beauty and age
A pleasure pleasing my mind
Your heart will shatter and fall
Step on pavements so old
Cast a glance at the young
Girls a making their way
The passing image of you
Reflects a pain to my heart
And disappears in a crowd
Runnin', runnin' from home
Breakin' ties that you'd grown
Catchin' dreams from the clouds

Dying is an art like everything else
I do it exceptionally well
I do it that it feels like hell
I do it that it seems real
I guess you could say I've a call
It's easy enough to do it in a cell
It's easy enough to do it and stay put
It's theatrical, beware !
Herr God, Herr Lucifer beware !
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair
and I'll eat men like air
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair
Herr God, Herr Lucifer beware!
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair
and I'll eat men like air
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair
Herr God, Herr Lucifer beware !

It's a way of recovering what I lost...(in the Vicodin)
When I began, I tried to make it right, but it went wrong.
And then it's hard to unravel the knots in your heart.
It's an escape, a secret love when God won't listen anymore, all i think:
GOD, I've done too much damage to my body.
It's HARD, when you feel like your world was made to cave.
(For way too long, I kept holding on)
but now I'm tired of everything....
I try to ignore the fact that I can't breathe anymore.
Back then, we had a good run when I was sober, but it's all gone.
(and if you can't understand)
I was good at everything....
Dear love, they took the best part of me.
In my life...I've felt so distracted.
Afraid to start again.
Alcohol burns like a bombshell.
I Died, put the morphine on the medicine spinner...
Oh MY GOD, I've done too much damage to my body.
It's HARD, when you feel like your world was made to cave.
(For way too long, I kept holding on)
but now I'm tired of everything....
(When the finger slip, you can forget me holding on)
Now I'm tired of everything....
I try to ignore the fact that I can't breathe anymore.
Back then, we had a good run when I was sober, but it's all gone.
(and if you can't understand)
I was good at everything....
Dear love, they took the best part of me.
(I Kept trying but I'm tired of everything)

She went into the graveyard with trouble on her mind.
She was lookin' for the man who make her crazy.
From her big brown coat she puller a silver knife.
As she held it in her hand, her heart was racing.
You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do.
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.
Its been nine long years since you took my hand.
I'll never understand what made you do it,
And how you twisted up my soul, through me in a hole.
I didn't come this far to see you through it
You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do.
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.
Babe, I'm sorry for you, but it's what I have to do.
You died that night beneath the leaves have fallen,
And the devil will stand by; smilin' bright, his pitchfork high.
A ghost from all these graves will come a callin'.
You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do.
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.
So she stabbed him in the heart.
Her shinning blade it ripped apart
His skin and pierced thought the center,
And I lay my body down, through me on the ground,
And cover me so I can hide from my dominator.
You're low down and dirty,
So low down.
You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. (x3)
If I stay I'll never find my way back home,

Good evening, all my jolly lads, I'm glad to find you well
If you'll gather all around me, now, the story I will tell
For I've got a situation and begorrah and begob
I can whisper all the weekly wage of nineteen bob
'Tis twelve months come October since I left me native home
After helping them Killarney boys to bring the harvest down
But now I wear the gansey and around me waist a belt
I'm the gaffer of the squad that makes the hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
The other night a copper comes and he says to me, McGuire
Would you kindly let me light me pipe down at your boiler fire?
And he planks himself right down in front, with hobnails up, till late
And says I, me decent man, you'd better go and find your bait
He ups and yells, I'm down on you, I'm up to all yer pranks
Don't I know you for a traitor from the Tipperary ranks?
Boys, I hit straight from the shoulder and I gave him such a belt
That I knocked him into the boiler full of hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
We quickly dragged him out again and we threw him in the tub
And with soap and warm water we began to rub and scrub
But devil the thing, it hardened and it turned him hard as stone
And with every other rub, sure you could hear the copper groan
I'm thinking, says O'Reilly, that he's lookin' like old Nick
And burn me if I am not inclined to claim him with me pick
Now, says I, it would be easier to boil him till he melts
And to stir him nice and easy in the hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
You may talk about yer sailor lads, ballad singers and the rest
Your shoemakers and your tailors but we please the ladies best
The only ones who know the way their flinty hearts to melt
Are the lads around the boiler making hot asphalt
With rubbing and with scrubbing, sure I caught me death of cold
For scientific purposes, me body it was sold
In the Kelvin grove museum, me boys, I'm hangin' in me pelt
As a monument to the Irish, making hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt

Often on the weekend I'll jump in my car
I'll not fill up the tank although I'm going far
And if somebody asks me if I'm going to a bar
I'll say I'm shopping 'cross the border in the USA
I do not go down there to buy my groceries
I respect our farmers and our factories
I don't believe that local means it's poor in quality
It's just our goddamned prices are too high
(If he stays away for just two days)
I get one hundred dollars duty-free
(Though it adds two more, will I claim it or)
I don't declare the products if they're in my trunk
(He won't declare the products if they're in his trunk)
Although it is Canada that I call home
I don't cheer for the Yankees when I'm in the dome
I didn't swell with pride during the desert storm
It's just that I don't want to pay the tax
(It's just that he's too cheap to pay the tax)
(Yes it's just like this, he's a loyalist)
I'll only shop at malls that fly our flag
(And he'll tell Bob Ray that he just won't pay)
Unless I need my unemployment benefits
(Get a job! Get a job! Get a job!)
Now everybody's doing the same thing as me
They're doing what they can to beat the GST
They're lining up for miles at the duty-free
So I bought a J.C. Penney store in Buffalo
(So everybody come on down to Buffalo)
('Cause if you stay away for just two days)
You'll get one hundred dollars duty free
(Though it's not at par, it will still go far)
And it ends up in the pockets of our countryman
(It ends up in the pockets of our countryman)

In dreams I appear and take her
Down a path she dares not wander
In a town beset by plunder
I shake her blood and bone
In dreams she asks my guidance
How to live in holy silence
Beyond the anger of her father
Enrich her mind and soul
Hold me inside all the night
Your leaders your baby
Hold me inside all the night
Your teacher loves you crazy
In dreams she feels me beside her
As I stoke her female fire
In a world that feels so lonely
I fill her need and hope
In dreams I appear and take her
On wings of heavens power
Beyond tears that stain her pillow
She takes my love and poem.
Hold me inside all the night
Your leaders your baby
Hold me inside all the night
Your teacher loves you crazy
Hold me

Look up at the sky if you feel lonely
This is the same sky I stare at too
I remember the day your eyes fell on me
So shining eyes now I'm wondering
Why are you sad?
You knew I had to leave
'Cause I live in a different world
Still I'm not so far away from you
I feel so small down in the garden
My mind is restless when I think of you
We're so alike and so different
Not only friends so promise me
Please don't be sad
Although it's time to leave
If this is true love
Please save a place in your heart for me

Child of mine, you are the wildest wind
And the dearest dream I will ever know
Love's lasting light shines out from deep within
This father's heart as I watch you grow
Child of mine, you are the break of dawn
And the brightest star I will ever know
Love's lasting light comes shining on and on
From this mother's heart as I watch you grow
There is a road and that road is all your own
But we are here, you need not walk alone
To face, not fear each coming new unknown
Is the way to lift your wings
Child of mine, you are the sweetest song
And the greatest gift I will ever know
Child of mine, where spirits fly above
There is but one that belongs to you
So let it grow and it will thrive on love
For it is love that sees us through

My "Heart" is a way out from here.
Then she's wondering why I cut away, strip away everything inside.
I cut myself way too deep this time.
I cut myself way too deep inside!
Alleviating all pain and she's asking me why?
Why do I choose to pull away inside?
Everything's already black inside!
I hope you feel this!
From a real wound budding and exposed.
I hope it digs in!
(DIGS IN) Caving in from the weight!
I hope you feel this!
None of that fake heart they gave to you.
I hope it digs in until your heart, it grows!
I hope you feel this!
Out of me and into you!
I hope it digs in and you experience sorrow!
but you'll learn a fake heart does nothing for you.
Blow (Goodbye love) you away....
Every time these people say that they love me,
I don't see...It's all these lies,
It's catastrophic in my eyes but I can feel you bleed.
IT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO TO ME!
They fake every bit of love (for their own) selfish needs...
I don't have any sympathy...
I hate the world for giving you a disease...
I cut myself way too deep inside!
Alleviating all pain and she's asking me why?
Why do I choose to pull away inside?
Everything's already black inside!
I hope you feel this!
From a real wound budding and exposed.
I hope it digs in!
(DIGS IN) Caving in from the weight!
I hope you feel this!
None of that fake heart they gave to you.
I hope it digs in until your heart, it grows!
I hope you feel this!
Out of me and into you!
I hope it digs in and you experience sorrow!
but you'll learn a fake heart does nothing for you.
I hope that you endure more than most!
Because a heart is born out of flames and in the grave.
of what we had and everything here.....
I'll break apart to find, to love, absorb....all of your fumes...
I hope you feel this!
From a real wound budding and exposed.
I hope it digs in!
(DIGS IN) Caving in from the weight!
I hope you feel this!
None of that fake heart they gave to you.
I hope it digs in until your heart, it grows!
I hope you feel this!
Out of me and into you!
I hope it digs in and you experience sorrow!
but you'll learn a fake heart does nothing for you.

Smells of toast and coffee served to put in mind his name today
Never did take much to get me thinking about him anyway
In time I may progress to welcoming the coffee`s scent
At present I have no such strength.
Is there no poetry, no melody to comfort me,
To blur these images, etched upon my memory.
My stereo is where I go to let the sunshine in,
But every note`s like one from him.
All that surrounds me,
Won`t let him go,
All that surrounds me
Won`t let him go.
If falling rain could only wash away my memories
Then I would welcome rain and never let it bother me
From my windowsill I`d watch the drops and then begin
To picture him soaked to the skin.

Our love is like a new car smell
Sooner or later it all goes to hell
Somebody farts or spills some taco bell
Our love is like a new car smell
Our love is like a barbeque ignition
You know that button you push lights the propane emission
It works for a month then the spark goes missing
Our love is like a barbeque ignition
Our love is like a video game
That you play alot and then it gets lame
Then a new one comes out that's better but the same
Our love is like a video game
Our love..
Our love is like a surgical procedure
It's painful and invasive, your insurance won't cover
And when it's done you walk funny forever
Our love is like a surgical procedure
Our love is like a Meatloaf song
It has its moments but it's way too long
Like a bat outta hell it all goes wrong
Our love is like a Meatloaf song
Our love is like Keanu Reeves
Who's made some really bad movies
That's all time you can't retrieve
Our love is like Keanu Reeves
Our love..

JENNIFER GENTLE
There were three sisters, fair and bright,
Jennifer gentle, fair Rosie Marie,
Wanted to wed with a valiant Knight
As the dew flies over the mulberry tree.
The eldest sister took him in,
Also bolted the silver pin.
The second sister made his bed,'
Placed the pillow right under his head.
But the youngest sister, fair and bright,
Wanted to wed with the valiant knight.
Well, if you will answer my questions three,
Then, fair maid, I would marry thee.
Oh, what is whiter than the milk?
What is softer than the silk?
Oh, snow is whiter than the silk;
Down is softer than the silk.
And what is sharper than the thorn?
What is louder than the horn?
Oh, hunger is sharper than the thorn,
Thunder's louder than the horn.
And what is broader than the way?
What is deeper than the sea.
Oh, love is broader than the way;
hell is deeper than the sea.
Well, now you've answered my questions three;
Now, fair maid, I would marry thee.

Heel yo ho, boys; let her go, boys;
Bring her head round, into the weather,
Heave her ho, boys,let her go, boys
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
What care we though, white the Minch is?
What care we for wind or weather?
Let her go boys; every inch is
Sailing homeward to Mingulay.
Wives are waiting, by the pier head,
Or looking seaward, from the heather;
Heave her round, boys, then you'll anchor
'Ere the sun sets on Mingulay.
Ships return now, heavy laden
Mothers holdin' bairns a-cryin'
They'll return, though, when the sun sets
They'll return to Mingulay.

Way up yonder above the sky
A bluebird lived in a jaybird's eye
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go
Buckeye Jim
Way up yonder above the moon
A blue jay nest in a silver spoon
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go
Buckeye Jim
Way down yonder in a wooden trough
An old woman died of the whoopin' cough
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go
Buckeye Jim
Way down yonder in a hollow log
A red bird danced with the green bullfrog
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go
Buckeye Jim

Because of him
This world has hope again
Because of him
This world has got a friend
A friend that will eradicate
All life's false humanity
Helping one race, one creed
To meet their need
So that all may see
That it's all so wonderful to care
To love, to cull, to share
Oh, let us start today
To live and die the same way...

You said you'd win me over
I said you never would
You said you'd wear me down, well,
Never thought you could
So how did you make me love you?
You're not even my type
You tore down my defences
Against my best advice
[Chorus:]
(And) Now you tell you you're leaving
Now you tell me you can't go on
Now you tell me you're leaving
Now you tell me
Now you tell me
I'd built my walls around me
Out of common sense
My natural inclinations
Were my best defence
I thought my heart was safe 'cause
I kept it out of your sight
So how did you steal it from me?
Have I no legal rights?
[Chorus]
I wish I'd never lost my head
I wish I'd stuck to what I said
It wouldn't be me here cryin' now
I suppose I've made my bed
And about those tears I shed
It shouldn't be me here cryin'
It shouldn't be me here cryin'
[Repeat Chorus]

I wish I were on yonder hill
(And) there I'd sit and cry my fill
(And) ev'ry tear would turn a mill
And a blessing walk with you, my love
I'll sell my rod, I'll sell my reel
I'll sell my only spinning wheel
To buy my love a sword of steel
And a blessing walk with you, my love
Siúil siúil siúil a ruin
Siúil go sochair agus siúil go ciuin
Siúil go doras agus ealaigh liom
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan
I wish, I wish and I wish in vain
I wish I had my heart again
And vainly think I'd not complain
And a blessing walk with you, my love
Siúil siúil siúil a ruin
Siúil go sochair agus siúil go ciuin
Siúil go doras agus ealaigh liom
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan
Siúil siúil siúil a ruin
Siúil go sochair agus siúil go ciuin
Siúil go doras agus ealaigh liom
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan
Siúil siúil siúil a ruin
Siúil go sochair agus siúil go ciuin
Siúil go doras agus ealaigh liom
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan
But now my love has gone to France
To try his fortune to advance
If he e'er comes back it's but a chance
And a blessing walk with you, my love
Siúil siúil siúil a ruin
Siúil go sochair agus siúil go ciuin
Siúil go doras agus ealaigh liom
Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan

"Someone is absent," the shepherd said
As over my classbook he bent his head
"For several Sundays absent too
So tell me teacher what did you do?"
"I didn't call as perhaps I should
I sent some cards but they did no good
I never heard and she never came
So I decided to drop her name"
He answered gravely, "The fault was mine
Hundred, no, there were ninety nine
One was lost and dark and cold
I sought that sheep that had left the fold
The path was stony and edged with thorns
My feet were wounded bruised and torn
I kept on searching not counting the cost
And overjoyed when I found the lost"

It being a fine morning, this young man he chose
That he'd make occasion to wear his fine clothes
And it's down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes
To give her a token of his love, we suppose
"Mary, oh Mary, if I could be your man
Between you and danger I fearlessly would stand
With this gold claddagh ring on your lily-white hand
Oh, there ne'er was another would dress you so grand."
There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring
Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring.
"Johnny, oh Johnny the ring it is of gold
And it's hands and fine heart, they are lovely to behold
But if I had the ring for one evening to hold
Then you shall have my answer e'er the week shall be old."
"Oh why have the weeks gone and not an answer came ?
And why is it that women are smarter than men ?
Oh the girl's kept the ring which I shall ne'er see again
Oh, she has many like it in a fine box at hame."
There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring
Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring.
It being a fine morning, this young man he chose
That he'd make occasion to wear his fine clothes
And it's down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes
To give her a token of his love, we suppose
There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring
Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring.
Oh, her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring.

Sing a new song to the world
Let your voice be heard
Go and bring the word
This whole world was meant to be
For you as well as me
For humanity
We all travel the same road
Carry the same load
Reap what we have sowed
You are hoping just like me
To live with dignity
Hoping to be free
Sing out, sing out, sing to the world
Sing out, you will be heard
Sing the message and the word
Sing a new song to the world
Sing out, sing to the world
If your God's the same as mine
Has been for all time
Why are we so blind?
What we're doing in his name
Well, its a crying shame
Sing Out!
We all cry the same

Together we
Together we sing
Together free
Together we

Well I never asked for nothin'
I got nothin' in return
Turn out that there's something
Letters bound and burned
Well I know you think you knew me
Well I thought I knew you too
I guess I was a fool but...
That ain't nothing new
We all fall into... the darkness
oooh the darkness
oooh the darkness
Befor the Dawn
Well I never was wasteful
with the time I had at hand
Guess I had to chase you
So I had to understand
That we all fall into... the darkness
oooh the Darkness
oooh the Darkness
Before the Dawn
So go get out my records
If you take one last request
Tell me that you love me
that you always did your best
So I sense I fell into... the darkness
oooh the darkness
oooh the darkness
oooh the darkness

I've got you under my skin
I have got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so, not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
That ain't no just win
Why not use your mentality
Wake up, step up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
Yea, you grab me under my skin

Did you believe them
When they told you they discovered you
And that everything is free
As long as you do what they tell you to
You think it's true
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
Did you even listen when they told you to change your name
Now nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame
Play the game
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
Play it girl
Play it girl
Play it girl
Does it make you feel good
When they tell you what you want to hear
And after they suck all your soul
Well, that's when they'll disappear
Disappear, disappear for ever
Like a prince in your little fairy tale
And you will find it when they put your soul on sale
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world

So inconsistent with my passion that I threw it all out
I took it from you
You
So apathetic with the forces that I burned them all out
I took it from you, you
So when the water's rushing close
I'll find you near the edge and save you from the meso
Should've known you were gonna find out
You're gonna find out but
Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode, oh no
So covered up in all the fire that I never looked back
I took it from you, you
So agitated from the shadows, can I take it all back, baby
I took it from you, you
Oh, all your pretty mind wants
Is atoms for my bones and ashes for my thoughts
Oh, should've known you were gonna find out
I knew you'd find out but
Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Should've known you were gonna find out
I knew you'd find out but
Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, hey
Walking through the door alone, no
Is it worth the episode, no
Oh
Oh, oh no
Oh
Oh, oh yeah
Is it worth the episode
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode, oh no
Should've known you were gonna find out
(Should've known you were gonna find out)
Should've known you were gonna find out
(I knew you'd find out)

One night as I lay slumbering in my silent bed alone
Some reckless thoughts came to my mind which caused me for to roam
To leave my native country and the wee girl I do adore
So I thought it fit to take a trip, strange lands for to explore
Now the night before I went away I was walking over Brockagh Hill
When I met my darling on the road and her eyes with tears did fill
"Stay you at home dear John" she said "and do not go away
For I'll have none to comfort me when you are on the sea"
Well I took her by the lily white hand and I held her hard and fast
Saying "adieu to you my darling for my ship it lies in Belfast
But if you prove loyal sure I'll prove true for you know that I'm well inclined"
So we kissed goodbye and parted and I left my girl behind
And when we landed in Greenock sure the people all gathered around
And they said I was a rakish lad come to put their harvest down
They told me to return again and never more be seen
So without delay I sailed away for Ireland's lovely green
Sure when Mary heard that John was home her heart did beat with joy
Saying "come into my arms" she cried "you're my darling lovely boy"
Saying "come into my arms" she cried "of you I have thought great and long
And let them all say as they will, our wedding will now go on
And let them all say as they as they will

I read the advice in your letter
To see myself without a filter
So tonight I have locked all my doors
And Im down on all fours
Wild again
The dawnlight is slowly approaching
Eyes open to slow down the spinning
I bet youd be proud of me now
Lost in my own house
I cant find a way out
I used to believe
That shame only came on display
To the others
But I was wrong
Im here by myself and the feeling is strong
Im learning to split into portions
The pain that comes sharp with the morning
I take some with coffee and then
I bring some back to bed
And wait for a dream

I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley
'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, "The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley"
While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley
But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow
And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow
As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley

I am Cow, hear me moo
I weigh twice as much as you
And I look good on the barbecue
Yogurt, curd, cream cheese and butter's
Made from liquid from my udders
I am Cow, I am Cow, Hear me moo (moo)
I am Cow, eating grass
Methane gas comes out my ass
And out my muzzle when I belch
Oh, the ozone layer is thinner
From the outcome of my dinner
I am Cow, I am Cow, I've got gas
I am Cow, here I stand
Far and wide upon this land
And I am living everywhere
From B.C. to Newfoundland
You can squeeze my teats by hand
I am Cow, I am Cow, I am Cow
I am Cow, I am Cow, I am Cow!

Come climb the hill with me
Come and be still with me
Come watch the sun sink away
If you will with me
Come watch the garden grow
Down by the gravel road
Come warm your hands in the gold
Of the afterglow
Into the peace of these wild things,
Into the wild of this grace,
Into the grace of this blessing,
Speak in the peace of this place
Come walk the cedar stand
Over the broken dam
Sit on the bench at the bend in the trail again
Look how the children laugh
Out in the tumble grass
Bright as a fire and as fine as a photograph
CHORUS
Here at the magic hour
Time and eternity
Mingle a moment in chorus
Here at the magic hour
Bright is the mystery
Plain is the beauty before us
Could this beauty be for us?
What is this voice that sings
Holy and hovering
Over this hill in the still of the evening?
(Son of God, speak)

Johnny lived next door to me and Paul lived down the block
We'd meet each day at my house, sharp at six o'clock
We'd race our bikes to school and Paul would always win
Johnny said that's 'cause we're nine and Paul had just turned to ten
First day of high school on my way to my first class
Three football players said, "They wouldn't let me pass"
I set my books down and I rolled up my sleeves
And then I noticed there was two boys next to me
It was me and John and Paul
Best friends you ever saw
All for one and one for all
It was me and John and Paul
I wonder why they call it graduation day
Its more like a funeral or youth that's passed away
Paul said, "He's leaving for the army in two weeks"
Johnny said, "Lets go to town and make the memories"
It was me and John and Paul
Best friends you ever saw
All for one and one for all
It was me and John and Paul
Years later, I heard Paul came back from the Gulf War
I flew up to Tennessee to visit him once more
It didn't shock me, none to hear that he'd been brave
He'd lost his own life but another one was saved
I waited by a tree till everyone had left
I went up and said a prayer where my pal slept
And then I heard a voice I hadn't heard in years
I didn't need to turn around I knew just who was there
It was me and John and Paul
Best friends you ever saw
All for one and one for all
It was me and John and Paul
It was me and John and Paul
Best friends you ever saw
All for one and one for all
It was me and John and Paul

Guess who I saw in Paris
Guess who I saw in Paris
Standing in the street with his thumbs hooked in his belt
Standing with his thumbs hooked in his belt
Standing in the street with his thumbs hooked in his belt
Looking all of seventeen
Guess who invited him up to her room
Guess who made him some tea
Guess who got spaced with him, played his guitar
Guess who fell asleep on his arm
Guess who got lost in his eyes
Guess who kissed him goodnight
Guess who phoned me up this morning while I was still asleep
Not like waking up at all
La da da da da da
Been dreaming of

Stay awake my enslaved mind
You will be solved again and do whatever they want
Turn away my shut-in heart
You heard the voice down there
Keeps resounding in your skull
Away off shore
Drifting reverse the course
Where's the hill I belong
What makes wings heal, makes them grow
Where's the dream I split off and float
Flames rise over to blind
And these tame owls will never fly that high
Roll your falling and loaded dice
You're drifting and pulling the sky
But there will be time to face it

Don't need to kiss you
though I know it would be good
don't need to hug you,
but sometimes I wish I could
don't mean to do with you
what just would not be right
just need the thought of you
to get me through the night
Just the thought of you
keeps a sparkle in my eye
(choirs)... Just the thought of you
Just the thought of you
is just enough to get me by
(choirs)... Just the thought of you
a wrong way to feel
a reason to smile
the thought of you
is keeping me alive
(choirs)... just the thought of you
(choirs)... just the thought of you
don't need to be untrue
in any kind of way
(choirs)... kind of way
don't wanna hurt the one
i promise to obey
((choirs)... to obey)
don't need to let em know
don't need to break his heart
((choirs)... to break his heart)
just need to think of you
when the days were torn apart
it's the thought of you
that keeps a sparkle in my eye
(choirs)... Just the thought of you
it's the thought of you
just enough to get me by
(choirs)... Just the thought of you
it's a wrong way to feel
a reason to smile
is the thought of you
is keeping me alive
ohh if things have been different and
i've known you before
it might have been good,
it might have had more
or maybe we've end up
thinking to much
about people we like
to be thinking about
about people we like
to be thinking about
it's the thought of you
that keeps a sparkle in my eye
(choirs)... just the thought of you
just the thought of you
is just enough to get me by
(choirs)... Just the thought of you
it's a wrong way to feel
a reason to smile
is the thought of you

All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo
The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old coyote howls
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
Listen to the top where the little birds sing
On the melodies with the high notes ringing
The hoot owl hollers over everything
And the jaybird disagrees
Singin' in the night time, singing in the day
The little duck quacks, then he's on his way
The 'possum ain't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
It's a simple song of living sung everywhere
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly gear
The grumpy alligator the the hawk above
The sly raccoon and the turtle dove
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now

It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay
She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu
He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America
Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing
"Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America
If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more
Then fare you well, sweet Craigie Hill, where often times I've roved
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more
Now we're sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion
And the bonny boats are sailing, way down by Doorin shore

The Lowlands of Holland
The love that I have chosen was to my heart's content.
The salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent.
Repent it I shall never until the day I die
But the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and I.
The very night we got married and lay upon our bed
A pressgang came to my bedside and stood at my bedhead
Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,
To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in *
Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree
Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament
Is there ne'er a lad in our town can give your heart content?
There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me
For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me
*or (It's a wild inhabitation for my true love to be in)
There shall no mantle cross my back, no comb go through my hair
No firelight nor candlelight shall ease my heart's despair
And I will never married be until the day I die
For the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and me

I ain't got nothin' to hide

I got both feet on the ground
I ain't got no one for hire
I ain't got a thing to show

So don't go foolin' around
And set my wheels afire
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul

Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you
Down in the black of a bottomless hole
There's a few good second hand scenes
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue

(Verse 1)
She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come (and she'll say to him)
She's saying
(Chorus)
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where
we belong
So would you be my baby
Ooh-ooh
(Verse 2)
She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was colour-blind
All her friends they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream) just saying
(CHORUS x2)
Mamma never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come (and she'll say to him)
She's saying
(REPEAT CHORUS TWICE)

Who can tell just how it starts
Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the anger's gone
And we forget who's right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I
Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what we've done
And so we cling together now
And wonder why we're oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe in happy endings
You and I

I've unravveled green tangles
with talons dirty of earth
I've pulled up, lacerated,
I've moulded me like mud
I've dug, removed tumuls and roots
I was rooted to the earth
I've modulated me in the deep slow flowing
of the underground seasons
I've taken shape like a shrub dilating my limbs,
I've disentangled from the womb of the earth like
a wild weed
I rise primigenial livid daughter of creation
I rise primigenial livid daughter of creation

The Band Played Waltzing Matilda, Eric Bogle
When I was a young man I carried me pack
And I lived the free life of the rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in 1915 my country said: Son,
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
When the ship pulled away from the quay
And amid all the tears, flag waving and cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli
It well I remember that terrible day
When our blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that hell they call Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk, he was ready, he primed himself well
He rained us with bullets, and he showered us with shell
And in five minutes flat, we were all blown to hell
He nearly blew us back home to Australia
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
When we stopped to bury our slain
Well we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
Then it started all over again
Oh those that were living just tried to survive
In that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive
While around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head
And when I awoke in me hospital bed
And saw what it had done, I wished I was dead
I never knew there was worse things than dying
Oh no more I'll go Waltzing Matilda
All around the green bush far and near
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me
They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And when the ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was no one there waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the Band played Waltzing Matilda
When they carried us down the gangway
Oh nobody cheered, they just stood there and stared
Then they turned all their faces away
Now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Renewing their dreams of past glories
I see the old men all tired, stiff and worn
Those weary old heroes of a forgotten war
And the young people ask "What are they marching for?"
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year, their numbers get fewer
Someday, no one will march there at all
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by the billabong
So who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?

The snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the corn it ripens fastest when the frost is setting in
And when the young man tells me that my face he'll soon forget
Before we part I bet a crown, he'd be fain to follow it yet
And the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the swallow skims without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring blows and winter goes my love then you'll be free
With all your pride and to follow me where it crossed the stormy sea
And the snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter he won't sing
And all the flowers in all the land so brightly they may be.
And the snow it melts the soonest when my true love's for me.
So whoever says to me farewell here, no farewell I receive,
For you will leave me at your side, or you kiss and take your leave
And I'll wait here 'til the moorcock calls and the Martin takes his leave
For the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing.

Sleep, O babe, for the red bee hums the silent twilight's fall
Eeval from the grey rock comes to wrap the world in thrall
A lyan van o, my child, my joy, my love and heart's desire
The crickets sing you lullaby beside the dying fire
Dusk is drawn and the Green Man's thorn is wreathed in rings of fog
Sheevra sails his boat 'til morn upon the starry bog
A lyan van o, the paly moon hath brimm'd her cusp in dew
And weeps to hear the sad, sleep tune I sing, o love, to you
Sleep, O babe, for the red bee hums the silent twilight's fall
Eeval from the grey rock comes to wrap the world in thrall
A lyan van o, my child, my joy, my love and heart's desire
The crickets sing you lullaby beside the dying fire

David had an eagle tatooed on his right arm
He got it back in high school, when we were working on the farm
He's still got that arrowhead we found when we were kids
And I knew we would be like brothers, well just as long as we both lived
I still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
Stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
You were the handsome cowboy, I the trusty brave
We were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved
Well for some it just comes so easy
For others seems its bread in the bones
But we danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one we heard at home
I went to the mountains, I was reaching for the sun
I was on fire for leaving, this angry battle I thought I'd won
David dug his trenches, he fought his war at home
My mountain soon was crumbling, God I was all alone
Well for some it just comes so easy
And for others its bread in their bones
But I danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
It was years before the smoke cleared, I could come back home again
Look my father in the eyes, I could finally let him in
For he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
And I knew the day they understood because David was my friend
Well for some you know it comes so easy
And for others seems its bread in their bones
But I still danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
I will always dance to the beat of a different drum
For the warrior has come home

The Real Old Mountain Dew
Beside a hill there is a still,
Where the smoke runs up to the sky;
You ean always tell by the whiff and the smell
That the liquor boys are nigh.
Refrain:
That the liquor boys are nigh,
That the liquor boys are nigh,
You ean always tell by the whiff and the smell,
That the liquor boys are nigh.
This mountain dew is made from grain,
And mixed with water pure,
And the alcohol that it eontains
Will all your troubles cure.
Refrain:
Will all your troubles cure,
Will all your troubles cure,
And the alcohol that it contains
Will all your troubles eure.
AII learned men who use the pen
Have writ its praises high;
It fills the air with perfume rare
Distilled with wheat and rye.
Refrain:
Distilled with wheat and rye,
Distilled with wheat and rye,
It fills the air with perfume rare
Distilled with wheat and rye.
Away with pills,'twill cure the ills
Of Pagan, Christian and Jew,
Off with your coat and wet your throat
With the real old mountain dew.
Refrain:
With the real old mountain dew,
With the real old mountain dew,
Off with your coat and wet your throat
With the real old mountain dew.
So before we roll won't you have another bowl
Of the good old mountain dew?
Of the good old mountain dew?
Of the good old mountain dew?
Refrain:
Of the good old mountain dew?
Of the good old mountain dew?
So before we roll won't you have another bowl
Of the good old mountain dew?
WE DO

The wine it was drunk, the ship it was sunk,
The shot it was dead, all the sorrows were drowned.
The birds they were clouds, the brides and the shrouds
And as we drew south the mist it came down.
The wooded ravine to the wandering stream,
The serpent he moved, but no-one would say.
The depths of the waters, the bridge which distraught us
And brought to me thoughts of the ill-fated day.
The temples were filled with the strangest of creatures
One played it by ear on the banks of the sea.
That one was found but the others they went under.
Oh the tears which are shed, they won't come from me.
The methods of madness, the pathos and the sadness,
God help you all, the insane and wise.
The black and the white, the darkness of the night,
I see only smoke from the chimneys arise.

I remember once I broke down in the country
I was sixteen with a broken heart in bloom
And I walked home through the pines
Nobody saw me but the moon
By sunrise I could hear the church bells ringing
I got there as the saints were marching in
I sat down on the back row
And heard the story once again
And the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
And all at once I saw the shadows flee
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet
They flew us down to Oklahoma City
Yeah, but I could hardly stand there on the stage
So sick I couldn't speak
And the fever wouldn't break
But when I stepped up to the microphone I heard it
It was the voices of the brothers at my side
They were singing out my song
When the song in me had died
Oh, shine your light on me
Somebody come and get me when I'm gone
Two years ago I drove into a darkness
I straightened every curve on Cane Ridge Road
And I could hear the flapping wings
Of every devil I have known
And the inside of my car was like a casket
But then it flooded with a blaze of sacred light
She was calling me back home
And as I pulled into the drive
I knew the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
She was standing on the porch where I could see
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet

We search for everything
Keeping what we would win
Orchids or tiny flowers
Wooden huts or ivory towers
Centuries or hours
Dark are the winter days
Holy in many ways
Vaults of time unshaken
Whilst as through them we are taken
Sleeping forests wake
Ice melts on the lake
Birds begin in making their way back home
The frost and the fire goes
East winds and winter snows
Sun upon the daffodils
Dancing on the verdant hills
Lambs in the fields
Warmer grows the morning sun
Days of youthfulness and fun
The prime of the year begun
The song of summer to be sung
Everything is one
Working day is done
Watch the river running through our lives
How slowly the colors change
We feel the drops of rain
Mists of evening rise again
We rarely stroll the shadowed lanes
As autumn night draws in
We sit upon the sand
Warmth draining from the land
Watching the ruby sun
Setting on the ocean
The echoes in the caves
The flame upon the waves
Memories for saving all our days

Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short
He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt
I took good care of him for he had no family
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be
Johnny often liked to go out on the town
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped
As if trying to think of something but having no luck
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair
I said, "Johnny where's your cranium?" but he didn't seem to know
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead
Refusing to believe that he had split for good
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad
Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body
(I ain't got nobody)
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face

This is what I wanted
A chance for a better life than this
A life that I can't get if I'm stuck here on dry land
And when we're on the open sea
I'll take my secrets write them down for you to see
Tear them to shreds and then I'll throw them overboard
I'll watch my words fade into the tide
When the anchor drops for the last time I'll be free
And I know that I'll be miserable
When the hurricanes become unbearable
And when the lines get tangled up
And the nets are torn apart
Having turned into the wind
And the crashing waves they knock me from my feet
I hope you'll remember me
When this boy becomes a man
If I never make it home
Just know I didn't die alone
Pretending this is all I want to say
Even if I'm turned into the wind
Pretending this is all I want to say as you cry this is good bye
Pretending this is all i want to say
Even though i've turned into the wind
Pretending this is all i want to say
It's not all i want to say
It's not all i want to say
That's all there is to say...

I saw a big dog
I saw a bigger dog
I saw the biggest dog of all

An Ulsterman I am proud to be
>From the Antrim Glens I come.
Although I labour by the sea
I have followed flag and drum.
I have heard the martial tramp of men
I've seen them fight and die.
Ah, lads, I well remember when
I followed Henry Joy.
I pulled my boat up from the sea
I hid my sails away,
I hung my nets on a greenwood tree
And I scanned the moonlit bay.
The boys were out, and the Redcoats too,
I kissed my wife goodbye;
And in the shade of the greenwood glade
I followed Henry Joy. "
In Antrim town the tyrant stood,
He tore our ranks with ball,
But with a cheer and a pike to clear
We swept them o'er the wall.
Our pikes and sabres flushed that day,
We won, but lost, ah, why?
No matter lads, I fought beside
And shielded Henry Joy.
Ah, boys, for Ireland's cause we fought;
For her and home we bled,
Though our pikes were few still our hearts beat true,
And five to one lay dead,
And many a lassie mourned her lad,
And mother mourned her boy;
For youth was strong in that gallant throng
Who followed Henry Joy.

Layin up in bed, all night with you again
Yeah we hide from the next day
Cos we know we know that I,
in the end I really can't stay
Pleasure & pain are both the same and love is just a losing game
Wanting to give it all but 'fraid to lose it if it falls apart
We hold each other, but we hold back
Yeah we enclose each other, then we step back
I can see it in your eyes, you need to hold on to your life
Not run away in my dreams of paradise
You're wise, you say that I'm
A Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man
Today I'm yours but tomorrow when I'm gone, you'll understand
Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man
Holding me mama can't you see's like a hand full of sand
So now before I go away
If I could seal your heart
Keep inside the feelings of today, I'd be
Keeping the fire burning til the moment I return to see you
But the only problem is I cannot promise anything
We hold each other, but we hold back
Yeah we enclose each other, then we step back
I can see it in your eyes, you need to hold on to your life
Not run away in my dreams of paradise
You're wise, you say that I'm
A Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man
Today I'm yours but tomorrow when I'm gone, you'll understand
Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man
Holding me mama can't you see's like a hand full of sand

Come all you young rebels,
And list' while I sing.
For the love of one's country is a terrible thing.
It banishes fear with the the speed of a flame
And it makes us all part of the patriot game.
My name is O'Hanlon,
And I'm just gone sixteen,
My home is in Monohan,
Where I was weened,
I've learned all my life through,
When England to blame,
And so I'm a part of the patriot game.
It's barely two years since I wondered away,
With the local battalion of the bold I-R-A,
I've read of our heroes and I've wanted the same,
To play out my part in the patriot game.
This Ireland of ours has for long been half free,
Six counties are under John Bull's tyranny,
So I gave up my boyhood to drill and to train,
To play my own part in the patriot game.

I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town
And they said that you couldn't sit on a cloud, cause you'd fall right through
Well how is it then, that I managed to?
And how did I say what I just said to you?
Am I thinking out loud, did you even ask me to?
I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town
And the streets are empty how, but for the wrong reasons
They've all gone and left me alone
And they left with a vengance, and they talk of their experience
And they'll try and convince me, to join them
Holy, Holy
Holy is the only word I know these days
Holy, Holy
Holy is the only word I know these days
Those flowers have never experienced anything like this before
They've been picked from their wilderness, put in a jar
Now they're feeling the heat of this room
And I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town
Falling like a star
I only came down for a day, I didn't want to stay
Falling like a star
I only came down for a day, I didn't want to stay

Coming Into certain lines of justice
A venue for a Venus and Eve
Take the balance of their beauty between them
A vain look can deceive
I'm only paying court to love
As deep as you can find
On the blind side of your heart
Safe inside your mind
When the length of days are dawning
It feels right, in the light of understanding
There's always something bound to be a warning
When it's infinite it never meets
I'm only paying court to love
As deep as you could wish to find
On the blind side of your heart
Safe inside your mind

This is really not my home
Oh where are you my lovely Johnny?
I'm afraid and all alone
There is no peace for me
I'm sitting in the stranger's room
Playing at the stranger's table
Shining empty like the moon
There is no peace for me
Chorus:
But in the darkness struggle cold
I think about a garden valley
Gentle as the leaves unfold
Singing out across the bay
Distant and so far away
There is no peace for me
I'm blinded by your city lights
I wander through these fearful places
The colours fade to black and white
There is no peace for me
And these are not the friends I know
These are not their smiling faces
A desert that no-one should know
There is no peace for me
Chorus
Now I know and feel it well
Poor immigrants deep sunken feeling
Standing at the gates of Hell
There is no peace for me
Burned out by their master's greed
Cruel exile transportation
Robbed of every love and need
There is no peace for me
Chorus

There's a hitchhiker standing on the side
Of the road off of exit 104
And a forgotten billboard for all night diner
That ain't even there no more
Three deserted farms just like monuments
Standing cold and still
While a hawk and a lonely state trooper
Stand guard out on lookout hill
I'm just following the road home on a trail of memories
Just a battle weary native son is there still a home for me
When you see me coming don't you turn away
'Cause this hometown boy needs a place to stay
And a little understanding on the road home
On the road home
There's still mud on my boots from across the sea
And I ain't gonna kick it off
'Cause it makes me remember what I need to forget
When I'm feeling lonesome and lost
And there's a river of scars and it's running deep
Right down to my very soul
And this battle rages every step of the way
While I try not to let it show
I'm just following the road home on a trail of memories
Just a battle weary native son is there still a home for me
When you see me coming don't you turn away
'Cause this hometown boy needs a place to stay
And a little understanding on the road home
On the road home
When you see me coming don't you turn away
'Cause this hometown boy needs a place to stay
And a little understanding on the road home
On the road home
I'm on the road home

Where are you tonight I wonder
And where will you be tonight when I cry?
Will sleep for you come easy,
Though I alone can't slumber
Will you welcome in the morning
At another man's side?
How easy for you the years slipped under
And left me a shadow the sun can't dispel
I built for you a tower of love and admiration
But I set you so high I could not reach myself.
I look through my window at a world filled with strangers
The face in my mirror is the one face I know
You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger
My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know
If there is a silence then it can be broken
If there beats a pure heart to her I will go
And time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger
Ah, but in the meantime I'd still like to know.

The Lord above
saved his only son
To spread the word of God
to everyone
Jesus cured the lepers, aw
And he healed the lame
But he left the bald men
with their pain
Oh my Lord
I lost what I had
I've suffered the fate
Of my old dad
I've looked in the hills
In the valleys everywhere
But I cannot see why
You took my hair
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
What was on my head (above I saw)
Is no longer there (losin' my hair)
When you see the light
It's my forehead's glare
Oh, don't you care (hey you up there)
I'm losin' my hair (yeah, yeah)
I've tried to pray
And I've tried to grieve
I've tried the wig
And I've tried the weave
I've tried the transplant
And I've tried the graft
But my hair
Is thin and fat
Oh my good Lord
Why'd you take my hair?
Are You making a carpet
For heaven's stairs
To warm the feet
Of the chosen souls?
But in the meantime,
My head's getting cold!
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
What was on my head (above I saw)
Is no longer there (losin' my hair)
When you see the light
It's my forehead's glare
Oh, don't you care (hey you up there)
That I'm losin' my hair (yeah, yeah)
We are your children
And we are blessed
But most of my hair
Is now on my chest
In Your old wisdom
You took it off my head
Why couldn't you
Just rob me blind instead?
Oh Lord above
On Judgement Day
Will you forgive me
For my toupee
And when I march
Through the gates a-pearl
Can I have hair in
Your afterworld?
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
What was on my head (above I saw)
Is no longer there (losin' my hair)
When you see the light
It's my forehead's glare
Oh, don't you care (hey you up there)
I'm losin' my hair (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm losin' my hair, I'm losin' my hair
But I know a lot of other people out there are losin'
their hair too.
And I know every night, you pray to God, don't you?
Yeah, you do, don't you?
You pray to God to give you more hair!
You wake up the next morning, you go in that shower,
you look in that drain...
There's your hair. It ain't on your head no more.
But you know, maybe your call's just not getting through.
God's a busy man, and a lot of people try to get him on
the intergalactic telephone.
But maybe, maybe if we all pray together, we'll get God's
phone to ring! Thank you.
So gimme an amen (amen)
Amen (amen)
C'mon AMEN (amen)
AMEN (amen)
Oh yeah, the phone is ringin', the phone is ringin', God's
pickin' it up. I think we might have woken him up, he might
be a little bit grumpy, but it doesn't matter, 'cause we're
gonna tell him what we want, aren't we? (yeah) Aren't we?
(yeah)
I need help for my scalp (help for my scalp)
Oh give me help for my scalp (help for my scalp)
Oh yeah, I'm feeling the power, the power of the Lord.
It's in me! It's all around me! This man, this man
has split ends on the end of his head. Let those split
ends be healed!
(Miracle...follicle...miracle...follicle...)
Oh my Lord
Up on your throne
I gotta know
Do you use a comb?
Is your hair wavy?
Is your hair blonde?
Is it curly?
Or is it GONE?
Is to be bald
To be divine
'Cause all the monks
Have heads that shine
If that's your way
Then I don't care
I'd sell my soul to
Get more hair!
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
What was on my head (above I saw)
Is no longer there (losin' my hair)
When you see the light
It's my forehead's glare
Oh, don't you care (hey you up there)
I'm losin' my hair (yeah, yeah)
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
I'm losin' my hair (losin' my hair)
What was on my head (above I saw)
Is no longer there (losin' my hair)
When you see the light
It's my forehead's glare
Oh, don't you care (hey you up there)
I'm losin' my hair (yeah, yeah)
Oh, don't you care
Oh, don't you care
I'm losin' my hair

Everybody is saying that you are right.
But only I, know the truth about you.
You'd rather see me dead and starved
Yes it's true.
You're as hard as stone and as cold as ice.
And you're going to get what's coming to you
If you don't take my advice.
You get what you can,
while the going is good.
but you know in your mind, you're pushing me
far more than you should...
Right now, my happiness only comes from pretending
Because you've already stomped on my pride,
which I should be defending.
I let you get away with what you did,
I was only being very, very nice.
But you had to take me for someone who's stupid...
You know, I don't like to prove my fights.
Because time,
will show the truth of the matter,
that my kindness was to flatter,
and only to flatter.
I'm not saying that I'm any kind of liar
but why should I let you step on me?
Just to get yourself higher.

I've always known
Since I was a young boy
In this world, everything's as good as bad
Now my father told me always speak a true word
And I have to say that is the best advice I've had
Because something burns inside of me
It's everything I long to be
And lies they only stop me from feeling free
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
I've never yearned for anybody's fortune
The less I have the more I am a happy man
Now my mother told me always keep your head on
Because some may praise you just to get what they want
And I said mama I am not afraid
They will take what they will take
And what would life be like without a few mistakes
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me

I've been a Wild Rover for many's the Year
And I spend all my money on Whiskey and Beer
And now I'm returning with Gold in great store
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no,nay,never
no,nay,never no more
will I play the Wild Rover
no,never no more
I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told my Landlady my Money was spent
I asked her for Credit She answered me nay
Such a Custom as yours I could have any day
And it's no,nay,never.....
I took from my pocket ten Sovereigns bright
And the Landlady's eyes opened up with delight
She said she had Whiskeys and Wines of the best
And the words that She tolt me were only in jest
And it's no,nay,never.....
I went home to my Parents confest what I'd done
And I asked them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they'd caressed me as oft times before
I never will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no,nay,never.....

Back in my schooldays, acting the fool days
One and one and one is three
And the man said, Hey, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time
Armor-clad forces, riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
Sly man stumbles, twists and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way? Can't you go that way?
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
So who wants a riot? People should be quiet
Don't we give them good TV?
You can learn to love your lifetime of distraction
Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
All the way from A to Z
I can live without that kind of satisfaction
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red

I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now, most of my days I spend alone
Thousand miles, place I was born
When she wakes me, she takes me back home
Now, most days, I spend like a child
Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind
I know there ain't nothin' out there
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now, most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles, place I was born
When she wakes me, she takes me back home
A thousand miles, place I was born
When she wakes me, she takes me back home
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now, most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles, place I was born
When she wakes me, she takes me
Ya, when she wakes me, she takes me
Ya, when she wakes me, she takes me back home
When she wakes me, she takes me back home

We built a glass monastery
Over the fault lines
Traded our lives for a living
In the shade of fallen shrines
You wrote your name in the static
Ten thousand gray dots
Couldn't decipher your message
Oh, but I felt the violet noise
And the white lies, I'm fading
'Til my mouth dries, I'm praying
I can hold my liquor like the saints do
I'm counting, I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you
Hey, I'm counting on, I'm counting on you
I lost my pride in the crater, hey
And ancient coal mines
Emulsified in dishonor
I just couldn't keep myself alive
In the white lies, I'm fading
'Til my mouth dries, I'm praying
I can hold my liquor like the saints do
I'm counting, I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you
Oh, I'm counting on you
Oh, I'm counting on, I'm counting on you
Oh I never, no I never, never thought we'd live in churches
And I never, no I never, no I never meant to see them burn
And I know you didn't, know you didn't, no, you didn't deserve it, hey but
Now I'm, I'm counting, I'm counting on you
Oh no, babe
I can hold my liquor like the saints do
Just like they do
I'm counting, I'm counting on you
And the white lies, I'm fading
'Til my mouth dries, I'm praying
I can hold my liquor like the saints do
I'm counting, I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you
Oh, I'm counting on you
Hey, I'm counting on, I'm counting on you

You hang there on the wall
You've carved out your place
But I can tell you shake from inside
I see it all the time
The feel is always there
Just frozen in your mind from inside
I wasn't gonna play it tonight
But I can't help it
The feelings alive
As long as you play my game
I'll let you win
Before your entrance wave
Before we play this game
I like to feel you break from inside
You're gold and pink inside
And it's showing through your stare
It's frozen us in time from inside
I wasn't gonna play it tonight
But I can't help it
The feelings alive
As long as you play my game
I'll let you win
Come play my game
I'll let you win
I wasn't gonna play it tonight
But I can't help it
The feelings alive
As long as you play my game
I'll let you win

High is the moon tonight
Hiding it's guiding light, high
Heaven and earth do sleep, still in the dark so deep
I will the darkness sweep
I will the moon to flight, I will the heaven's bright
I will the earth to light
Open your eyes with me, see paradise with me
Awake and arise with me
I am the dawn, I'm the new day begun
I bring you the morning, I bring you the sun
I hold back the night and I open the skies
I give light to the world, I give sight to your eyes
From the first of all time, until time is undone
Forever and ever and ever and ever
And I am the dawn and the sky and the sun
I am one with the one and I am the dawn

Near to Banbridge Town, in the County DownOne morning in July,Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen,And she smiled as she passed me by;Oh, she looked so neat from her two white feetTo the sheen of her nut-brown hair,Sure the coaxing elf, I'd to shake myselfTo make sure I was standing there
CHORUS: Oh, from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay,And from Galway to Dublin town,No maid I've seen like the brown colleenThat I met in the County Down.
As she onward sped I shook my headAnd I gazed with a feeling quare,And I said, says I, to a passer-by,"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"Oh, he smiled at me, and with pride says he,"That's the gem of Ireland's crown,She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,She's the Star of the County Down."
I've travelled a bit, but never was hitSince my roving career began;But fair and square I surrendered thereTo the charms of young Rose McCann.I'd a heart to let and no tenant yetDid I meet with in shawl or gown,But in she went and I asked no rentFrom the Star of the County Down.
At the crossroads fair I'll be surely thereAnd I'll dress in my Sunday clothesAnd I'll try sheep's eyes, and deludhering liesOn the heart of the nut-brown Rose.No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yokeThough with rust my plow turns brown,Till a smiling bride by my own firesideSits the Star of the County Down.

hide your love, don't be shy
be yourself, sell a lie
heed the call, take the lead
follow them, set the scene
in my bones, in the dark
within my soul there you are
here we live no shadows cast
before its lost hide your love
when you're near its not enough
in the clear and in the dark
i can feel it when we touch
cold and hot, hide your love
we can't run, we can't steer
so who am i to dry the tears
in this house, in our room
the heart attacks and drags me to you
in my bones in the dark
within my soul there you are
here we live, no shadows cast
before its lost hide your love
Oh OH Oh OH oh oh
in my bones, in the dark
within my soul there you are
when you're near its not enough
in the clear and in the dark
i can feel it when we touch
cold and hot, hide your love
in my bones in the dark
within my soul there you are

I'll take your photo in my hand
Turn it up and inside out
Till there's nothing in between
I wish that could be me
You look fine together
I'll run in circles in my head
And base my thoughts on
What you've said
That I could never be like him
I could never play the part
You work well together
If you say that you know me
You never knew me at all
So I'll rewrite the story
So they won't ever find me
and we'll fall together
I'll sing again, I'll sing out loud
I'll do my best to please the crowd
My vocals cracked and in repair
The notes are frayed, torn to tear
Go without me

The Wind doth blow today my love,
A few small drops the rain.
Never have i had but one true love,
In cold clay she is lain.
I'll do as much for my true love,
As any young man may.
I'll sit and mourn all on her grave,
A twelve month and a day.
The twelve month and a day been gone,
A voice spoke from the deep.
"Who is it sits all on my grave.
And will not let me sleep?"
Tis I Tis I thine own true love,
Who site upon your grave,
For I crave one kiss from your sweet lips,
And that is all i seek.
"You crave one kiss from my clay cold lips,
But my breath is earthy strong.
Had you one kiss from my clay cold lips,
You're time would not be long"
My time be long, my time be short,
Tomorrow or today,
May God in heaven have all my soul
But I'll kiss you lips of clay.
See down in yonder garden green.
Love where we used to walk.
The sweetest flower that ever grew.
Is withered to the stalk.
The stalk is withered dry sweetheart,
So will our hearts decay.
So make yourself content, my love,
'Til death calls you away

It's early in the morning, way before dawn
I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on
Get down to the water, before all the crowds
Gonna have more fun than the law allows
With my hot rod, I go out to prove
When I'm on the prowl, I never lose
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down
'Cause I've got the fastest fishing boat in town
I open up my tackle box, it's so big!
Crank baits, sink baits, beer and jigs
Got my bobbers on, and my 10 pound test
Gonna catch me a lunker gonna be the best
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts
Ahhh, fishing!
I fish on the lake, by the sunken tree stump
Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree
It's a good thing that fish can't read
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts
Ahhh, fishing!
I feel something tugging on the end of my line
(Tug, tug, tug, tug, tug that line)
I'm gonna catch a fish, it's gonna be so fine
(Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish so fine)
Oh it feels so good to touch fish slime
(Slime, slime, slime, slime, fishy slime)
There's nothing else to do with my free time
(Time, time, time, time, waste of time)

Bonny, bonny was my seat in the red rosy yard
And bonny was my ship in the town of Ballynagard
Shade and shelter was for me till I began to fail
You all may guess now my distress lies near the Nightingale
Grief and woe that I must go to fight for England's King
I neither know his friend or foe, and war's a cruel thing
The nightingale is near at hand, my time at home is brief
And Carey's steams and mountain land I part with bitter grief
No more I'll walk the golden hills with Nancy by my side
Or dream along the sun bright rills, or view my land with pride
We sail away at dawn of day, the sails are ready set
When old Benmore I see no more, I'll sigh with deep regret
Now all must change and I must range across the ocean wide
Our ship she may in Biscay's Bay lie low beneath the tide
If I should fall by cannon ball, or sink beneath the sea
Good people all, a tear let fall and mourn for mine and me

You kept good form.
and you're my black earth!
You swallow everything.
Angels cry...the eyes lie....
Hey pretty girl!
How you feel?
My black earth!
Love the way the capillaries burst.
Up in flames......when you move.
Hey pretty girl!
How you feel?
Can't gauge anything from him...
The way the capillaries burst, under skin.
She is the black earth.
Show the true reflections within.
The open air.
It's hard to gauge when you're out there.
and you're alone......
You can't gauge him, no way to talk him down.
Hey pretty girl!
How you feel?
My black earth!
Love the way the capillaries burst.
Up in flames......when you move.
Hey pretty girl!
How you feel?
Can't gauge anything from him...
The way the capillaries burst, under skin.
She is the black earth.
Show the true reflections within.
I tried to give you everything. Never thought it would be like this.
I tried my hardest to keep in the sin. Not much further you got to go....
I couldn't change. You're in the door way.
Do you want any memories? You're such a fucking pain.
I couldn't change. You're in the door way.
Do you want any memories? You're such a fucking pain.
My Black Earth, Black Earth....
Hey pretty girl!
How you feel?
My black earth!
Love the way the capillaries burst.
Up in flames......when you move.
Hey pretty girl!
How you feel?
Can't gauge anything from him...
The way the capillaries burst, under skin.
She is the black earth.
Show the true reflections within.

When I look at you How could you look at me? I'm thinking now all that you are Is much more than I'll ever be. It seems today, I'll never catch a break. I'm feeling like all that I am Is all the mistakes that I've made.
You're you far away Inside of memories, but when I listen you say
What do you have to fear when you're left all alone? In the darkest of days, when the night's growing cold, you're safe in the arms of a love all your own. In the darkest of your days, there's a love that you should know.
I remember when We were innocent, now they're telling us All that we are Is all of the places we've been. When the seconds slow And you're standing on your own, you'll start coming back Into the arms of love that you should've known.
When you're feeling lost and your hope is gone, your scars never seem to fade. But there is more to you - there is more to me.
The past doesn't change a thing.

The great flood of tears that we've cried
For our brothers and sisters who've died
Over five hundred years has washed away our fears
And strengthened our pride, now we turn back the tide
We will no longer hear your command
We will slide your control from our lands
Re-direct the flame of our anger and pain
And pity the shame, for what you do in God's name
And we will stand for the right to be free
And we will rebuild our own society
And we will sing, we will sing,
We will sing our own song
When the ancient drum rhythms ring
The voice of our forefathers sings
The will to live will beat on, we will no longer be pawns
To greed and to war, We will be Idle No More
And we will stand for the right to be free
And we will rebuild a just society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song
(Northern Cree Singers)
And we will stand for the right to be free
And we will rebuild a just society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song
When the ancient drum rhythms ring
The voice of our grandmothers sings
Native America run, we will no longer succumb
To oil and to ore, we will be Idle No More
And we will stand for the right to be free
And we will rebuild our own society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song
And we will teach about the right to be free
And we will rebuild our own society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song
Dance,dance for the right to be free
We will rebuild our own society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song
And occupy for the right to be free
And we will rebuild a just society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song
(Northern Cree Singers)

When all is said and done,
You are the only one.
Shutters on the windows,
Chains upon the door,
Sleepless nights, been waiting for an answer,
Dreams of Heaven falling,
Panic in the town,
Lonely men with fingers on the future.
When all is said and done,
You are the only one.
Follow on,
For the open road is waiting,
Like the sun,
We will welcome what tomorrow has to bring.
Be it fair or stormy weather,
Take my hand,
And we'll walk the road together,
I won't mind,
If it turns out that we never find the end,
'Cause all I ask is that,
You want me as a friend.
Days of beauty calling,
Vanish through a haze,
Lost inside some spiral with no ending.
Still you bring me loving,
Free me with a touch
Lead me out to greet the calm descending
When all is said and done,
You are the only one.
Follow on,
For the open road is waiting,
Like the sun,
We will welcome what tomorrow has to bring.
Be it fair or stormy weather,
Take my hand,
And we'll walk the road together,
I won't mind,
If it turns out that we never find the end,
'Cause all I ask is that,
You want me as a friend.
All I ask is that you want me as a friend.
And we'll walk the road together,
I won't mind,
If it turns out that we never find the end,
'Cause all I ask is that,
You want me as a friend.
'Cause all I ask is that,
you want me as a friend.
When all is said and done,
You are the only one.
Follow on.

The one I love is lost without the least bit of explanation
Just goes to show the futility of self-preservation
Now all I seem to see is all this war and goin' amongst our nation
What good will it do?
Now everybody wants to know the secrets to our salvation
Forever reading on and on from Genesis to Revelation
But never stopping for a second to examine the situation
After all that we've been through
And will it only end
When there's nothing left to defend?
Will we ever see, yeah
A common bond of humanity?
I get a landscape of famine and also of frustration
With children walking 'round without the proper means to education
And still up there on Capitol Hill they're passing all of this legislation
For jails and bombs
So anybody out there hear my prayer
Anybody out there hear my prayer
Anybody out there hear my prayer
We need all of you'll back and down here
We need all of you'll back and down here
We need all of you'll back and down here

Chorus
Christmas is almost here (x3)
Aaahhhggggrrr!
It's just five days till Christmas, I haven't done a thing
Don't even have a Christmas tree, I am panicking
Most lots are all sold out, I search until the night
I end up with a grubby shrub with a case of blight
CHORUS
It's four days till Christmas, still have to decorate
Spend hours in the basement until I find the crate
Of lights and bulbs and popcorn strings, tangled in a knot
Then I spend the day separating what I've got
CHORUS
It's three days till Christmas, I spent all day writing cards
I started writing letters now I just say "best regards"
I shove 'em in a mailbox and to the mall I go
To get gifts for Jim and Jane and Tim and Uncle Joe (and aunt Mavis and Grandma and
....)
CHORUS
Two days till Christmas, a million things to do
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due
Where are my in-laws, they should have shown up
I bet they're at the airport I forgot to pick them up
CHORUS (x4)
Christmas is here
It's finally Christmas, the kids wake me up at five
I fall downstairs a messy haired zombie, half-alive
Spend all day serving company, then fall down inert
If these are my holidays I'd rather stay at work

Will ye go tae Flanders, Young Jimmy-o?
Oh will ye go tae Flanders, Young Jimmy-o?
There you'll get wine and brandy
And medals find and dandy,
O will ye go to Flanders, Young Jimmy-o?
Oh dinnae go tae Flanders, Young Jimmy-o!
Dinnae go tae Flanders, my own dear Jimmy-o!
What good tae me is brandy
And medals find and dandy,
If you're lyin' deid on Flanders, My Jimmy-o?
Will ye go tae Flanders, young Jimmy-o?
And serve those who command us, Young Jimmy-o?
We fight the fearful Hun
With our long Lee-Enfield guns
Though he's just your fellow man
When we stop for Christmas day.
Jimmy went to Flanders so many years ago,
To the Somme, to Ypres and Arras, not so many years ago.
He played his pipes to battle
And the laddies died like cattle
And the brandy was drunk in Whitehall
A million miles away.

Autumn leaves are falling 'round us
Time to gather all those many thoughts
Of all the things that might have been
Or gained at such a cost
For some of us there's endless hoping
For some of us craziness too
Holding on to better reasons
Works for me and you, you know it's true
And when the stakes are higher
Never play with fire, leave it alone
I wandered through a country churchyard
And wandered what kind of life they led
Walked into a castle ruin
Of gentry that had fled
For some of them had endless hoping
Some of them crazy too
Holding on to better reasons
We'll never truly know, oh
Those trees will tumble down on a stormy day
And those leaves will fade away, fade away
The autumn leaves are falling 'round us
I'm here to gather all my many thoughts
Of all the things that might have been
As the ground has turned to frost
Leaves are falling
Autumn leaves are falling
Leaves are falling
Autumn leaves are falling

I forget the difference between being in love
And being familiar with something I hope I'm above
Hear a lie enough and it cuts like the gospel
'Cuz when you're half-awake, no mistake is impossible
I'm a child again, lost and happy in make believe
I'm lazy now, so someone's pretending for me
An untouchable man who holds his hand out to millions
Anyone can share his beautiful heroes and ugly villains
I spend a lot of time watching my TV
I take what they give me and I give them nothing
But I waste a lot of time watching my TV
Got me right where they want me, ready for anything
I forget the difference between being loved
And being a loose pocket, worn-wallet, short-sighted
Friend to lift money off of
Maybe I'm playing their game
so I can have a show where I stick 'em like a pig one day
Tell 'em they can go to hell 'cause they don't know another way
Or maybe I'm here 'cause it's something to do
You know still waters can run shallow too
I could watch myself run dry
So I spend a lot of time watching my TV
I take what they give me and I give them nothing
But I waste a lot of time watching my TV
Got me right where they want me, ready for anything
I forget the difference between being alive
And living through somebody else who's acting out somebody else's life

Notes: The song is a lament for a lost love
killed in battle. He will now take the "low road", or the spiritual road, back home to Scotland,
while Moira (his love) stays on the "high road" or the earthbound road.
This concept is based on a Celtic myth that stated
when a Scotsmen died in a foreign land, they took the low road back home.
They will never meet again in this life
but they will
some day meet again
far above the bonnie banks of Loch lomond.
O wither away my bonnie May(which direction) Sae late an' sae far in the gloamin' (so far) (Gloaming = dusk/twilight) The mist gathers grey o'er moorland and brae (hill) O wither sae far are ye roamin'?
Chorus:
O ye'll tak the high road an' I'll tak the low I'll be in Scotland afore ye For me and my true love will never meet again By the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond
I trusted my ain love last night in the broom (own) (bush) My Donald wha' loves me sae dearly For the morrow he will march for Edinburgh toon (town) Tae fecht for his King and Prince Charlie (to fight)
O well may I weep for yestreen in my sleep (yesterday), we stood bride and bridegroom together. But his arms and his breath were as cold as the death And his heart's blood ran red in the heather
(Chorus)
As dauntless in battle as tender in love He'd yield ne'er a foor toe the foeman (enemy) But never again frae the field o' the slain (from) Tae his Moira will he come by Loch Lomond
The thistle may bloom, the King hae his ain (have his own) And fond lovers may meet in the gloamin' And me and my true love will yet meet again Far above the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
(Chorus)

I'll tell you a story and it's a true one and I'll tell it like you understand
And I ain't gonna talk like some history maid.
I look out and I see a land.
Young and lovely. Hard and strong
For fifty thousand years we've danced her praises.
Prayed our thanks and we've just begun. Yes, Yes
Yes this is my country.
Young and growing.
Free and flowing. See to see.
Yes, this is my country.
Ripe and bearing miracles
in ever pond and tree.
Her spirit walks the high country.
She's giving free wild samples.
And setting an example how to give.
Yes this is my country
Retching and turning
She is like a baby learning how to live
i can stand upon a hill at dawn
Look all around me.
Feel her surround me.
Soldier blue
Can't you see her life has just begun
Beating inside us. Telling us she's here to guide us.
Soldier blue, Soldier blue, Soldier blue.
Can't you see that there's another way to love her.
This is my country
And I sprang from her
And I'm learning how to count upon her.
Tall trees and the corn is high country.
I guess I love her.
And I'm learning how to take care of her
When the news stories get me down
I take a drink of freedom to think of
North America from toe to crown
It's never long before
I know just why I belong here
Soldier Blue, Soldier Blue
Can't you see that there's another way to love her

By a lonely prison wall,
I heard a young girl calling
Michael they have taken you away,
For you stole Trevelyan's corn
So the young might see the morn,
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay
CHORUS
Low lie, The Fields of Athenry
where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
we had dreams and songs to sing,
It's so lonely round the Fields of Athenry
By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
'Nothing matters Mary, when you're free'
Against the famine and the crown,
I rebelled, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity
CHORUS
By a lonely harbour wall
She watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
For she lived in hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely round the Fields Of Athenry
CHORUS

When will I see
An end to destruction and woe
And how will I see
No division in my life
There comes a time to make amends
Never too late to try again
To save our soul when will I see an end
To the famine and war
And when will I say
There's no solution no more
There comes a time to make amends
Never too late to try again
To save our soul
All that I see
Is soul destroying, greed
When will I say
There's a solution to meet
There comes a time to make amends
Never too late to try again
To save our soul

The Men of the West
(William Rooney)
When you honor in song and in story
The names of the patriot men,
Whose valor has covered with glory
Full many a mountain and glen,
Forget not the boys of the heather
Who rallied their bravest and best
When Ireland was broken in Wexford
And looked for revenge to the West.
cho: I give you the gallant old West, boys,
Where rallied our bravest and best
When Ireland lay broken and bleeding;
Hurrah for the men of the West!
The hilltops with glory were glowing
'Twas the eve of a bright harvest day,
When the ship we'd been wearily waiting
Sailed into Killala's broad bay.
And over the hills went the slogan
To awaken in every breast
The fire that has never been quenched, boys,
Among the true hearts of the West.
cho:
Killala was ours ere the midnight,
And high over Ballina town
Our banners in triumph were waving
Before the next sun had gone down.
We gathered to speed the good work, boys
The true men from near and afar;
And history can tell how we routed
The redcoats through old Castlebar.
cho:
And pledge me the stout sons of France, boys,
Bold Humbert and all his brave men,
Whose tramp, like the trumpet of battle,
Brought hope to the drooping again.
Since Ireland has caught to her bosom
On many a mountain and hill
The gallants who fell, so they're here, boys,
To cheer us to victory still.
cho:
Though all the bright dreamings we cherished
Went down in disaster and woe,
The spirit of old is still with us
That never would bend to the foe.
And Connaught is ready whenever
The loud rolling tuck of the drum
Rings out to awaken the echoes
And tell us the morning has come.
cho:

===DOCUMENT BOUNDARY===

When first I came to Ireland some pleasure for to find
It's there I spied a damsel fair, 'twas pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks and sparklin' eyes like arrows pierced my breast
And I call her lovely Molly O', the lily of the west
One day as I was walkin' down by a shady grove
I spied a lord of high degree conversing with my love
She sang her song delightfully while I was sore oppressed
Saying I've been a dupe [I bid adieu?] to Molly O', the lily of the west
Well, I stepped up with my rapier and my dagger in my hand
And I dragged him from my false love and boldly I bid him stand
But being mad with desperation I swore I'd pierce his breast
I was then deceived by Molly O', the lily of the west
A flaw was in my indictment found and that soon had me free
That beauty bright I did adore, the judge did her address
Now go, you faithless Molly O', the lily of the west
Now that I've gained my liberty a-rowin' I will go
I ramble through old Ireland and travel Scotland o'er
Though she thought to swear my life away she still disturbs my rest,
I still must style her, Molly O', the lily of the west.

Farewell to Princes' landing stage River Mersey fare thee well
I am bound for California, a place I know right well
So fare thee well my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee
I have sailed with Burgess once before, I think I know him well
If a man's a sailor he will get along, if not then he's sure in hell
So fare thee well my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee
Farewell to Lower Frederick Street, Anson Terrace and Park Lane
I am bound away for to leave you and I'll never see you again
So fare thee well my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee
I am bound for California by way of stormy Cape Horn
And I will write to thee a letter, love, when I am homeward bound
So fare thee well my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
But my darling when I think of thee

Keep the weatherman sweet,
Then begin sweeping the driveway.
News is that the heat's
Coming in, Thursday or Friday.
Now I'm a little slow to see
How weatherman's words are gonna satisfy me
Words can change my point of view
Only if they prove to be true
Seven inches of rain,
I believe it's gonna get wetter
Seven days of the week.
Hopes are high it's gonna get better
Now, I'm not in the hoping game
That's a kind of a pity and a bit of a shame
But hope can be a two-edged sword
And a luxury that I just can't afford
Twelve days, snow would spread the cold around
Twelve days heat would melt the snow on the ground
Twelve days sun is what I'm looking for now
Twelve days grey what's in store.
Keep the weatherman sweet
Then go off, buy an umbrella
Go and wait for the sun
Go and dream beautiful weather
I'm much too old for dreams
Now that's a little bit sad,
But not as sad as it seems
When dreams have been a thorny crown
It's not so sad when they're tumblin' down

There's a rumor spreading all around
We're on the way
To a change of setting, homeward bound
Autumn day
Chorus:
'Cause indoor we will light the fire
Light the fires of hope
Lost between the mountain and the sun
Caught the high emotion by the setting sun
So let's leave early, don't be late
Don't delay
Though we expect you here at eight
Come what may
(Chorus)
Lost between the mountain and the sun
Caught the high emotion by the setting sun
With song and dance we greet the dawn
Another day
The parting mass will soon be gone
We're on our way
(Chorus)
Lost between the mountain and the sun
Caught the high emotion by the setting sun

Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like, when you're older, must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him,
Take your time, it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

As the moon ascends
The wolves come out to see the end
They hide from view and wait
To watch the ghost inside you come awake
And when the shots go off, you hear them call
My heart is racing just to see it all
To watch you crawl out of your changing shape
Take all your breath and watch it come awake
From the flames of the fire,
I feel you crawling to my bed
Throwing shapes at the sky,
I watch you crying to me
With your knees open
I display you, taunt the beast again
'cause when you move and shake
That thing inside you comes awake
As you dance against the breathing wall
My claws are out, I want to feel it all
Feel it crawl inside you, changing shape
Take out your breath and feel you come awake
From the flames of the fire,
I feel you crawling to my bed
Throwing shapes at the sky,
I watch you crying to me
Say something, pray for something
Say something, pray to something
Say something, pray to something
Say something, pray to something
Say
(from the flames of the fire
I watch you crawling to me)
From the flames of the fire,
I feel you crawling to my bed
Throwing shapes at the sky,
I watch you crying to me
Say something! pray for something!
Say something! pray to something!
Say

CAYO HUESO
Words and Music Chris Foster
January 29, 2003
The dreamland of the world is on an island
The Indians were the first to stake their claim
The Spaniards came along And found a lot of bones
And discovered it already had a name
They called it Cayo Hueso They came to Cayo Hueso
It was Cayo Hueso It was the king of Spain's
It was Cayo Hueso When they first reached Cayo Hueso
It was Cayo Hueso Because Skeleton's remained.
Wreckers were a rich part of its history
Running after ships that were going down
The first to get there claimed the loot.
Totally legal and all To Boot!
Then they'd bring the goods to auction in the town.
Down in Cayo hueso coral reef off Cayo Hueso
Down in Cayo Hueso Ships in storms were often doomed
Down in Cayo Hueso legal pirates Cayo Hueso
Down in Cayo Hueso the wrecking business boomed
Instrumental:
90 miles north of Havana exist another world
the locals march to the beat of their own drum
this little piece of paradise has everything you need
you'll never want to leave it when you come.
The locals call themselves the conch republic
For they seceded from the union where others tried and failed
Dennis Wardlow took some bread and Broke it on a sailors head
Then surrendered to the Admiral. What a story that is to tell.
Only in Cayo Hueso Conch republic Cayo Hueso
Come on to Cayo Hueso. Through a road block asinine.
All in Cayo Hueso, South of Homestead Cayo Hueso
Come to Cayo Hueso, Skeeters last chance was the line
Down in Cayo Hueso historic cayo hueso
Down in Cayo Hueso is where I want to stay
The town of Cayo Hueso I just love Cayo Hueso
I go to Cayo Hueso to chase my blues away!

Just for a moment, the moment I met her
I lost my breath but my lips whispered, she is the one
Forgot who I was and who I was fooling
Didnt remember she could be my first cue to run
We moved so fast
Never thought twice
Mind came at last
Put us on ice
We stayed in touch but the touch I was wanting from her
Came from girls that scared me too little to love
So all of the thoughts I thought I might tell her
Turned into songs that until now shes never heard of
I had been taught
Love is a vice
Took all these thoughts
And I put them on ice
The vice bends and ice tends to melt
One night she asked me how I felt
The next day I woke up lying to myself
I feel fine, I feel fine, I feel fine
Thank God, youre here, I need you to hear this
So sick of my shit, I promise, Im through tempting fate
I know Im in love now, you are what love is to me
Please tell me this isnt too little too late
Oh, lets move fast
Making up would be nice
Im so sorry, I put these things on ice
I would like to help you dance right

A child will walk, a child will run
A child with faith, faith will fly
Anita hasn't walked right since she was small
Her legs are short and twisted not straight and tall
She learned when she was young how to deal with the rejection
Cast into a world with all it standards of perfection
Most people looked away with a downward glance
And as a beautiful young woman, she was never asked to dance
Her dreams were just as lofty as the girl next door
And she remember what her father said when she couldn't take no more
He said
Someday your going to soar like a eagle,
You will run and never grow tired
You'll become a new creation
If you just keep the faith of a child,
Keep the faith of a child
Now Anita lives alone in a paper mill town
In a one room apartment at sixth and brown
She's got a steady job well its all right for now
She has plans for moving on if she can make it some how
Her brown hands are folded as she bows her head to pray
Over doughnuts and some coffee she made up yesterday
Her mind begins to travel, she gives thanks to the lord
And a angel stands beside her, points out to the door
And said
Today you going to soar like a eagle
You will run and never grow tired
You've become a new creation
For you have kept the faith of a child
Kept the faith of a child, kept the faith of a child

Black dust in orbit
Cascades down like a parachute
Bricks on my shoulders
This gravity hurts when you know the truth
I'm pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
We dreamt like martyrs
I never thought I was bold enough
You pushed me further
And I take the blame for the both of us
I'm pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Oh, Universe, hold me up
Tried your best, is it ever enough
When it's already dragging me down?
I'm pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can't lift this on my own

Through the mist my ship has sailed, leaving me behind
All things left unsaid, that were in my mind
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw
Strange they have vanished now
I'm standing on the shore
Sandy hills all around, nothing standing clear
Softly light is falling through, time was never here
When I stood on this deck, stranges things I saw
STRANGE THEY HAVE VANISHED NOW
I'm standing on the shore
Headlands fading out of sight, horizons disappear
Hazy shores and silent seas, nothing DO I fear
Air and water, grass and sand, merging into one
In the silence of the mist, I am still alone
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw
Strange they have vanished now
I'm standing on the shore
Standing on the shore

Yes it`s ok
No I don`t mind
But take it slow `cause I take
Time to unwind
And if you`re nervous that`s ok, hey,
So am I, so am I, so am I
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
And put your lips to mine again
Put your lips to mine again
No I don`t mind
And to be precise
If you did well, it would
Be kind of nice
So let that sparkle overflow,oh,
Don`t be shy, don`t be shy, don`t be shy
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
And put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
No I don`t mind
And I`d like to say
I love the fact that first you
Asked anyway
So slide on over here to me,
Make me smile, make me smile, make me smile
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put your lips to mine again
Yes it`s ok
Really it`s fine
Gentle shivers running down my spine
Have me feeling to my toes,
Satisfied, satisfied, satisfied
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again

Go my way and I'll be good to you
Go my way and your dreams will all come true
In the sunset the wild waves are callin'
My shadow is followin' you
Go my way and I'll take you by the hand
Believe in me and I'll do the best I can
I can't be anything but just what I am
I can't help it if I'm in love with you
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again
Go my way it's the only way to go
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know
Come on along and together well go
Please love me and say that you'll be mine
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again
Go my way it's the only way to go
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know
Come on along and together well go
Please love me and say that you'll be mine

It if wasn't for the ships that do sail, that do sail,
It if wasn't for the ships that do sail,
Dublin Lady wouldn't have to sit alone upon her stool,
It if wasn't for the ships that do sail.
If it wasn't for the butter tubs and coal all in the hold,
Dublin Lady wouldn't have to spend her nights alone and cold,
If it wasn't for the kegs of beer and cattle in the pen,
Dublin Lady wouldn't miss her sailor laddie now and then,
If it wasn't for the Irish Sea so narrow with no reef,
Dublin Lady wouldn't have to sit and weep all in her grief,

I see your true colours shining through
I see your true colours that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours, true colours shining through
You with the sad eyes, don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize it's hard to take courage
In a world full of people, you can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you makes you feel so small
But I see your true colours shining through
I see your true colours and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours, true colours are beautiful
Like a rainbow
So sad eyes take courage now and realize
When this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colours shining through
I see your colours and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours, true colours are beautiful
Oh, like a rainbow
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Your true colours are beautiful
Like a rainbow

I'm on my way, got no time to waste
Places to go, people to chase
Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste
Gotta get away from here
Twenty-one years from the day I was born
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm
You come to me
You were the girls with the summer sunshine
In your eyes and in your smile
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here
I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram
You can stick my money in an old tin can
I think I fell in love again
I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine
I was almost gone, I was over the line
I said what's come over me
You were the girl with the sound of springtime
In your songs and in your voice
You were the one I thought, loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you
I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze
Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away

I play and sing
Dawn
When they ask me for my autograph
I catch you in the corner of my eye
And I know that smile upon your face
Means we made it girl, you and I
From the hard life on the south side
To the spotlight here on the stage
[Chorus:]
Now watch me play
Hear me sing la-la-la la-la-la-la
I play and sing for you la-la-la-la
Hear the applause
Without you, no telling where I'd be
Singing me a different song
Breaking rocks for ten or twenty years
But you wouldn't let me go wrong
Standing by me 'cause you love me
Now darling, this one's for you
[Chorus x3]
Now watch me play
Hear me sing la-la-la la-la-la-la

Sit awhile staring at the ocean
Riding high the boats flying motion
Just a smile, tears and emotion
Storm rise on the northern skyline
Shadows are haunting me drifting down to the sea
Remember when we used sing the old songs
Of friends that part to sail to a new land
Without a smile, so long a journey
Storm rise on the northern skyline
Shadows are haunting me drifting down to the sea
Rest awhile staring at the mountain
Reaching high, the valley's far below us
See for miles, the clear horizon
Storm rise on the northern skyline
Shadows are haunting me drifting down to the sea

Fare you well, my own true love
Farewell for a while
I am going away but I'll be back
If I go ten thousand miles
Ten thousand miles, my own true love
Ten thousand miles or more
And the rocks may melt and the seas may burn
If I no more return
Oh don't you see yon lonesome dove
Sitting on yon ivy tree
She is weeping for her own true love
As I shall weep for mine
Oh come back, my own true love
And stay a while with me
If I had a friend all on this earth
You have been a friend to me

One evening fair I took the air
Down by Blackwaterside
'Twas gazing all around me
When the Irish lad I spied
All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play,
When this young man arose and he gathered his clothes,
Saying, "Fare thee well today".
That's not the promise that you gave to me
When the first you lay on my breast,
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west.
Go home, go home, to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill,
And think upon your own misfortune
Which you bought with your wanton will.

After the morning there comes an evening
And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say
I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung
As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree
"What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree"
He looked around and he saw her coming
And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind
Come down, come down from that cruel gallows
I've got your pardon from the king
And I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green

It ain't no jive
I was burnin' alive
Whenever you walked in the room
It happened so quickly
I was feelin' so sickly
Like a lover who lost his muse
The sharks in the tank
The man in the bank
He wants my money to loan
I can't understand
What the hell is his plan?
I ain't even got a home
Ain't got a home
The girl on the street
With holes in her feet
Looks through eyes of a clown
She don't look mad
Just feelin' kinda sad
So I just walk around
I reassess, she's down on her luck
She's reading a book of lies
I don't know when I'll be comin' home, baby
But I sure can sympathize
Can sympathize
Angels spread their wings
On all the dirty things
You do
She drops to the floor
Her head's by the door
Her bible is by her side
Heaven is callin'
The new world is fallin'
And she ain't got a single person left
To confide
No one to confide
I sympathize
Can sympathize

Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,
If you feel inclined
Down around the bend in the water,
Bring your fishin' line
Come on Pearl, I'm rough and ready,
Got my fishin' pole
Down around the bend in the water
To the fishin' hole
It's a fine July on a beautiful night
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay
Down around the bend in the water,
If you feel inclined
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,
I'm gonna make you mine
All around the world tonight
What a beautiful scene below
Too fine a time to stand in line
I'm gonna take my love to go
It's a fine July and a beautiful way
For a boy and a girl to pass the time of day
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,
If you feel inclined
Down around the bend in the water,
Bring your fishin' line
All around the world tonight
What a beautiful sight below
Too fine a time to stand in line
I'm gonna take my love to go
It's a fine July on a beautiful light
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay
Down around the bend in the water,
If you feel inclined
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,
Bring your fishin' line
Come on Pearl, I'm rough and ready,
Got my fishin' pole
Down around the bend in the water
To the fishin' hole

if you were a melody I'm quite sure you would be in a movie
where the characters look lovely and the plot is about romance
you would sound right there in the climax scene
where all the problems of those characters seem to disappear
we share our secrets no more
and I haven't heard about sad sad stories
about the past, or happy moments of today
oh... I wonder what are you doing now
oh... what am I gonna do?
if you were a melody I'm quite sure you would be in a movie
where the characters look lovely and the plot is about romance
you would sound right there in the climax scene
where all the problems of those characters seem to disappear
oh... I wonder what are you doing now
oh... you wonder what I am doing now
oh... I wonder what I am doing now
oh... what am I gonna do?

You can point and laugh
I'm sure he's used to that
Using faith like an acrobat 'til the net breaks
He won't get upset
That though we've never met
I know, everything he's said 'cause a friend once told me
He's got hell fire in his eyes
There is madness behind the lies
He would burn us all alive just to prove his point
God save the believer
We mistake for a deceiver
'Cause it makes us feel better
The time has come and gone
To say what's right and wrong
People like him don't belong 'cause we're all okay
You'd better write him off
Without a second thought
'Cause thinking just leads to getting caught in the traps he sets, like
Who is that on his knees?
It's that daring young man from the flying trapeze
Crying "father, father, help me please" well good luck, pal
'Cause you're gonna need it
God save the believer
We mistake for a deceiver
'Cause it makes us feel better
He's got hell fire in his eyes
There is madness behind the lies
He would burn us all alive just to prove his point
God save the believer
We mistake for a deceiver
'Cause it makes us feel better

Give me some Love Insurance
I need the million dollar plan
That way the day you leave me
I'll be able to make a friend
Sure I'll be broken hearted
And I'll have you to thank
But I'll only be lonely
Walkin' to and from the bank
Give me some Love Insurance
I need, I need, I need...
The million dollar plan
I knew the day I met you
I'd be your biggest fan
But your eyes spelled out "DANGER"
(double-you-oh) M.A.N.!
But I thought maybe I'd be lucky
Maybe you'd take my hand
And touch these lips of roses
Delivering the promised land
Give me some Love Insurance.
I need the million dollar plan
You're my coffee in the morning
The honey in my tea
The most delicious kisses
Baby you're exhaustin' me
But I am fearful for
That you'll want less and I''ll want more
So just to even the score...

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I won't keep watching you
Dance around in your smoke
And flicker out
You're not the light I used to know
I don't believe in safety nets
Strung below that make it alright
To let go
You gotta hold on
Or it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You don't have enough rain
To make up your storm?
Oooh whatcha look so sad for?
Where's the light I used to know?
Oh it's gonna

Hello
It's good to see you coming back again
It's been a long time
Since I sat with you, my friend
I'll lend an ear
It's not that so severe
Time has killed the pain
And dried up every tear
And now
I'm thinking 'bout what went down
All the heartache I laughed away
Just like a clown
And now sit around talking
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
To spend some time
You sit around talking
Thinking 'bout the past
It's funny how it lingers
But nothings meant to last
And my ma
She'd like to say hello
But she's a little scared
That I can't let it go
So let on, ease back, brother
And let it slip away
I'm tired of hanging onto
The pains of yesterday
And once again
The money is so thick
It makes your heart go numb
It makes your mind get sick
So come on by, stay and talk about it
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
Brother of mine
We'll sit around talking, drink some wine
And maybe by the morning
Everything is fine, everything is fine
Ease back, brother
Let this clear your mind
Come on by
And drink yourself a good time
Have some wine
And think about each other
Sister, am I fine?
Yes, I've been alright now
Take it lightly
Step on out the front door
I'll see you once some time

O see the fleet-foot host of men,
Who march with faces drawn,
From farmstead and from fishers' cot,
Along the banks of Ban;
They come with vengeance in their eyes.
Too late! Too late are they,
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today.
Up the narrow street he stepped,
So smiling, proud and young.
About the hemp-rope on his neck,
The golden ringlets clung;
There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes,
Fearless and brave are they,
As young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today.
When last this narrow street he trod,
His shining pike in hand
Behind him marched, in grim array,
A earnest stalwart band.
To Antrim town! To Antrim town,
He led them to the fray,
But young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today.
There's never a one of all your dead
More bravely died in fray
Than he who marches to his fate
In Toomebridge town today; ray
True to the last! True to the last,
He treads the upwards way,
And young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today.

I danced in the morning
When the world was begun,
And I danced in the moon
And the stars and the sun,
And I came down from heaven
And I danced on the earth,
At Bethlehem
I had my birth.
Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he
I danced for the scribe
And the pharisee,
But they would not dance
And they wouldn't follow me.
I danced for the fishermen,
For James and John
They came with me
And the Dance went on.
Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he
I danced on the Sabbath
And I cured the lame;
The holy people
Said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped
And they hung me on high,
And they left me there
On a Cross to die.
Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he
I danced on a Friday
When the sky turned black
It's hard to dance
With the devil on your back.
They buried my body
And they thought I'd gone,
But I am the Dance,
And I still go on.
Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he
They cut me down
And I leapt up high;
I am the life
That'll never, never die;
I'll live in you
If you'll live in me -
I am the Lord
Of the Dance, said he.

An act of God has struck us
An act of faith sustains us
But it seems hopeless
And I feel helpless to you
An act of man has hit us
Worse than any god
And I can't shield you
And I can't shelter you,but
If you're in need of comfort
I will do what I can
If I can't feed your body
I'll soothe it with my hands
If I can't ease your hunger
I'll give you all I have
To nourish and love
To nourish and love
To nourish and love
The country drenched in fever
The"princess alice" leaves her
But I can't send you
And I can't hope to save you
The hunger on this island's
Spread to every door
And I can't shield you
And I can't shelter you,but

As I came down through Dublin City
At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Washing her feet by the candlelight
First she washed them, then she dried them
Over a fire of amber coals
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so sweet about the soul
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
As I came back through Dublin City
At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she brushed it, then she tossed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
As I returned to Dublin City
As the sun began to set
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Catching a moth, in a golden net
First she saw me, then she fled me
Lifted her petticoats o'er her knee
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair as the Spanish lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
I've wandered north and I have wonder south
Through Stoney Barter and Patrick's close
Up and around, by the Gloucester Diamond
And back by Napper Tandys' house
Auld age has laid her hands on me
Cold as a fire of ashy coals
But there is the love of me Spanish lady
A maid so sweet about the soul
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

I remember the night that he came in from the wintery
Cold and damp
A giant of a man in an oilskin coat, and a bundle that
Told he was a tramp
He stood at the bar and he called a pint, then turned
And gazed at the fire
On a night like this, to be save and dry is my one and
Only desire
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here"
Then in a voice that was hushed and low he said
"Listen, I'll tell you a tale"
How a man of the sea became a man of the road and never
More will set sail
I fished out of Howth and Killybegs, Ardglass and
Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on
The shore
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here"
One fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail
From Killybegs town
There were five of us from sweet Donegal and one from
County Down
We were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted
The cost
But I never thought 'ere that night was done, that my
Fine friends would all be lost
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here"
Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown
But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here"
Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here"
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here"

Locking doors, spotless pores
Finding comfort in a total bore
The number four, genealogical lore
Nothing feels good unless I've felt it before
The neighbor's gay, he shouldn't be that way
I'm gonna treat him like a person but not today
When I'm old and grey, and he's dying of AIDS
I'm gonna stop by his bed to remind him to pray
Melvin is locking doors
He makes everything a chore
And he don't really care no more
Melvin is locking doors
Nervous when my little woman friend
Makes me kinda wanna be a man again
Don't wanna bend, better to offend
But I'll get pissed when she looks at other men
Melvin is locking doors
And he makes everything a chore
And he don't really care
Locking doors, salting sores
When one wimp winces we'll win this war
Show me some gore, man, I'm so hardcore
But it doesn't feel good unless I've felt it
Nothing feels good unless I've felt it before
Melvin is locking doors

Blue mountain river, if only for a while
Take me to the river, lay down by your side
The world is full of madness and I find it hard to smile
Take me where you're going and I'll be right by your side
Blue mountain river, comfort me a while
I'll follow down the river, follow you till night
I hasten to your whispers, you dance in time to mine
We'll stay awake together watching the silver in the sky
Blue mountain river, I want to rest a while
You're changing my reflection and the seasons in my mind
Let these days go on forever, I'll leave in my own time
Take me where you're going and I'll be right by your side
Blue mountain river, I went there for a while
I listened for an answer and I found it deep inside
When I'm lost behind the shadows and I want to run and hide
My blue mountain river is there right by my side

It was Christmas Eve, babe, in the drunk tank
An old man said, "Son, I won't see another one"
And then he sang a song, a rare old mountain tune
I turned my eyes away, and I thought about you
I got on a lucky one, came in at 18/1
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas, I love you baby
There's going to be good times
When all our dreams come true.
They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind blows right through you
It's no place for the old
When I first took your hand on a cold Christmas Eve
I told you that Broadway was waiting for me.
You were handsome and pretty, queen of New York city
When the band finished playing, the crowd howled for more
Sinatra was swinging, and the crowd they were singing
We kissed on the corner and danced round the floor.
CHORUS
And the boys from the New York police choir were singin' Galway Bay
And the bells were ringin' out on Christmas Day
I could have been someone and so could anyone
I took my dreams from you when I first met you
I kept them with me, babe, and put them with my own
I can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you.
You're a bum you're a punk you're an aul hoor on junk
Lyin' there on the drip nearly dead in the bed
You scumbag you maggot you cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas me arse, I would rather be dead...
CHORUS
I love you baby
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas, I love you baby
There's going to be good times
When all our dreams come true.

It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the home town a million miles away
Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same
And by the way, did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games
And by the way, did she mention my name
Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way, did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain
And by the way, did she mention my name

Swam accross that muddy river
The moon was shining down
The tide was swift and the water deep
But I did not drown
I touched the land of milk and honey
And what I found
A bullet with your name on it
Still has the same sound
And I'm still on the run
Yeah I'm still on the run
I'm still under the gun
Yeah I'm still on the run
I felt the heat of the searchlights
But they were one step behind
Most men would have froze with fear
But it never crossed my mind
I got a woman, she a waitin
She put her heart on the line
Theres nothing here can hold me back
Cause love ain't no crime
And I'm still on the run
And I'm still on the run
I'm still under the gun
And I'm still on the run
Swam accross that muddy river
The moon was shining down
The tide was swift and the water deep
But I did not drown
I touched the land of milk and honey
And what I found
A bullet with your name on it
It still has the same sound
And I'm still on the run
And I'm still on the run
I'm still under the gun
And I'm still on the run
Well I'm still on the run
Don't you know I'm still running
Still on the run...

About 6 months ago, someone came by with a petition
Said we'd wanna stop these folks moving in next door
I refused to sign and told him everyone was welcome
'Cause that's what neighbourhoods are for
So they moved in and I'll admit they look peculiar
They invited me to a friendly barbeque
Glad I got to know 'em, and let me tell you something
They may be metallic, but they're just like me and you
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
They gave me zucchini from their garden yesterday (they're very fresh)
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!
My buddy Charlie never got off the robots' backs
Then one day, him and his whole house disappeared
I talked about it to my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus
They couldn't help me, but agreed that it was wierd...
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
They always mow their lawn, and they joined the PTA (because we care)
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!
They had us over for an outdoor New Year's party
Though it was 10 below, there was food and drink a-plenty
They got excited as we counted down with them
And when we kissed them, our lips stuck to their heads (ouch)
I was watching the news last night, when I saw something funny
Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal
I wondered, could it be my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus?
Could it be them after all?
No. They're so nice! Yeah.
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
They applauded for my kid at the Christmas play (he was the best
shepard)
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK! (We're OK!)

Tis of a brave young highwayman this story I will tell
His name was Willie Brennan and in Ireland he did dwell
It was on the Kilwood Mountain he commenced his wild career
And many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear
It was Brennan on the moor, Brennan on the moor
Bold, brave and undaunted was young Brennan on the moor
One day upon the highway as young Willie he went down
He met the mayor of Cashiell a mile outside of town
The mayor he knew his features and he said, Young man, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town provisions for to buy
And when she saw her Willie she commenced to weep and cry
Said, Hand to me that tenpenny, as soon as Willie spoke
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak
Now with this loaded blunderbuss - the truth I will unfold -
He made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair
Now Brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said
By a false-hearted woman he was cruelly betrayed
They hanged Brennan at the crossroads, in chains he hung and dried
But still they say that, in the night, some do see him ride
They see him with his blunderbuss, all in the midnight chill
Along, along the King's highway rides Willie Brennan still!

A hungry feeling
Came o'er me stealing
All the mice were squealing
In my prison cell
And the auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
To begin the morning
The screw was bawling
"Get up ya bowsie!
And Clean up your cell!"
And the auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
On a fine Spring evening
The loike lay dreaming
And the sea-gulls squeeling
High above the wall
Oh! the day was dying
And the wind was sighing
As I lay there crying
In my prison cell
And the auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
Oh! the screw was peeping
And the loike was sleeping
As he lay there weeping
For his poor gal
And the auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
Up in the female prison
There are seventy five women
And among them,
I wish I did dwell
And the auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

There won't be any presents this Christmas
No goodies in your stocking
The milk and cookies that the children left out
Will be left untouched beside the sink
The reindeer will be staying in their pens this year
The elves haven't built any thing
'Cause Santa got arrested
Last Christmas Day
Police got calls on 911
About a red-suited man who weighed a ton
There was a clear trail of evidence pointing north
This was the seventh time it happened on December 24th
The Mounties reached the North Pole
They found it was outside their jurisdiction
They called up Interpol, the Finnish police
To facilitate the suspect's extradition
They knocked on the door of a well-marked shop
With a warrant for the owner's apprehension
Then Santa got arrested
Christmas Day
Santa was charged with B&E;
His council advised he plead guilty
There was footage of the crime running on TV
And photographs of little children sitting on his knee

(Save me from my own hand)
Ooooooh, set the controls for the heart of the pelvis
Haven't you heard my name rhymes with Elvis
And one thing I know is this
That your mouth is telling me to give you a big kiss
(Now my guard's down)
(Save me from my own hand)
Ahhh, can't you see what's on offer
Yeah babe it's going cheap today
I enter a room and all the girls say
C'mon Jarv, can I be the first?
Oh you make us so hot we feel we're gonna burst
(Now my guard's down)
So please, so please
Don't leave me alone in this double bed
It smells of damp towels and asthma inhalers
Say you're gonna call back later
Save me from these glossy photographs
Save me from my mother's laugh
Save
(Now my guard's down)
That's right girls
That's right girls
Save me from my own hand

Hey, I got a girl at the head of the creek
Goin up to see her about 2 times a week
Kiss her on the mouth, sweet as any wine
Wrap herself around me like a sweet potato vine
Goin up Cripple Creek, goin on a run
Goin up Cripple Creek to have a little fun
Goin up Cripple Creek, goin in a whirl
Goin up Cripple Creek to see my little girl
Now the girls up Cripple Creek about half-grown
Jump on a boy like a dog on a bone
Roll my britches up to my knees
Wade ol Cripple Creek whenever I please
Goin up Cripple Creek, goin on a run
Goin up Cripple Creek to have a little fun
Goin up Cripple Creek, goin in a whirl
Goin up Cripple Creek to see my little girl
Now, Cripple Creek's wide and Cripple Creek's deep
Wade old Cripple Creek before I sleep
Hills are steep and the roads are muddy
and I'm so dizzy that I can't stand steady I'm
Goin up Cripple Creek, goin on a run
Goin up Cripple Creek to have a little fun
Goin up Cripple Creek, goin in a whirl
Goin up Cripple Creek to see my little girl.

Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

The best things in life are not free
But you don't need to have money
To get the things that you want to own
You just have to get a loan
When you buy, small or large
Just put it on your credit card
You can live like a king
Not paying for a single thing
Put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Every night, I pray and thank
God above for creating the banks
They have been so kind to me
With their boundless generosity
If you cannot make your payments
Well, do like the national governments
You can pay off what you owe
By taking out a bigger loan
Ya gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Now I seem to have men after me
From the collection agency
And the bank came by the other day
Took everything I own away
Now I think that it is plain to see
That I must declare bankruptcy
But things aren't really all that bad
I can borrow from my dad!
And put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Ya gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store

Fine girl you are!
Adieu to you my Dinah a thousand times adieu
We`re going away from the Holy Ground and the girls that we love true
We will sail the South sea over and then return for sure
To see again the girls we love and the Holy Ground once more
Chorus:
Fine girl you are! Your`re the girl that I adore
and still I live in hopes to see The Holy Ground once more. Fine girls you are!
See the storm a-rising I see it coming soon,
And the sky it is so cloudy you can scarcely see the moon.
And the good old ship, she was tossing about,
The riggin`was all tore, and still I live with hopes to see, The Holy ground once more.
And now the storm it is over and we are safe on shore,
We will drink a toast to the Holy Ground and the girls that we adore.
We will drink strong ale and porter and make the rafters roar,
And when our money is all spent we`ll go to sea for more.

CHORUS:
Stop setting me up, you keep knocking me down
I'm picking myself back off of the ground
Mad at myself 'cuz I keep hanging around
You got this hold on me (hold on me)
Verse 1:
She brought me to life with the love and the care that she had
And showed me the way we were supposed to be
This love wa s fairy tale 'til evertyhing here got hold of me
Started molding me and folding me, I'll never be the shape you need
Stop chasing me and making me be something I'm not made to be
'Cuz I cant be that, I don't got puppet strings
If I was man enough I'd get my ass right up and leave
But I think I'm stuck to you, its a sick disease
And baby girl..you keep infecting me
Verse 2:

In the Beartooth Mountains where the twin peaks touch the sky
There's a homemade cabin out of sight from tourists' eyes
And inside lightin' up a fire to fight the cold
Lives a miner's daughter with a heart as pure as gold
She's as gentle flowin' as the sweet grass on the plains
And I need her lovin' like the forest needs the rain
Like a rollin' river she just swept my heart away
Now I'm out here driftin' when I know I should've stayed
Oh, that west wind is callin' in skies of turqoise blue
And the creek is still runnin' like quicksilver dew
She was all that I needed, why did I ever leave?
Oh, her voice voice on the westwind is still callin' me
There's a cold wind blowin' through this mountain pass tonight
As I hold her memory to my heart it don't seem right
Just an empty cabin with a lock left on the door
Now I realize that I've lost the girl for sure
So I went up to Red Lodge to see if they might know
All the townfolk said that she left sometime ago
She just up and married with a nice young city man
I was a fool to let her slip right through my hands

If the sea was whiskey and I was a diving duck
If the sea was whiskey and I was a diving duck
I'd swim to the bottom and I don't know if I'd come up
I'm just here wondering will a matchbox hold my clohtes
I'm just here wondering will a matchbox hold my clohtes
If things don't get no better then down the road I go
Whiskey and beers they don't make me drunk
Whiskey and beers they don't make me druink
These blues are gonna make me pack my trunk

Oh, the heart beats in its cage
Well I don't feel better when I'm fucking around
And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson 'cause I've already learned
Yes, the sun will be shining and my children will burn
Oh, the heart beats in its cage
I don't want what you want and I don't feel what you feel
You see I'm stuck in the city but I belong in a field
Oh, we gotta laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating along
Oh, the heart beats in its cage
All your friends are laughing at us
All the ones you loved you mistrust
Help me now I'm not quite myself
Look around there's no one else left
Well I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
O,h I gotta laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
And I'm sorry you were thinking that I would steal your fire
Oh, the heart beats in its cage
Oh, the heart beats in its cage

Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin'
Can hear my guitar rocking?
While I stroll on down
On down the highway
People think, I'm a crazing
The Lord above ain't lazing
The sunshine's all day long
[Incomprehensible] far too strong
While I stroll on down
On down the highway
While I stroll on down
On down the highway
The cars won't stop for no one
They don't think that you're just rolling down
They think you're an OAS spy
Gonna shoot them as they go by
No cars, they won't stop
Won't stop for no one
Strolling down the highway
And I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin'
Can hear my guitar rocking?
While I stroll on down
On down the highway

The US is the eagle, Russia is the bear,
Australia is the kangaroo, cause they're kind of weird down there.
Yeah, India is the tiger, that stands so proud and tall,
But Canada is the greatest of them all.
We are the beaver, we're furry and we're free
Yeah, we are the beaver, we got two big front teeth
Yeah, we are the beaver, we can chew right through small trees
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.
You might think a rodent is a pretty lame choice
For a national animal, but don't you listen to that voice.
No, cause all them birds and preditors, just take from the land
But the beaver, always gives a dam.
We are the beaver, we got cute little webbed feet
Yeah, we are the beaver, it's bark we like to eat
Yeah, we are the beaver, a nickel we complete.
Yeah, we are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.
The eagle flies the sky above and swoops down on its prey
The big bear will maul anyone who dares gets in its way
The tiger is the greatest of the hunters today.
But the beaver it can build dams. Yeah,
The beaver it can build dams, dams, dams.
We are the beaver, we slap our tails when danger's nearby
We are the beaver, we got waterproof hides
Yeah, we are the beaver, we got big bums and beady eyes.
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.
We are the beaver, our name is often used as a double entedre
We are the beaver, cause in Canada, both French and English belong
Yeah, we are the beaver, and the subject of this song is
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.
I can't hear you.
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver
Are you getting the point?
We are the beaver, we are the beaver.
We are the beaver

It was down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I
There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew
Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew
'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew
The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew

Oh if you've got a wingo, take her up to Ringo
Where the waxies sing-o all the day.
If you've had your fill of porter and you can't go any
Further
Just give your men the order, "Back to the quay"
And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto langeroo! To you
Well you've heard of Butcher Foster, the dirty old
Imposter
He took his mot and lost her up in Furry Glen
He first put on his bowler, then he buttoned up his
Trousers
And he whistled for a growler and he said "My men"
And take me up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take me up to Monto langeroo! To you
Well you've heard of the Dublin Fusiliers, the dirty
Old bamboozaliers
They went and got the childer, one, two, three
Marchin' from the Linen Hall, there's one for every
Cannon ball
And Vicky's goin' to send youse all o'er the sea
But First go up to Monto, Monto, Monto
First go up to Monto langeroo! To you
Well Carry told him, "Skin the goat"; O'Donnell put him
On the boat
He never should have been afloat, the dirty skite
It wasn't very sensible to tell on the Invincibles
They stood up for the principals, day and night
They're goin' up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Goin' up to Monto langeroo! To you
Now the czar of Russia, and the king of Prussia
Landed in the Phoenix in a big balloon
They asked the Police band to play the "The wearin' o'
The Green"
But the buggers in the depot didn't know the tune
So they all went up to Monto, Monto, Monto
They all went up to Monto langeroo! To you
The Queen she came to call on us, she wanted to see all
Of us,
I'm glad she didn't fall on us, she's eighteen stone
Well "Mr. Neill, Lord Mayor", says she, "Is this all
You've got to show to me?"
"why no ma'am, there's some more to see ? p?g mo thoin
And he took her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
He took her up to Monto, langeroo! To you
Well if you've got a wingo, take her up to Ringo
Where the waxies sing-o all the day.
If you've had your fill of porter and you can't go any
Further
Just give your men the order, "Back to the quay"
And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto langeroo! To you

One hour ahead of the posse
the bloodhounds are hot on my trail
last night I shot my sweetheart
this morning I broke out of jail
my Pinto is tired and hungry
and I'm feeling weary and warm
we started ahead of the posse
and we got to keep going on
the sherrif aswored he would get me
he's riding with 20 and 5
but I'm not afeared of that posse
they never will get me alive
One hour ahead of the posse
no turning to left or to right
we must win the race to the river
or there'll be a hanging tonight
one hour ahead of the posse
no time for remorse or regret
but somehow her eyes still haunt me
her laughter is taunting me yet
it started the night that we might
she kissed me and vowed she would care
I traded the gold in pocket
to fondle the curls in her hair
she lied when she told me she loved me
she lied with each kiss that she gave
she lied to the moment I caught her
and now she lies still in her grave
on hour ahead of the posse
the night is a-coming on fast
we must win the race to the rio
and well shake that old posse at last
we're nearing the end of our journey
and now I'm inside of my goal
at last we've beaten the posse
- gun shot -
may the Lord have mercy on my soul

Make way for the Molly Maguires
They're drinkers, they're liars but they're men
Make way for the Molly Maguires
You'll never see the likes of them again
Down the mines no sunlight shines
Those pits they're black as hell
In modest style they do their time
It's Paddy's prison cell
And they curse the day they've travelled far
Then drown their tears with a jar
So make way for the Molly Maguires
They're drinkers, they're liars but they're men
Make way for the Molly Maguires
You'll never see the likes of them again
Backs will break and muscles ache
Down there there's no time to dream
Of fields and farms, of womans arms
Just dig that bloody seam
Though they drain their bodies underground
Who'll dare to push them around
So make way for the Molly Maguires
They're drinkers, they're liars but they're men
Make way for the Molly Maguires
You'll never see the likes of them again
So make way for the Molly Maguires
They're drinkers, they're liars but they're men
Make way for the Molly Maguires
You'll never see the likes of them again

When the light begins to fade
And shadows fall across the sea,
One bright star in the evening sky
Your love's light leads me on my way
There's a dream that will not sleep,
A burning hope that will not die
So I must go now with the wind,
And leave you waiting on the tide
Time to fly, time to touch the sky
One voice alone, a haunting cry
One song, one star burning bright,
May it carry me through darkest night
Rain comes over the gray hills,
And on the air, a soft goodbye
Hear the song that I sing to you
When the time has come to fly

This heart of mine won't keep
Or believe in the secret, like the moss on a stone
This heart of mine won't beat
It just carries itself away
These parting times won't break me
Deserted times stop running
-backwards-
Ar do chul
This form of love won't share
Or give in to a feeling with nothing to gain
No compromise in time
You're so near and yet so far
These parting times won't break me
Deserted times stop running
-backwards-
Ar do chul
And when i turn in silence found
What i say won't let you down
And when your call, outside my door
Ends the searching...

On Raglan Road on an autumn day
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I might one day rue
I saw the danger, yet I passed
Along the enchanted way
And I said, let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day
On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passions pledged
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh, I loved too much and by such, by such
Is happiness thrown away
I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint I did not stint
For I gave her poems to say
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May
On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly
My reason must allow
That I had loved not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay
He'll lose his wings at dawn of day

My biggest fear is I'll let people down and then maybe they'll think less of me
Especially you, you're the jewel in my crown and I don't wanna mess this up
Am I a good enough lover, good enough friend good enough at giving you what you need
Will someone else come along with a much better song and a smile that you wanna trust
You say, "Whatever"
You say, "Who cares?"
You say, "Baby there's no, there there"
You say, "I can"
You say, "I'm gonna, I can do anything I wanna"
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
My life was a stop light, didn't know it turned green, you still didn't honk at me
You waved and I waved and we went on our way, and I knew you were just my type
And now we're under the gun in another recession, are we gonna be alright?
You say, "We can"
You say, "We're gonna, we can do anything we wanna"
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling, feeling
Nothin' but love
Nothin' but love
Nothin' but love
Nothin' but love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
Nothin' but love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
Nothin' but love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
Nothin' but love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love
I was down, but I will get back up, yes I'm feeling your love

You're as soft as the rose
You're as sweet as the honey
You're as warm as the bright morning sun
You're as cool as the breeze on the last days of April
You're as fine as fine can be
You're like time is to space
You're like faith is to trustin'
You're like blue is to feelin' unkind
You're like joy is for love,
You're like dreams are for chasin'
You're as fine as fine can be
And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you
You're my little angel you see
You're as bright as the moon
You're as light as a feather
You're as fine as fine can be
Like the rain is for the crops
You're like food for my thoughts
You're like true is for knowin' what's not
You're like leaves are for trees
You're like bees are for buzzin'
You're as fine as fine can be

Those heartaches now are on their way
What makes you want to be that way
You cheated on me and you lied
Youve put teardrops in my eyes
I found out what they say is true
I hope someday that youll be blue
And then youll know dear why I try
With these teardrops in my eyes
The news is out all over town
That youve been seen out runnin round
I turned my head and gossip flies
'Cause it puts teardrops in my eyes
I found out what they say is true
I hope someday that youll be blue
And then youll know dear why I try
With these teardrops in my eyes
I never thought youd let me down
But now at last I understand
Youve wrecked my life and broke our vow
Youll have to pay for it somehow
I found out what they say is true
I hope someday that youll be blue
And then youll know dear why I try
With these teardrops in my eyes
With these teardrops in my eyes

All the streets are filled with laughter and light
And the music of the season
And the merchants' windows are all bright
With the faces of the children
And the families hurrying to their homes
While the sky darkens and freezes
Will be gathering around the hearths and tables
Giving thanks for God's graces
And the birth of the rebel Jesus
Well they call him by 'the Prince of Peace'
And they call him by 'the Savior'
And they pray to him upon the seas
And in every bold endeavor
And they fill his churches with their pride and gold
While their faith in him increases
But they've turned the nature that I worship in
From a temple to a robber's den
In the words of the rebel Jesus
Well we guard our world with locks and guns
And we guard our fine possessions
And once a year when Christmas comes
We give to our relations
And perhaps we give a little to the poor
If the generosity should seize us
But if any one of us should interfere
In the business of why there are poor
They get the same as the rebel Jesus
Now pardon me if I have seemed
To take the tone of judgement
For I've no wish to come between
This day and your enjoyment
In a life of hardship and of earthly toil
There's a need for anything that frees us
So I bid you pleasure
And I bid you cheer
From a heathen and a pagan
On the side of the rebel Jesus

There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall
Built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay
For they looked in the future and what did they see
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land
All up through the seaports and into their hands
Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done
So over the mountains and over the plains
Into the muskeg and into the rain
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead
Oh the song of the future has been sung
All the battles have been won
O'er the mountain tops we stand
All the world at our command
We have opened up the soil
With our teardrops and our toil
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
And many are the dead men too silent to be real

Listen up brothers and sisters, come hear my desperate tale
I speak of our friends of nature, trapped in the dirt like a jail
Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night
The killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just 'cause a radish can't
scream
CHORUS
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream scream
scream)
Watching their skins being peeled (Having their insides
revealed)
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)
Carrot Juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables grow)
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's as dirty as hell)
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade...)
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two
I'm a political prisoner trapped in a windowless cage
'cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a
rage
I told the judge when he sentenced me, this is my finest hour
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower
CHORUS
How low as people do we dare to stoop
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes, let potted plants free
Don't mash that potato
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream scream
scream)
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir fry are
sealed)

The leaves fall from the trees like gold
And I tell you that I love you so
The river sings, it's time to go
What lies ahead we'll never know
And summer brings sweet memories
When we danced all night on the dusty streets
With an angel watching over me
Your love has brought me to my knees
[Chorus]
Well I've loved you and I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
Yes I've loved you well I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
We kissed under the tired moon
And the stars shone down for me and you
We listen for the cock to crow
Come break of day you had to go
[Chorus]
I didn't want to let you leave
I didn't wanna tell you no
'Cause I know how to make you feel
And I don't wanna let you go
I didn't want to let you leave
I didn't wanna tell you no
'Cause I know how to make you feel
And I don't wanna let you go
Laa la la la ohh
La la la la
[Chorus]
Yes I've loved you well I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
Yes I've loved you well I told you so
Wherever you decide to go
I've loved you well
Wherever you decide to go
I've loved you well
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me

I've been a moonshiner for many a year
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
I'll go to some hollow and I'll set up my still
And I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill
[Chorus:]
I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler,
I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me
You can leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry
And I'll drink when I'm dry
And if moonshine don't kill me
I'll live till I die
I'll go to some hollow in this country
Ten gallons of wash and I'll go on a spree
No woman to follow and the world is all mine
I love none so well as I love the moonshine

Green grows the laurel, soft falls the dew
Sorry was I love when parting from you
But at our next meeting I hope you'll prove true
And we'll join the green laurel and the violet so blue
I once had a sweetheart but now I have none
He's gone and he's left me to weep and to mourn
He's gone and he's left me for others to see
I'll soon find another far better than he
He passes my window both early and late
And the looks that he gives me would make my heart break
The looks that he gives me a thousand would kill
Though hates and detests me I love that lad still
I wrote him a letter in red rosy lines
He wrote back an answer all twisted and twined
Saying keep your love letters and I'll keep mine
You write to your love and I'll write to mine
Now often I wonder why maidens love men
And often I wonder why young men love them
But from my own knowledge I will have you know
The men are deceivers wherever they go
Green grows the laurel, soft falls the dew
Sorry was I love when parting from you
But at our next meeting I hope you'll prove true
And we'll join the green laurel and the violet so blue

Like two dogs on an open road
Like two flowers on an old gravestone
Like two leaves tumblin' in the wind
I'm searchin' for a beginning that has no end
And I'm rollin' with the thunder
Still waitin' for the rain
Rollin' with the thunder
Still waitin' for the rain
Like two boots in a salvation army store
Like two sailors out lookin' for a whore
Two broken windows in a burned out van
I'm a fugitive lookin' for a
One-armed man
Two rings in an old pawn shop
Two dusty winos cussin' out a cop
Two tumbleweeds blowin' across the plain
We're all dry seeds just waitin' for the rain

Alive alive oh
alive alive ohh
Singing cockles and mussels
alive alive ohhh
In Dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty
I once met a girl named sweet Molly Malone
and she wheeled her wheel barrow
through the streets broad and narrow
singing cockles and mussels alive alive oh
She was a fish monger
and sure was no wonder
so were her mother and father before
and they wheeled their wheel barrow
through the streets broad and narrow
singing cockles and mussels alive alive oh
She died of a fever
and so one could save her
and that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
now her ghost wheels her barrow through the streets broad and narrow
singing cockles and mussels alive alive oh

When I was young, I used to wait
On the boss and give him his plate
And pass him the bottle when he got dry
And brush away the blue tail fly
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
And When he would ride in the afternoon
I'd follow after, with a hickory broom
The pony being rather shy
When bitten by blue tail fly
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
One day, he ride around the farm
The flies so numerous, they did swarm
One chanced to bite him on the thigh
The devil take the blue tail fly
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
The pony run, he jumped, he pitch
He threw my master in the ditch
He died and the jury wondered why
The verdict was the blue tail fly
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
They lay him under a 'simmon tree
His epitaph is there to see
"Beneath this stone, I'm forced to lie
Victim of the blue tail fly"
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away

Hello it's me the mistress
Is there anybody home?
'Cause the last place I should be is sittin' here alone
All I ask for is forgiveness
If you've got some give it here
You don't act much like you need it
You don't look much like you care
And will you need me in the summer?
Will you need me in the spring?
I believe my life is ending I don't know where to begin
I've got a page in my back pocket of the seven deadly sins
And its dragging me around among the needles and the pins
And I don't need to take a breather
I'm on the outside looking out
Yeah, I don't need to see your papers
'Cause I know what you're about
You had me by the bible and you had me by the belt
And you had me from the instant my cold love began to melt
And then you praise me for my inspiration
Asked me for an explanation
Followed up with hesitation
Fit my primal expectation
I don't care but I don't mind
You can call me any time
You can holler through the fortress
And kick me out of line
I don't expect it from the grief that gathers in my head
I like suspended disbelief
I like to spend the day in bed
I like to spend the nights in heaven
Hanging with the dead
You know, Judas and his women and the voices in my head
I've got my eyes upon the mirror
I've got my hands up in the air
I confess to my distress yeah, I great crazier each year
You know I'd change it if I could you know I like to say that I would
But there's a war between the parts of me
The evil and the good
And you try and stop me I'm on fire
It doesn't look that way
You know, I used to be a liar
But living's set me straight
I don't come with no disclaimer I'm like everybody else
We keep our demons on the burner and our morals on the shelf
And nobody asks for my opinion because you don't want to hear
I swear I'm only human wishing I could disappear
And you must think its an illusion that I like to live in fear
Of a probable solution of why the devil put me here
And now no judgement call will kill me
Just makes me close my eyes
And I sink into the slumber to the prison of my mind
Where I'd love to introduce you
If you found a way inside
You could sell me retribution and totally demystify
Until I wonder how I got here
Until I don't know who to be
Is it better to be grounded?
Is it better to be free?
Am I better off without you?
Am I happier alone?
Hello, its me the mistress, could you please pick up the phone?

He's tired of getting up
Tired of life
Tired of working at the same old job
And tired of his wife.
Overcome with a desire
To come of age
Better step aside for Johnny
'Cause he's come to take the stage
Take the stage
He's in the territory of poets
Movin' slow
He's in the territory of moving
But not knowing which way to go.
He hides the ring that's on his finger
Made of gold
He's in the territory of poets
And he's doing what he's told
What he's told
Johnny's looking 'round the bar
For a dance
Once he sets his eye on Sally
She doesn't stand a chance
Though the lines that he's rehearsed
Pass her by
When he asks her for a date
She says, Friday would be fine.
How 'bout nine?
He's in the territory of poets
Movin' slow
He's in the territory of moving
But not knowing which way to go.
He hides the ring that's on his finger
Made of gold
He's in the territory of poets
And he's doing what he's told
What he's told
Sally's putting on her dress
Half past eight
Johnny takes a little line of something
Just to keep him straight
Through her shadow and her blush
She shines through
She says her powder makes her feel much better
He says his does too.
His does too.
He's in the territory of poets
Movin' slow
He's in the territory of moving
But not knowing which way to go.
He hides the ring that's on his finger
Made of gold
He's in the territory of poets
And he's doing what he's told
What he's told

calling all the lost souls waiting
for a chance to leave their failings
lightning in the fields of gold
as it strikes a memory you've never known
hold on to the truth its over your head
whats the use in sorrow if it swallows you again
come out of the dark and into the light
our luck may have come so lets uncover it tonight
harnessed by the current in the rip
roaring with the thunder and the wind
drawn into the myth of deceits voice, those soft lips
stuttering ..you were in...in love .. you were in , in love
boiling at the pot the waves went
the struggle is no longer chasing
horizon to the rising sun
get out of the light get out of the light
hold on to the truth its over your head
whats the use in sorrow if it swallows you again
come out of the dark and into the light
our luck may have come so lets uncover it tonight
harnessed by the current in the rip
roaring with the thunder and the wind
drawn into the myth of deceits voice, those soft lips
stuttering ..you were in...in love .. you were in , in love
and the only thing that i was told
always say the way you're feeling
if the sea of hope is calm just surrender to your being
i am all around you if the dark is blinding
i am all around you, we'll run forever with the lighting

I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night
Alive as you and me
Says I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead'
'I never died', says he
'I never died', says he.
In Salt Lake, Joe, says I
Him standing by my side
'They framed you on a murder charge'
Says Joe, 'I never died'
Says Joe, 'I never died.'
The copper bosses they shot you, Joe,
They filled you full of lead
'Takes more than guns to kill a man'
Says Joe, 'And I ain't dead'
Says Joe, 'And I ain't dead.'
And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes
Says Joe, 'What they forgot to kill'
'Went on to organize'
'Went on to organize.'
Joe Hill ain't dead, he says to me
Joe Hill ain't never died
Where working man are out on strike
Joe Hill is at their side
Joe Hill is at their side.
In San Diego up to Maine
In every mine and mill
Where working men defend their rights
It's there you'll find Joe Hill
It's there you'll find Joe Hill.
I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night
Alive as you and me
Says I, But Joe, you're ten years dead
I never died, says he
I never died, says he.

Tonight I'm yours,
And you are mine, now.
But is it love,
Or just summertime, now?
Ooh, the time is right,
Come hold me tight.
Let's grab onto the love that we can borrow.
And let's not hang each other up,
With words that we'll forget about tomorrow.
Cause the things we write in the summer sand,
The "I love you"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand.
You got someone,
And so do I, now.
Our hearts are locked in,
So why should we lie, now?
Bathe with me in harmony.
Let's sing our summer song and sing it sweetly,
For we can't stop the autumn wind that blows away,
The summer sand completely.
Yes, the things we write in the summer sand,
The "I love you"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand.
Oh, the time is right,
Come hold me tight.
Let's grab onto the love that we can borrow.
And let's not hang each other up,
With words that we'll forget about tomorrow.
Cause the things we write in the summer sands,
The "I love you"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand.
Things we write in the summer sands,
The "I love you"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand.

Although the flames they are so dim,
I can see them from over here.
But this is no time to worry now,
No time to shed a tear.
The people are all smiling,
And the letters are all too,
The flowers they are all arranged
And the notes they are all blue.
Where are the words to say to you,
Where do they all begin.
I should not have a lot to lose
And everything to win.
And I want you to be smiling,
I want you not to cry.
And even if I hide away,
Then you'll get the notion why.
A symphony I learnt at school,
In pigeonholes so clear,
But it made me for to write no songs,
For nobody to hear.
And I see you are all smiling
Even in the candle light.
Just close your eyes and fall asleep,
And I think you'll be alright.
Close your eyes and fall asleep,
And I think you'll be alright.

Do you remember how we used to drive
Over the mountain and down to the river bend
Where the ghosts of the valley all haunt the tracks
The highway calls your stories back again
Oh, Jamie, I'm all alone out here, and all I used to know is in the wind
And now, I don't recognize a thing
I need a brand new song to sing
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me we're gonna make it out alive again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear, there's nothing left to hide
So will you look me in the eye, and say we will survive
Someday the truth's gonna lay us bare
We're gonna raise a glass to the past and say
It's only when the straight line breaks and heals a little crooked
That you ever see the grace
Well I had to find a better place; maybe the bend in the river's the only way
And I'm lost -- got all these voices in my head
I need some hope up there instead
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me about the sun that's gonna rise again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear, there's nothing left to hide
So will you look me in the eye, and say we will survive
We will survive
Do you remember how I used to say
Love is a fire and it's gonna burn us up
To make the space for grace to grow
Well, now it feels like love has called my bluff
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me about the love that never dies
Tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me we're gonna make it out alive again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear
There's nothing left to hide
So when you look me in the eye, I know we will survive
We will survive
I know we will survive
I know we will survive

I had a little nut tree nothing would it bare
But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear
The king of spains daughter came to visit me
And all for the sake of my little nut tree
I had a little nut tree nothing would it bare
But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear
I skipped over the water
I danced on the sea
And all the birds in the air couldn't catch me

You won't wake up
You're not dreaming, this is all real
We've been playing
Like we've made sense of such a raw deal
Why'd you listen?
What do we know?
It only looks like
We have something you don't
I lost my faith in our sweet illusion
Where every wound heals
So if you're still there
Let me tell you, this is all real
We felt like angels on the rooftops
Looking down at you
Singing ideas that we'd just read
Drunk on new truth
It seduced me
Soft and silver tongued
With a way out
After all the fun
Shut my eyes flew and hit a brick wall
That wasn't in the deal
If you're still there
Let me tell you, this is all real

Where have all people gone?
Where is your skin when I'm in this bed lying
My shoes seem covered with snow
and I used your words to keep them dry
I'm miles away but I feel you here
I'm far away but closer than yesterday
Cotton is floating and I use it to build a castle
It's weak and fake and useless like
some of the stories I've told to my friends
And I'll play a song to keep you awake
And I'm weightless so I will let the wind take me where you are

Oh list to the lay of a poor Irish harper
And scorn not the strains of his old, withered hands
But remember his fingers, they once could move sharper
To raise up the memory of his dear native land
At a fair or a wake, I could twist my shillelagh
Or trip through a jig with my brogues bound with straw
And all the pretty colleens around me assembled
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh
Oh, how I long to muse on the days of my boyhood
But four score and three years have flitted since then
But they bring sweet reflections, as every young joy should
For, the merry hearted boys makes the best of old men
And when sergeant death, in his cold arms shall embrace me
And lull me to sleep with sweet Erin go bragh
By the side of my Kathleen, my young wife then place me
Then forget Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh

Told my friends that I've had too much
Take me home and to lock me up
I'm a threat and I've had enough
Wait, just wait
Then they bathe me in a crown of thorns
As if the night had not been hard on us
As I make comfort of the bathroom floor
Wait, just wait
Why am I an Honest Man?
if I can't get a dollar for my pain
Why am I an Honest Man?
If I can't waste a minute on your name
Why am I an Honest Man?
If the world's going to knock me on my face
Why am I an Honest Man?
If I can't get a dollar for my pain
This is how I wish the end could be
FIlled with torment and dirty dreams
As the room keeps spinning round me
Stay, just stay

I'm so sorry
I've been in love before and it let me down
Now I'm all grown up no turning back girl
Like a child's heart a play
you know the things we used to say
(you remember baby)
When we were in love we made
(Chorus)
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Girl when you broke out, I thought life would end
Now I'm all strung out
Try'na pick up the pieces once again
It seems no matter what I do
Bad luck has been my best friend
All of the things you used to say
They are just promises
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Memories are the only things
That keeps me holding on, holding on yeah
Remember loving you
All night long
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
(Music Break)
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
It seems no matter what I do
Bad luck has my best friend
Not to me those words you say
They are just promises
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

Hope is your survival
A captive path I lead
No matter where you go
I will find you
If it takes a long long time
No matter where you go
I will find you
If it takes a thousand years
Nachgochema
Anetaha

No matter where you go

In the place with no frontiers
No matter where you go
I will find you
If it takes a thousand years

She stands at the window
Proud Mary, bad news
Demands from the credit
And the sheriff's men too
The wife of a fishermen no longer at sea
She can always find him where whisky flows free
She never called it poverty, the doorstep was clean
Till city hall came calling to show what it means
Chorus
Have you seen it before
The names of good women and men
Decreed by the sword and the pen
To be outlaws all over again.
The names in the churchyard are long overgrown
Still she came kneeling with flowers of her own
They're watching you Mary
In hard times afraid
As counsel finds guilty
For charges unpaid
And even as the last hope is labelled and sold
We're all for one, Mary
Outlawed for gold.

You and I under different stars you dream a lot
and I keep chasing the past
to remind you of who we are,
you've been gone for a while
in a distance another time
when you lay with me in the stillness of night
I'm there where we used to be calling out, calling out
Lay down, lay down on my shoulder, take me to the water,
lets not talk it over
We're islands in an ocean, silences are broken,
lay down on my shoulder as if we were still closer
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far
Feel the rush of my secret heart,
forgive the light was the call of the dark
can you hear what I never said, that I need what you are
Take a minute and look around, take a look we're all alone
you can never cut me out, don't look away now
Take a minute and look around, been away for too long, for too long
Lay down, lay down on my shoulder, take me to the water,
let's not talk it over
We're islands in an ocean, silences are broken,
lay down on my shoulder as if we were still closer
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far
In a night under strange stars, been awake for too long
I'm wondering where you are, how did we go wrong
you and I see the same stars, been awake for too long, for too long
Lay down, lay down on my shoulder, take me to the water,
let's not talk it over
We're islands in an ocean, silences are broken,
lay down on my shoulder as if we were still closer
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far
but we're too far, drifting too far

The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him
His father's sword he hath girded on
And his wild harp slung behind him
"Land of Song!" cried the warrior bard
(Should) "Tho' all the world betrays thee
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"
The Minstrel fell! But the foreman's steel
Could not bring that proud soul under
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again
For he tore its chords asunder
And said "No chains shall sully thee
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
They shall never sound in slavery!

Some people have dogs for pets
And some people have cats but
There was a tailor, had a mouse
Hi diddle um come feed a
They lived together in one house
Hi diddle um come feed a
Hi diddle um, come tintrum tantrum
Through the town of Ramsey
Hi diddle um, come over the lea
Hi diddle um come feed a
The tailor had a tall silk hat
Hi diddle um come feed a
The mouse he ate it, fancy that
Hi diddle um come feed a
Hi diddle um, come tintrum tantrum
Through the town of Ramsey
Hi diddle um, come over the lea
Hi diddle um come feed a
The tailor, he chased him over the lea
Hi diddle um come feed a
The last of that mouse he never did see
Hi diddle um come feed a
Hi diddle um, come tintrum tantrum
Through the town of Ramsey
Hi diddle um, come over the lea
Hi diddle um come feed a

Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
On a summer day
In the month of May
A burly bum came ahiking
Down a shady lane
Through the sugar cane
He was looking for his liking
As he strolled along
He sang a song
Of the land of milk and honey
Where a bum can stay
For many a day
And he won't need any money
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
The cops have wooden legs
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
The barns are full of hay
I want to go where there ain't no snow
Where the sleet don't fall and the wind don't blow
In that Big Rock Candy Mountain
There's a lake of gin
We can both jump in
And the handouts grow on bushes
In the new-mown hay
We can sleep all day
And the bars all have free lunches
Where the mail train stops
And there ain't no cops
And the folks are tender-hearted
Where you never change your socks
And you never throw rocks
And your hair is never parted
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
Oh, a farmer and his son,
They were on the run
To the hay field they were bounding
Said the bum to the son,
"Why don't you come
To that big rock candy mountain?"
So the very next day
They hiked away,
The mileposts they were counting
But they never arrived
At the lemonade tide
On the big rock candy mountain
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
1. One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fires were burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
He said, "Boys, I'm not turning
I'm heading for a land that's far away
Beside the crystal fountain
I'll see you all this coming fall
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
Chorus:
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain,
It's a land that's fair and bright,
The handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.
The boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the sleet don't fall
And the winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Chorus:
3. In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
You never change your socks
And little streams of alkyhol
Come trickling down the rocks
O the shacks all have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And ginger ale too
And you can paddle
All around it in a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
The cops have wooden legs
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The box-cars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the sleet don't fall
And the winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain,
The jails are made of tin.
You can slip right out again,
As soon as they put you in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Chorus:

BOULAVOGUE
(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
"Arm! Arm!" he cried, "for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die."
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

I once knew this angel
Who lived in the desert
And late at night
When the moon was full
Wed lay together
In a pool of water
Look up at the sky
And our hearts would soar
As we imagined a world
Where dreams come true
Free of cruel people
Who divide us
I don't know
If I'll ever see that world
But I still look up at the sky
And never stop...
Wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
Wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
Wishing on all rainbows
That I see
Wishing on all people
Who really dream
I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments
That we've spent
I just can't let you go from me
Oh, yes, we were meant to be
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
Make the best of things, Oh baby
When were together
Whether or never
And I didn't mean to hurt you
Oh, but I know
That in the game of love
You reap what you sow
Wishin' on a star
I'm wishing on a star
I once knew this angel
Who lived in the desert
And late at night
When the moon was full...

While I'd like a glass of whiskey,
It will not change my mind.
So if it's offered for that reason,
Or if you're just being kind.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
I won`t try to explain.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
It`s much too hard, to explain.
So take some comfort in that whiskey,
It`s often been my friend,
And if it warms a lonely body,
Well who`s to say it`s bad.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
I won`t try to explain.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
It`s much too hard, to explain.
If kindness takes a little longer
It`s worth the extra time,
Some have lives so long in darkness,
They don`t even recognise the light.
Understand, there`s a child in everyone,
We should watch what we say.
Everyone has their battles and their pain,
Hidden somewhere away.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
I won`t try to explain.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
It`s much too hard, to explain.

Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like a rose so fair
She's got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands
I love the ground whereon she stands
I love my love and well she knows
I love the ground whereon she goes
And how I wish the day would come
When she and I can be as one
Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like a rose so fair
She's got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands
I love the ground whereon she stands
I go to the Clyde and mourn and weep
Satisfied I never will sleep
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death ten thousand times

The mist has cleared from Muckish Hill
Our parting coming nearer
The last embrace, the final touch
With nothing more to say
Nothing more to say
As silence fell around the bridge
Not a single word was spoken
A bitter breeze, a lonely stream
Echoed through the Glen
Echoed through the Glen
Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor
Memories fade with passing age
In forlorn hope we wait for
Distant hills still haunt us now
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor
Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor

(Child)
Daddy would you sing me a lullaby?
Take my hand and Ill walk you through the fire.
Fear no evil I will cover you my child.
And when the waves come crashing all around,
I will be the one to lift you off the ground.
And when you hear this lullaby,
Know I think of you every time.
Because youre my night light,
My night light,
Youre the night light in my dark.
Take my hand and Ill walk you down the aisle
Let her look to be the grace behind your smile
Find a love that mirrors who we are
Keep the wonder in your eyes and shine like stars
And when you feel the tears well up inside,
Just call my name and Ill let you cry.
Because you are my night light,
My night light,
Youre my night light in my dark.
And when you feel the tears well up inside,
Just call my name.
Call my name.
Youre my night light,
My night light.
Youre the night light in my dark
(Children)
Youre my night light,
My night light.
Youre the night light in my dark.
Youre the night light in my dark.
Cause youre my night light.

I bought me an auto, an '81 Ford Escort Wagon
Now the fan it be broke and the tail-pipe it be draggin'
I feel like a schlemiel, my mechanic's fit for hangin'
I got to go to Rust Check , 'bout the price I'll be hagglin'
I can't drive it home because the muffler it be saggin'
Got a car full of pain
Satan's is my engine, Beelzebub's in my trunk
Mephistopheles' at the wheel because I'm too gosh darn drunk
Baal's my passenger and Lucifer's beside him
A demon's in the coolant, I got bats in the transmission
This Escort needs an exorcism, Pan is to blame
Got a car full of pain
I put a tiger in my tank, I let a champ spark my gas
Now I got's a demon in the hood, a pain in the ass
I think the seats are broken (Oh, no)
Okay play us some blues on that harp
Blind Lemon Trevor!
[Insert Trevor's cool harmonica solo here]
Please, please mister, take your blessed wrench
Cast out this demon horde and replace the brimstone stench
With the smell of gasoline, a heavenly muffled roar
I'll worship you oh Speedy man, Mister Goodwrench even more
Let it run, let it run, let it run, oh God, let it run
And now it purrs just like a kitten, it roars just like a lion (Roar!? What?)
I purrs just like a temple golden carved by the Mayans
Here comes the mechanic, oh no, how much?
Four hundred bucks, you piece of slime, you smell and you suck
Your father was a jackal, your mom's his sister's bitch
Got a car full of pain
Yeah I got a car full of pain
I got a car full of pain
I got a car full of pain
Got a car full of pain
I got a car full of pain
I got a car full of pain
Car full of, car full of, car full of pain
Hey

All my lovers think I'm lovely in the morning when I wake
When I roll in folds of slumber when I caress I give and take
All my enemies are just like me they're a fatalist mistake
An abandoning of deities the slowest interstate
Let the bakers have their dozens
Let the coppers get their man
Let doctor lawyer fix her for you
Catch her if they can
Oh and all the stars in heaven
Cannot count on me alone
For I'm a lovers enemy
And I can't be counted on
All my lovers under cover of night wrestle with their wounds
They're pawing sorrows piety they're kissing pleasures gloom
All my enemies are ready for a drink or two to spite
They're praying for forgiveness and they're ready for a fight
Let the bakers have their dozens
Let the coppers get their man
Let doctor lawyer fix her for you
Catch her if they can
Oh and all the stars in heaven
Cannot count on me alone
For I'm a lovers enemy
And I can't be counted on
All my lovers love me tirelessly the listen and they see
They work the web of time itself to fall and capture me
All my enemies they envy every move I've ever made
The tireless love I gather even rain on my parade
Let the bakers have their dozens
Let the coppers get their man
Let doctor lawyer fix her for you
Catch her if they can
Oh and all the stars in heaven
Cannot count on me alone
For I'm a lovers enemy
And I can't be counted on

I hear some people get married in the park on Sunday afternoon
And all their friends bring pretty flowers while the band plays a happy
Tune Now do you want me, do you need me, Do you love me like I love you?
Ooo
What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?
Maybe we should wait 'til night to join hands 'neath the stars above
And we'll be kissing our first kiss by moonlight as we vow eternal love
Now do you want me, do you need me, Do you love me like I love you? Ooo
What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?
Now do you want me, do you need me, baby
Love me like I love you?
What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you

I saw you holding hands with the moon
Scented fingers fill the room
It's making me thin
All this pulling you in
It tears me apart
And I'm back to the start
I can't rest
I can't rest
I can't rest
Knowing this
I can't rest
Mouths that open up to me
Speak with pearls of wisdom teeth
The seraphin know your sins
And they impart to my human heart
I am blessed
In this unrest
I am blessed
In this unrest
Oh...
I saw you holding hands with the moon
Left feeling empty
My cold and barren womb
that makes me thin
with every spin as
we revolve
There's no resolve
I am blessed
In this unrest
I am blessed
In this unrest
In unrest

Me work hard five days a week
Sweeping garbage from the street
Come home not want book to read
Not 'nuff pictures for me see
Sit right down in favourite chair
Wearing only underwear
Favourite night is Saturday night
'Cause me can watch hockey fights
Me like hockey! Me like hockey!
Me no like pro basketball
'Cause me short and they all tall
Baseball slow like Forrest Gump
'Cept when Robbie spits on ump
Wrestlemania not so great
Me like to see Hulk Hogan skate
TV soccer not that hot
You play bad then you get shot
Me like hockey! Me like hockey!
Swedish players must be geeks
'Cause they still got own real teeth
Not like Finnish players names
What's a Teemu anyway?
Russians worst in history
Got stupid names like Valerie
Me like Sergei Federov
Me like him more if head were off
Ha ha ha!
Me like hockey! Me like hockey!
Me like hockey! We like hockey!
Please mister linesman let the players fight
Please mister linesman let the players fight
Please mister linesman let the players fight
Please mister linesman let the players fight
Let them fight, let them fight, let them fight
Let them fight, let them fight, let them fight
Let them fight, let them fight!
Friends come over put game on
Argue then we lay bets down
Got bag of chips and case of Bud
Should last 'til end of first period
But yankees they win the world cup
Me think they cheat use glowy puck
Maybe if we want to win her
Maybe we should play in winter
Me like hockey! Me like hockey!
Me like hockey! Me like hockey!
Yeah!

Can't tell the end from the start
But I know how it will be
I'm gonna hijack your heart
You'll belong to me
The furthest thing from your mind
But you can't see what I see
Sugar, I prophesy
You will turn to me, yeah
So you think you're immune?
Well, you believe what you please
'Cause when I call the tune
You will never be free
You'll belong to me

Seventy-six trombones led the big parade
With a hundred and ten cornets close at hand.
They were followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuo-
Sos, the cream of ev'ry famous band.
Seventy-six trombones caught the morning sun
With a hundred and ten cornets right behind
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds
There were horns of ev'ry shape and kind.
There were copper bottom tympani in horse platoons
Thundering, thundering all along the way.
Double bell euphoniums and big bassoons,
Each bassoon having it's big, fat say!
There were fifty mounted cannon in the battery
Thundering, thundering louder than before
Clarinets of ev'ry size
And trumpeters who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score!

While in the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
"Hurrah me soul" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load "hurray !" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down
the rocky road and all the way to Dublin,
Whack follol de rah !

Somethin gotta give with the way Im livin
Seems Im gettin down everyday
The more I strive, the less Im alive
And it seems I'm gettin further away
Oh well, all my superstitions
And my crazy suspicions
Of the people that I care about
I've been doin more screamin
Than I've been doin dreamin
And I think its time I figured it out
Yeah, baby I need a plan, oh, to understand
That life aint only supply and demand
I've been goin joggin in the park after dark
Draggin round with me my ball and chain
Took southern skies to make me realize
That Im causin myself this pain
Well, the woman that Im lovin
Yeah, Im pushin and shovin
Getting further on by the day
And I cant understand
How the heart of this man
Ever let it end up this way
Baby, I need a plan, oh, to understand
That life aint only supply and demand
When the road gets dark and lonesome, dear
You can find me here
But honey, you dont know where I am
You need a friend, yeah
Life aint easy, in fact I know its sleazy
When youre the big man in town
Shakin religions and makin decisions
You never get to slow on down
Well, your wife and your baby
You tell them, Yeah, well maybe
Ill meet yall at a weekend resort
But your eye's on the prize
And you cant realize
That your little girls lifes so short
Brother, you need a plan, oh, to understand
That life aint only supply and demand
Yeah, sister you need a plan, oh, to understand
That life aint only supply and demand
Hey, you better figure it out now
You know you aint comin back down, yeah
You better figure it out now
You know you aint comin back down

If you'll step inside this great glass elevator
It'll take us up above the city lights
To where the planet curves away to the equator
I want to show you something fine
You can see the roads that we all traveled just to get here
A million minuscule decisions in a line
Why they brought us to this moment isn't clear
But that's all right, we've got all night
Could it be that the many roads
You took to get here
Were just for me to tell this story
And for you to hear this song
And your many hopes
And your many fears
Were meant to bring you here all along
So if you'll trust me with your time I'll spend it wisely
I will sing to you with all I have to give
If you traveled all this way, then I will do my best to play
My biggest hits (that don't exist)
And if you'll lend to me your ear I'll sing 'em pretty
I will never, ever sing 'em out of tune
And I will not forget the words,
of any chorus, bridge, or verse
I promise you
CHORUS
We've got Benjamin to play that old piano
If we're lucky it's a little out of tune
We've got Andy on the guitar 'cause I promised him
Some Texas barbecue
How I love to watch you listen to the music
'Cause you sing to me a music of your own
As I cast out all these lines, so afraid that I will find
I am alone, all alone
Could it be that the many roads
I took to get here
Were just for you to tell that story
And for me to hear that song
And my many hopes
And my many fears
Were meant to bring me here all along
We were meant to be right here all along

Running like hell through the trees,
No one pressuring me
Younger days
Getting out after school
Playing a bunch of fools
Younger days
I see the sunset I see the stars
I see the future oh my god like a train approaching
It's coming for me
Slipping my Jordans on
Playing some one on one
Younger days
Telling my sister I hate her
Knowing I'd never trade her
Younger days
I see the sunset I see the stars
I see the future oh my god like a train approaching
It's coming for me
Oh these younger days
I'll take to my grave
For carving me out of a stone
Oh these younger days
I'll never replace
Oh if only I'd known
Hearing my fathers joys
Cracking my mothers voice
Younger voice
Filling my pockets with paper
Smoking em deep in the woods
Younger days
I see the sunset I see the stars
I see the future oh my god like a train approaching
It's coming for me
Oh these younger days
I'll take to my grave
For carving me out of a stone
Oh these younger days
I'll never replace
Oh if only I'd known
I see the sunset I see the stars
I see the future
Ohhh my god

I dream a day that god will surface
To retrieve his nails and open your heart.
You'll say you're mine for the ages
Just open your heart and say
"I swear on the cross"
Can you promise this to the grave you'll take my name?
Can you promise me?
Overseas and over mountains
A thousand years I've waited for her
To say the lines "from this day forward"
Just open your heart and say
"I swear on the cross"
Can you promise that to the grave you'll take my name?
Can you promise me?
All this time I've prayed for this day to come true,
No one knows how deep the waves we waded through.
I wish I could take your hand and make it true.
Cause no one knows how far apart we've stayed to get through.
I wish I could take your hand and make it true.
Cause no one knows how far apart we stay to get through.
Can you say "I swear on the cross"
Can you promise that to the grave you'll take my name?
Can you promise me?

He used to send her flowers
To apologise, to apologise
He used to say how sorry he was
And flash his smile; he'd flash his smile
And always she'd forgive him
'Cause he'd mean it for a while
And then he'd send her flowers
To apologise, to apologise
It wasn't that he meant her harm
I realise, I realise
It's just that life had taken him
By surprise, by surprise
At times he knew he'd failed her
At times he really tried
When times were worst, he did his best
To compromise, to compromise
I told her once he'd break her heart
But that wasn't true, wasn't true
'Cause broken things can be repaired
And held onto, held onto
But her heart had been shattered
The pieces lay inside
In fragments much too tiny
To recognise, to recognise
I look now at the weariness
That lies in his eyes, in his eyes
And who am I to lay the blame
Or criticize, or criticize?
He's sorry that he's living
He's sorry he's alive
He's sorry of the need
To apologise, to apologise

I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine
I had a little stretch of land along the C.P. Line
But times went by, and though I tried, the money wasn't there
And bankers came and took my land, and told me "fair is fair".
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no
"Hire you now," they'd always laugh, "we just let twenty go!"
The government, they promised me a measly little sum
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum
Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone,
I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan.
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Well, you'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large
But just the other day I found an unprotected barge
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser
I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer.
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver
'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is hidin' in the bay,
I'll jump the bridge and knock 'em cold and sail off with their hay.
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Well, Mountie Bob, he chased me, he was always at my throat
He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat,
But cutbacks were a-coming, so the Mountie lost his job
So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob.
A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company,
I never pay my income tax and screw the G.S.T. (Screw it!)
Sailin' down the Saskatoon, the terror of the sea
If you wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Well pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here
I hear in north Alberta there's a band of buccaneers
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay
And you're gonna lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way
Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze
I'll be back in springtime, but now I have to go
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico.
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day
Boss Man, Boss Man turn it around
If you don't look away how can I sit down
Look at this load upon my back
Gotta get this wheel back on the track
I can't hold on but I can't let go
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no'
Holes in my pockets and holes in my shoes
If you're ready for me I'm ready for you
The company plan takes all my pay
Got a child in July and another last May
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day
Push your face down in the coal
'Cause you got no heart you got no soul
Country life's the life for me
In ten more years I'll a pensioner be
The younger lad knows when the girls are out
But you might say he's a rural sprout
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day
Boss Man, Boss Man clear the track
You're gonna tear the skin right offa my back
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
If you can't lend a hand then get outta my way
It'll be murder in the first degree
If you ever lay your hands on me
Boss Man, Boss Man pay my rent
A dollar I've earned is a dollar I've spent
The company plan takes all my check
For breakin' my back and riskin' my neck
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day
I can't hold on but I can't let go
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no

I'm a headless horseman on quilted sand dunes
With my neck wide open, I pray for refuge
'Cause since I've been found I've been living a life in cages
Withering down to the champagne quicksand
Wrestling doubt I've been dragging around for ages
I tried to let it drain but my veins are hopeless
'Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup
I'm a tritone bible with misprint logic
I count lunar cycles with faithless prophets
'Cause since I've been found I've been living a life in cages
Withering down to the champagne quicksand
Wrestling doubt I've been dragging around for ages
I tried to let it drain but my veins are hopeless
'Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup
I'm a mountainless valley
Never comforted crashing
I'm just another stone on broken walls
Racing the winds in a hurricane
I'm not as brave as I once was
I've been kicking these rocks in a river
And they've been sinking low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Oh they've been going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
I mean, I lied, how long?
'Cause they've been sinking low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Won't keep a promise I can't make
'Cause I've been going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
'Cause I loved in cold blood and got used to it
Angels say trust the detox
But I'm shaking I need it like bourbon in my coffee cup
Low, low, low, low, low
We've been going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low
Going low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low

I spend my days watching TV with a beer
(ooh-ahh, you're fat)
This seems to have caused my upper belly to appear
(ooh-ahh, you're fat)
Then one day, my woman went and left me
(she did not want to sleep with a whale)
She said she found someone more manly
(a body that could not fail)
So I went and I looked into the mirror
(you look like a big tub of goo)
And I dreamed of being big and manly
(dreaming is the best you can do)
I though to myself, what would I ask for
(if someone gave you a wish)
I think I'd like to look like my hero
(he's one big manly bisch)
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I don't want to be fat and weak, oh no, oh no
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I want a manly physique
I put down the cheetos and I went on a crash diet
(carrots were all you ate)
Then I noticed that my skin was turning orange
(you're just a big mistake)
Then I overdosed on diet pills
(too bad you did not die)
Still I want to look like my idol
(the great big beefy guy)
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I don't want to be fat and weak, oh no, oh no
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I want a manly physique
I bought myself a weight set and some steriods
(to make you big and strong)
And I worked out really really hard
(but it did not last for long)
I put out my back, and the steroids made me sterile
(not like it mattered anyway)
And about looking like my hero
(he has one thing to say)
I don't want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I don't mind being fat and weak, oh no, oh no
I don't want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
It's easier being fat and lazy
You'll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
You'll always be fat and weak, oh yes, oh yes
You'll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
You are fat and ugly

I Know My Love
I know my love by his way of walking,
And I know my love by his way of talking
And I know my love by his suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?
Cho: And still she cried:"I love him the best
But a troubled mind, sure, can get no rest."
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?"
There is a dance house in Maradyke
Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

Jug Of Punch
'Twas early, early, in the month of June
I was sitting with my glass and spoon.
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was a jug of punch.
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was a jug of punch.
If I were sick, and very bad
And were not able to go or stand,
I would not think it at all amiss
To pledge my shoes for a jug of punch.
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
I would not think it at all amiss
To pledge my shoes for a jug of punch.
What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire,
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And upon his table a jug of punch.
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
Toor-a-loora-la, toor-a-loora-lie
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And upon his table a jug of punch.
And when I'm dead and in my grave
No costly tombstone will I have,
I'll dig a grave both wide and deep
With a jug of punch at my head and feet.

Lately I
I've been heading for a breakdown
Every time I leave my house
Well, it feels just like a shake down
Between street sweepers and the pushers are the lawyers
Who may as well be butchered
Between the small timing hustlers who all
Seem to feed upon each other
Oh, God, why you been
Hanging out in that ol' violin
While I've been waiting for
ou
To pull me through?
Lately I
Every time I try to lie down
While my mind just lets away
I can't even close my eyes now
Between the big fish and ambition and the lovers
Using words as ammunition
Between the wood planks, I've been pacing endless
Impossible dream that I've been chasing
Oh, God, why you been
Hanging out in that ol' violin
While I've been waiting for you
To pull me through?
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh, God, why you been
Hanging out in that ol' violin
While I've been waiting for you
To pull me through?
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh, God

Over dosage, and we flowi'n just like ocean's motion
We makin' that mixture of hits, we call it magic potion
I'm going out my mind and we still DIY
So when you need to find the rhythm with the meter, well its on that time
And we still on the grind, NYC to the Georgia line
It's so important, I'm banging out beats 'til the world is mine
I know that's sounding lame, but I really wanna make a change
And make the newest thing something that I know you'll sing
I think we far from vain
Make it all swing likes its off the chain
Hip hop's the blood in me but the rock 'n roll supplies my brain
I'm so exhausted man, ain't got a free minute to be offering
There ain't no altering and everyone in the place ought to sing
This hook
Chorus:
I said bounce for the encore
Overseas and on shore
now i think they feeling on me
I said sing it with your hands up
Now its time to stand up
Now I think they feeling on me
I just wanna rock
I just wanna roll
I just wanna..la la la lose control
I just wanna rock
I just wanna roll
I just wanna..la la la lose control
Open dopeness so we soldiers
And they afraid to approach us
We slappin' them contacts in
Because we need to focus
We spread it like the locus
We cleaner then all the soap is
Watch for the hotness popping up quick 'cuz now they know they toasted
Over bearing, daring, scaring
We making these people weary
No need to run and hide, we sweeter than all the cherries
And all this envy varies
They carry haters here
But I hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, dear
And I really wanna make this clear so you can see the light
'Cuz I was born with more drive then a Ducati bike
So when we outtie 5, we leaving out on top
Let the beat roll hard enough that we guarantee the chorus drop
Like this
Chorus

Sitting by the roadside on a summer's day
Chatting with my mess-mates, passing time away
Laying in the shadows underneath the trees
Goodness how delicious eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Eating goober peas
Goodness how delicious
Eating goober peas
When a horse-man passes, the soldiers have a rule
To cry out at their loudest, "Mister, here's your mule?"
But another pleasure enchanting-er than these
Is wearing out your grinders, eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Eating goober peas
Is wearing out your grinders
Eating goober peas
Just before the battle, the General hears a row
He said, "The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now"
He turns around in wonder and what do you think he sees?
The Georgia Militia eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Eating goober peas
The Georgia Militia
Eating goober peas
I think my song has lasted almost long enough
The subject's interesting but the rhymes are mighty tough
I wish this war was over and free from rags and fleas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, and gobble goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Gobble goober peas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts
And gobble goober peas

Fallen Angels
Fallen Angels
I got a man in the business line
He power hungry, he's a money mine
Smooth as satin he's a big time shark
Fallen Angel
I got a brother, oo he mean as sin
He got a brother who's just like him
Livin' over in Moscow, 2 of a kind.
How come the great power got the junkie mind
Fallen Angels
They never get enough
Fallen Angels oo oo
They got the addictions
Fallen Angels
They litter the skies
Fallen Angels
Don't you wanna turn 'em around
Turn 'em around
I got a man in the USA
He runnin' guns with the CIA
He's the best that being bad can be
Who'd think he do it all for me
What's it matter if you're green or red
The Yankee dollar or the commie threat
When the real power in the real world
Gonna deny it all anyway
Fallen Angels
They never get enough
Fallen Angels oo oo
They got the addictions
Fallen Angels
They litter the skies
Fallen Angels
Don't you wanna turn 'em around
Turn 'em around
You believe in the system from the top on down
Potential is a beautiful thing
It's hard to keep believing in the big time
Now you're sinking in the wind
Star light, star bright
Somebody going down tonight
Told the truth when it was time to lie
Got it right
Fallen Angels
They never gel enough
Fallen Angels hoo hoo
They got the addictions
Fallen Angels
They litter the skies
Fallen Angels
Don't you wanna turn 'em around
Turn 'em around

You know something girl? I'm thinking about you right now.
You don't want to know what I'm thinking, girl.
Or... or do you?
Girl, you think I'm the bomb,
but I'm old enough to be dating your mom. And I did.
She wasn't that bad, but you're grounded if you tell your dad
that you like the way we dance, with rock-hard abs and plastic pants.
You give us teddy bears,
and in return we shave our chest hairs. Yeah, we're so manly.
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.
Never see a dime for selling out to the man.
Yeah, we're a boy band.
We say we met in church, but we're a product to market research.
We sing about sex, to little girls who shouldn't think about sex yet.
It's not like they listen, it's not like they care.
'Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten.
We like the color blue. (blue, blue)
And we're appearing at a mall near you, right beside the food court.
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.
No one likes us here, but we're big in Japan.
Yeah, we're a boy band.
Throw your hands up in the air,
and wave them around like you just don't care.
You just don't care, you just don't care,
now bring your hands down from the air.
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot ahh ahh ahh ahh.
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.
The words are stupid and the music's bland.
Another pollutant in the pop wasteland.
Yeah, we're a boy band.
Yeah, we're a boy band.
Yeah, we're a boy band.

Bluebird blue
flew by caught my eye
and I fell in love with blue
don't know what to do
sweet song lead me on
I just want to follow you
oh, blue
mmm
Walked down to the edge of the wood
I know I shouldn't go
but it makes me feel so good
tall leaves cover me in
and you sing me, dee-de-dee
I feel so understood
falling so deep
to a warm summer sleep
caught in a rhyme, losing track of the time
no direction to find
Bluebird blue
stay here I know you're near
I just wanna be wit you
don't know what to do
Your song is sweet I forget my feet
won't you let me dance with you
oh blue
mmm
Take in your flight
on a warm summer night
fly back to me
I'll forgive every need
just a tangle in the weeds
bluebird blue
flew by caught my eye
and I fell in love in you
oh, blue
mmm

As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

Upon the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears
Waiting through the years
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreaming of a kiss
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home
But now the bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist
Dreaming of a kiss
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone
To take her home

Why do you whisper, green grass,
Why tell the trees what ain't so?
Whispering grass,
The trees don't have to know.
Why tell them all your secrets,
Who kissed there long ago?
Whispering grass,
The trees don't need to know.
Don't you tell it to the breeze,
'Cause she will tell the birds and bees,
And everyone will know
Because you told them once before.
Yes you told them once before,
It's no secret anymore.
Why tell them all the old things,
They're buried under the snow.
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees,
'Cause the trees don't need to know.
Now don't you tell it to the breeze
'cause she will tell the birds and bees,
And everyone will know
Because you told them once before.
Yes you told them once before,
It's no secret anymore.
Why tell them all the old things,
They're buried under the snow.
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees,
'Cause the trees don't need to know.

Dear thoughts are in my mind and my soul it soars enchanted
As I hear the sweet lark sing in the clear air of the day
For a tender beaming smile to my hope has been granted
And tomorrow he shall hear all my fond heart longs to say
I will tell him all my love, all my soul's pure adoration
And I know he will hear my voice and he will not answer me nay
It is this that gives my soul all it's joyous elation
As I hear the sweet lark sing in the clear air of the day

Well it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog,
It's all for me beer and tobacco.
For I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.
Where are me boots, me noggin', noggin' boots,
They're all gone for beer and tobacco.
For the heels they are worn out and the toes are kicked about
And the soles are looking out for better weather.
Well it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog,
It's all for me beer and tobacco.
For I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.
Where is me shirt, me noggin', noggin' shirt,
It's all gone for beer and tobacco,
For the collar is all worn, and the sleeves they are all torn,
And the tail is looking out for better weather.
Well it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog,
It's all for me beer and tobacco.
For I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.
I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed,
Since first I came ashore from me slumber,
For I spent all me dough on the lassies don't you know,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.
Well it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog,
It's all for me beer and tobacco.
For I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.

Pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face
She left me not knowin' what to do
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied
With knowin' I got no one left to blame
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you

The Poison Glen
Way up there in the poison glen
The sun's going down on the misty mountain
And I'm watching
And wondering
Feeling something from long ago
Haunted echo that surrounds the glen
The heather creeping through
The burned out ruins
And I'm watching
And wondering
Feeling spirits of long ago
Who in the valley shed the poison tear?
No one knows
An old legend of a mythical hero
And I'm watching
And wondering
Feeling something from long ago
May this vale be my silver lining
Pleasing nature with a heart's desire
And I'm watching
And wondering
Feeling everything from long ago

I praise you for the rivers the mountains and the streams
I praise you for the eagle, the visions and the dreams
I praise all your creations the mountains and the streams
I praise you for the eagle, the visions and the dreams
I praise you for my children the mountains and the streams
I praise you for the eagle, the visions and the dreams
I praise you for my people the mountains and the streams
I praise you for the eagle, the visions and the dreams
The visions and the dreams, the visions and the dreams

Last Night I couldn't sleep
The bed felt awful cold
You say you want some space
You say you want some space
You won't pick up the phone
I never said that I was easy
Always pushing for the best
Well that's just because i believe
I believe in you baby
And this i must confess
You make me happy
You make me happy
You shouldn't be alone
Baby come on home
And make me happy
Your hiding in the corner
You've got nothing to hide
You think i'd let you close
You think i'd let you close
If you weren't good on the inside
And I see how you try
I want you all the time
You think your wings are broken
Your wings they aren't broken
I wish you wouldn't fold them
You make me happy
You make me happy
You shouldn't be alone
Baby come on home
And make me happy

From the haze in your chambers
To the legs on the stage
I'm consumed by your danger
I can lose my restraint yeah
I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I'll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on
The view from the trails from the vapors
That we burn from a kiss
Heats the stars that we strangle
And it's proof we exist
I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I'll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on

Here we are again - where all that I am is never enough to bring me the truth. So I turn to you to make me complete and justify me.
So I'll hold on to you, if you hold on to me.
Hold on to me when all that you see is falling apart right at the seams. When you're at the end of your rope, just hold on to me. Why can't you see I'm falling apart right at the seams? I'm hanging by a thread.
A heart and a soul are caught between bones - the emptiness it rings. When I am alone, somehow I know the words that you speak could never save me.
But I'll hold on to you, if you hold on to me.
When you hold on to me, why can't you see I'm falling apart right at the seams? I hold on to you like you hold on to me, but we're falling apart now.

I've been waiting
For you to say the words
As we sail across the universe
Entertaining
You bring me to a stare
As you wave your heart into the air
I walk away
And play it safe
It's strange
How it works
Take your vices
And throw them in the drain
While you're laughin' in the pouring rain
Are you sorry?
Well can you find the words?
You just say the lines that you've rehearsed
I'll walk away
And play it safe like you
I just walk away and play it cool
It's strange
How it works
Just walk away and play it cool
It's strange
How it works

Met a young lady at the bottom of a bottle
said her name was Isobel and I told her my home
said where you been darling, she said living out a suitcase
walking barefoot on the long way home (she goes)
Hair full of daisies, eyes filled wonder
said her life were living is is just a game
sat by the campfire she told me a story
we laughed and cried, till the morning came
All is well, all is fine
all is well with Isobel
drinking her wine
[Instrumental Break]
Well her daddy left her when she was five
and her momma didn't wanna stick around and be alive
Isobel ran, Isobel escaped
into the lords arms she was saved
Every night before bed, Isobel would pray
ask to be a bird and fly away
she didn't grow wings but her spirit grew strong
and she picked up her things and started walking along
All is well, all is fine
all is well with Isobel
drinking her wine
Me and Isobel walking the sunset, barefoot on the long way home
me and Isobel walking the sunset, on the long and winding road

I hear no voices telling me what to do
my heart is broken
and I feel too small when I am by your side
I don't know what to say
bad luck surround us
I should accept I was just something you used when you felt down
I know I am stupid 'cause I stay around
And I wish you walked away
You walked in the rain
I cooked something to eat
you came all the way down when I was here
trying to tell me
stay away 'cause she is not real
she reads about nature in magazines
And I wish you walked away
You don't know how it feels to have the chance of telling all about these secrets I kept inside
and screw it all by staying in silence
And I wish you walked away
And I wish you walked away
And I wish you walked away
And I wish I walked away

If you want me I'll be at your door
And if you need me I'll be by your side
'cause every day is a long winding road
And I'll always be here don't you know
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
I always try, I wonder why, I wonder why
[Chorus]
Every time I look at you I feel the blues
Can't hide the pain inside
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
Never in a million years I thought the tears could break a heart of stone
If you need me let me know
Well, if you've got no-one to give your heart to
And if you've searched and you can't find the truth
When they tell you this time to let go
Well, I'll always be here - don't you know
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
[Chorus]
Oh, nobody told me bout the wind and the trees
And the summer breeze and
You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders
And the light is slipping through
And I've seen the sun catching your eye
Like the moon in the sky
Every time I look at you I feel the blues
Can't hide the pain inside
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
And though you've never asked me to believe its true
I've loved you from the start
Oh I've got to find a way to mend today
These wings that need to fly
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
Never in a million years I thought the tears could break a heart of stone
If you need me let me know

She doesn't wanna have to move to Xanadu
She doesn't wanna lay in bed all day with you
She'll do anything you tell her not to do
She's gonna paint your white picket fence all black and blue
She won't drive into the Grand Canyon with you
She already knows you went and got her name tattooed
She's a lipstick anarchist
She doesn't wanna bake a birthday cake for you
She doesn't wanna watch Twin Peaks again with you
She already saw the director's cut on Pay Per View
She's a lipstick anarchist
