Walking down the Mercer St
Been a long hot summer
Rain like daggers coming
Down on me
Get a feeling it's too late
But alone, together, could
Be we might start it up
Allover again
[Chorus]
Dream, dream you're not
Too late
Sweet road to somewhere else
Listen to the radio
Are you calling?
3 o'clock I'm on my way
On the road to somewhere
Little clouds like wounds
That blow away
Listening to the radio like a
Friend that guides me
Playing out every song
We used to know
[Chorus]
Listen to the radio
Are you calling?
[x2]
Bring it on
Come along
On the road to somewhere
Take our time
See the signs
On the road to somewhere

When I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my savior
By the mark where the
Nails have been
[Chorus]
By the mark where the
Nails have been
By the sign upon his precious skin
I will know my savior
When I come to him
By the mark where the
Nails have been
A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the king of heaven
Can be told from the
Prince of fools
[Chorus]
On Calvary's Mountain
Where they made him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago
[Chorus]

I'll take the high road if you ask too
Or buy a pretty house with a naked view
Of the lakeside where we're all alone
Where we can make a life of our very own
You'll be my lifetime hero
I'll be the girl of your dreams
I'll sew our lives at the seams
'Cause I know that...
You belong right here next to me
You belong right here endlessly
I' won't ever let you down
You won't shead a tear
'Cause you belong right here,
Right here with me
I can serve you breakfast on the store
You can kiss me there like you did before
So many lifetimes long ago
We rest assured cause we truly know
That you are my lifetime hero
And I am the girl of your dreams
And we'll sew our lives at the seams
'Cause I know that...

In the coldest hour something's going down
Whatever pierced the heart it didn't make a sound
I am terrified but I'm not losing sleep
If I'm falling then I'm falling at her feet
I'm leaving America, I'm taking a girl
I'm selling my soul again, I'm gaining the world
Every sense defies this impossible dream
None of the history books describe what I've seen
The rose, the breath, the undying spark
The lotus heart's open, embracing the dark
The uncharted road is the not-coming-back
The language I speak is the words that I lack
The oncoming cars, the wedding of stars
Will I know your name or recognise your face
Or by what means I'll be delivered from this place
Here comes the gun, there goes the flash
Once the bullet leaves it's never coming back
The scent of magnolia, the face of a girl
And every detail embodies the world
What kind of goals define this impossible dream
None of the picture-books reflect all I've seen
I'm leaving America, I'm taking the girls
I'll fire from the future and ambush the world
The scent of magnolia, the face of a girl
And every detail embodies the world
What kind of goals define this impossible dream
None of the history books describe where I've been
I'm leaving America, I'm taking a girl
I'll fire from the future and ambush the world

Miles away from light at noon
Total eclipse of the moon
Many reasons to believe in life
Just listen what it's telling you
Come and have a look inside
Total eclipse of the moon
Don't be childish, don't be so cruel
I'm feeling just lonely without
Without you
I can see the wide horizons
But debts have to be paid
Our ways will cross again someday
Believe, and come back to you
I'll see you soon
Time doesn't say hello
Total eclipse of the moon
Many nights in our lives before
I was dreaming to be just beside
Beside you

Why is there you when there are few people around making me feel good?
Why is there me when air is free, some I can see better than I should?
There's only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy.
I think of you ev'ry way, yesterday and today.
I think of things that we do, all the way, ev'ry day.
Stand in the sea, sing songs for me, sing happily, making me feel good.
Watching your eyes, feeling your sighs, saying goodbyes better than I could.
There's only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy.
I think of you every way, yesterday and today.
I think of nothing but you, things we do, things we do.

The lights of the ashes smoulder through hills and vales
Nostalgia burns in the hearts of the strongest
Picasso is painting the ships in the harbour
The wind and sails
These are years with a genius for living
The rope is cut, the rabbit is loose
(fire at will in this open season)
The blood of a poet, the ink in the well
(it's all written down in this age of reason)
The animals run through harvested fields of fire
The bitterness shown on the face of the homeless
Picasso is painting the flames from the houses
The sudden rain
These are years with a genius for living
The rope has been cut, the rabbit is loose
(fire at will in this open season)
The blood of a poet, the ink in the well
(it's all written down in this age of reason)

This heart is breaking.
This heart is breaking.
This heart is breaking.
This heart is breaking.
This heart is breaking.

You know she's never gonna tell you, if she likes it this way
You know she's never gonna ask you, if you feel the same
A fever oh an addiction uh, was it worth it did you give your life away?
A fever a desperate religion, and all that she can say is
Give me just a little bit, uh
Gimme just a little bit
A train that never stops rolling it?s getting into your blood
A need that never stops growing she's a poisonous one
A hope for better days but nothing, oh
Seems to fix it, uh, now you're wasting way
Indeed a desperate religion and all that she will say is

Climbed up
Into the air
Sat down
Onto the blinking blocks of light
Swung my limbs
Under the shadow
Of my dress
The outside is quiet

Time to be done with you
Feels good when I wake in the morning, let the sun come through
I'm not thinking 'bout you
Feeling good when I look in the mirror, my skies are blue
Slept all night for the first time
In months, I'm finally where I wanna be
And all my dreams are coming true
So how does it feel to know, you messed up?
You messed up, you messed up
Bet you feel so stupid that you played with my heart
I don't care to see you, I don't care where you are
I know you didn't think it comes back around, oh
Karma, karma, karma, she's a hell of a girl, oh, oh
You messed up, you messed up, you messed up
All of your friends say you
Hang out all hours of the night 'cause you're so alone
But loving me is overdue
Shoulda done it when you had your chance, now look at you, oh
So how does it feel to know, you messed up?
You messed up, you messed up
Bet you feel so stupid that you played with my heart
I don't care to see you, I don't care where you are
I know you didn't think it comes back around, oh
Karma, karma, karma, she's a hell of a girl, oh
One day here then you're gone
I waited so long to find love on my own
Left when I needed you
That's how they always do
Well baby, so long oh oh
So how does it feel to know, you messed up?
You messed up, you messed up
Bet you feel so stupid that you played with my heart
I don't care to see you, I don't care where you are
I know you didn't think it comes back around, oh
Karma, karma, karma, she's a hell of a girl, oh
It comes back around

Her name was precious jewel
She was the mother I never knew
I got lucky when I met her at 32
She was a dancer in Vegas
The best they&apos;d ever seen
She knew how to work the floor
Like no one had ever done before
She shook her body strong
Raising her legs up long
Hanging from the poles
Starting from her toes
Gyrating up and down
That was precious jewel
The mother I never knew
Working the pole for a dollar a show
Old men leering young boys cheering
She was on fire, every man&apos;s desire
Filling the club every night
She was dynamite
My mother my mother precious jewel
Jewel was just stripping
Trying to make a living
Working long hours
Song by song
Selling her body
All night long my mom always knew
The show must go on
That was precious jewel
The mother I never knew
Extra Vocals:
Using her body to flex
Bend showing off her sexy hot moves
And her electric attitude
She did things that made men lose their minds
Her panties were wet
When she finished a set
A pearl necklace was all that was left
Did you get it?
I am sure you won&apos;t forget it
Did I stutter?
Yes, I am talking about my mother
A sexy ass and a chest for days
Strippers work it in so many ways
Her name was precious jewel
The mother I never knew
Jewel was just stripping
Making a precious living
Working long hours,
Turning men on
Touching herself
Song by song, selling her body
All night long, mom always knew
The show must go on
That was precious jewel
The mother I never knew

Your words stung me to the heart
I hadn't even noticed how far we had drifted apart
can I still count you as a friend
or have I done to much now to ever make amends
cause I once needed just an open mind
well that's no reason why I now should leave you behind
A word from out of the blue
reminds me how much I once needed you
oh but that's all in the past now
so much that I can scarcely remember how
I once needed just a hand to hold
cause now the few times we meet
all I sense is a love grown cold
you can't hold on to everything
and I've forgotten what we talked about a long time since
can't recall days with regret
tomorrow remember today
and all the rest forget
cause time's gone by and all the things we did
are now so much water under another bridge

I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw
It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide
I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw
It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl

Pump the brakes,
You're a red-flag, red light
Holdin' up a stop sign
I'll never be sloppy seconds
Go ahead, take them back,
Your one, two, three minutes
All you do is take, take,
Takin' off the little
Got more goin' on
I'd rather be eating glass,
Stick hot needles in my eyes,
Go ahead and tap that ass
Draw them up,
Yeah like there's candy girl
I ain't tryin'a connect
Or paint a picture
I'm not in it, never will be
You can't be me, get your freak on,
You can suck it, they've all seen it
And you liked it, now who wants it?
Cotton candy sugar high
Break your bones
When you come down
You're a one trick,
My trick pony who's next to hop on
Ride, ride, ride
'Bout to bring a blood spill
We've both been there,
What's the next stop? I won't sit still
Back to bring up what's real
We've both been there
What's the next stop? I won't sit still
Pump the brakes,
You're a red-flag, red light

Back to bring up what's real
We've both been there
What's the next stop? I won't sit still

I close my eyes on the dance floor
I forget about you
I lose myself in flashing colors
I've gotta see it through
You're too much,
I take it that we're over
Should we even care at all?
You're too much, too much
Let's shake hands and say good
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through
Right by my feet, lay broken glasses
You Skeleton Boy
Sweat from the walls, drips on my shoulder
I've got to see it through
You're too much,
I take it that we're over
Should we even care at all?
You're too much, too much
Let's shake hands and say goodbye
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through
Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through

Embracing the goddess' energy within yourselves,
Will bring all of you to a new understanding and value of life.
A vision that inspires you to live and love on Planet Earth.
Like a priceless jewel,
Buried in dark layers of soil and stone.
Earth radiates her brilliant beauty,
Into the caverns of space and time.
Perhaps you are aware of those who watch over your home,
And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality.
You are becoming aware of yourself as a gamemaster.
Imagine Earth restored to her regal beauty.
Stately trees seem to brush the deep blue sky.
Clouds billow to form majestic peaks.
The songs of birds fill the air,
Creating symphony upon symphony.
The goddess is calling for and honoring
Of what she allows to be created
From the core-mystery of the blood.
Those who own her planet are learning about love.

Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fat Lip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon
Today we're gonna teach you some
Fun facts about salmon and a brand new dance
Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip hop star
See, anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, people gang, I'm a show you how
Your hands to the side as silly as it seems
Shake your body like a salmon floating upstream
(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again
All my peeps spend part of their life
In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die
When I first did the salmon all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
"What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap"
But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, "Yo, that nigga's killing it"
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating upstream
(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again
Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow, my family also rely on ocean currents, tides
The gravitational pull of the moon
(I float upstream again)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?
Wow, who knew?
Did you know
What?
That I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me? Amazing, Geez
Polluted water can kill both baby salmon
That are developing and the adult salmon
That are on their way to spawn
Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Hey, kids, hey give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing salmon dance
What ya say? Alright, who's hungry?

Where were you the night I called home?
It felt real strange when no one answered the phone
You told me, you'd never do me wrong, do me wrong
But you can't explain why you stayed out all night long
Was it something I said to you?
What did I do to make you wanna leave?
We tried our best, the very best our love could do
Darling, there's nothing left for me to do
I care, oh, I care for you
Darling, I care for you, oh, I love you
We told each other lies and we always tried
Appealing to the softness just to survive
I'm taking all I'm gonna take from you girl
This love affair is tearing me apart
Oh, you say over and over you're sorry
All the while you're just laughing
It's time for you to leave, yeah
This is not the way I wanted our love to be
Darling I care for you, you know I can't forget you girl no, no
You, you, darling I care for you, I care for you girl
Well you, I care, I can't, can't forget you, girl, no, no no
I really care, yeah, yeah, for you, girl
I think of all the times we spent together, girl
Oh, we had so much fun, yes
You don't know what you meant to me
And how you made me feel
Oh, the pain inside hurts so much girl
You see I wanna say, baby
Can I say, baby?
I love you, no I care

My head is spinnin' so
My feet don't touch the ground
My eyes is blinded by the light
My hearin' deafened by the sound
My body's shakin' like a leaf
My heart's been beatin' out of time
My blood's been boilin' up inside
And I've been fearin' for my life
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't, my feet don't touch the ground
My feet don't touch the ground
My senses reelin'
They been taken by surprise
At how I'm using up time
At how I'm using up my pride
How I've been missin' every sign
Getting all tied up inside

my every joke was funny I had a lot of money
and all the people are fake can't only take
I'm losing my mind and way, need to get away
away from gray and crowded places
city with many faces, my head is about to blow
I need to lay low
minimal, minimal, physical, magical
minimal, minimal, physical, magical
I used to be the man on top
used to be the man on top, couldn't stop
minimal, minimal, physical, magical
my head is about to blow
minimal, minimal, physical, magical
Under the rain I run like a train
feeding my brain, my private lane
they will never find me
I cannot be seen I'm the king of jungle, I will go and win
this is the life I need now I plan to see only myself to feed
I'm the man on top don't wanna stop
my survival is critical
minimal, minimal, physical, magical
minimal, minimal, physical, magical
I need to run away and .
before I go and lose my mind did I lose my mind
did I lose my mind

You can tell it to everybody
There is something between us
You can tell it to everybody
There is something going on between us
You can tell it to everybody
There is something between us
You can tell it to everybody
There is something going on between us

If you only knew I'm sat alone
And if your mamma knew
The things I was doin' to you
You've gotta put the butter on it
Let the coffee stew
Tell me later
What you goin' through
Gimme, gimme lovin'
Mithi, mithi, soft lovin'
So far, you know you've gotta
Let the lovin' flow
From the head
To the toe
If your mamma knew
She'd tell you that we're through
She said that I'm the devil woman
The lady from Hades
So gimme gimme lovin'
Mithi, mithi, soft lovin'

Around the corner a different world
Conversation overheard oh
Between a man and a saxophone
Saxophone and mister drunk and stoned oh
He only knows one melody
You know which one I mean
I drop some change in his hat and leaveâ?¦.
Walk into the corner store
Through neon signs and revolving doors
As if just to add to the atmosphere
The man behind the counter has a snow white beard
That goes all the way down to the floor
I like the music on the radio
You know which one I mean
And this is how it goes
Da da, da da, da da da
Outside on the public phone
There's again mister drunk and stoned
He's got no money but a golden smile
Sidewalk torero wave me by ohhhh
I'm whistling his melody
You know which one I mean
Suddenly he stops playing
And looks at me
And the band goes
Da da, da da, da da da

This is my chance to shout it in other avenue
Say don't you be a sinner, don't you keep all for you, yeah
I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple
Every little dime, every nickel, you are trouble

And give the dog a bone that could never be for you
Nicknamed Fatty Boo but we call her Mel life
Changed forever when she discovered channel
Now she has a mind to buy designer apparel

Whenever she spya something to die for on the fashion channel
(Seventeen breezer, choom)
And one like Tinker Bell, fatty, big like two church bell in parallel
Cats walk and Mel never match up too well
But fatty was saucy, couldn't be told
She loved margo with her big nick, drifling the cold
She even bolder than the skinny girls, shoulder less
(They're mine)
And admired everywhere from her openness
Microphone check one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
Be careful of the things that you do
Say now you got plenty but the plenty could be few
This is my chance to shout it in other avenue
Say don't you be a sinner, don't you keep all for you
Yeah, I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple

Yeah, I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple
Every little dime, every nickel, you are trouble
Watch you're little head, Fatty Boo
And give the dog a bone that could never be for you
Finally Fatty Boo you stood with me in '73
Saturday night playing the music at my father's party
Six records on the changer often with Dan Settee
Still your gram six years old and I'm the man
Steady with calypso to start then play reggae
One thousand bolts of holts, huh, for everybody
In the days when R&B; meant Arthur Conroy
Otis Reading, Booker T and the MG's
Every, little piece of attention as we tried to squeeze
From the father, his friends and their families
Sometime deliberately tease with the tune that won't please
And the whole room reaction set my young heart at ease
It used to be black suits and shirts with skinny ties
And they was wise and funny and funny and wise
Staying up late and playing the music
With grown ups was my prize
The little fat kid with sparkling eyes

Pushing through the storm clouds,
But every time I reach out
My fingers burn, I never learn,
I've been carrying a concrete heart,
Got me worrying there's just no fight
In the dying flame, I need someone to guide the way
That's when you
Sshine a little light
Shine a little light on me,
You, you're burning bright so I can see
Cover me in my hour of need,
In the dark suddenly I feel
You, shine a little light, shine a little light on me
Holding onto old hope,
Don't want to feel my bones grow cynical,
I hear the world,
I've been carrying a concrete heart,
Got me worrying there's just no fight
In the dying flame, I need someone to guide the way
That's when you
Shine a little light
Shine a Little light on me,
You, you're burning bright so I can see
Cover me in my hour of need,
In the dark suddenly I feel
You, shine a little light, shine a little light on me
When I'm bruised and I'm damaged,
When I sink in the sea,
When there's no one to hold onto,
Cover me, ooh
You, shine a little light
Shine a Little light on me,
You, you're burning bright so I can see, I can see,
Cover me in my hour of need,
In the dark suddenly I feel
You, shine a little light, shine a little light on me,
A little light on me,
Shine a little light on me

Left me lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor
Left me, now I'm lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor
Left me, now I'm lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor

You want it out so just take my spawn
Feel complete after it's gone
Don't sleep by my side, sleep on the lawn
It's not too late you wanted it good
Through the hosiery
To the ovaries
To the nothing
How does it feel when you can't feel nothing?
Give that guilt you shed a newborn
To your feet it falls to the floor
Itching inside you still want more
Stillborn fawn throw it to the door
Through the hosiery
To the ovaries
To the nothing
How does it feel when you can't feel nothing?
Fifteen years you've waited for me
Through preteen years of deficiency
Cuts on my hands, but you can't feel nothing
Blood on my hands, you can wipe up something
Drink sulfur, spill it in my lap
My onus is the time that you lack
Borrowed your womb you can't have it back
Drink sulfur, spit it right back
Fifteen years you've waited for me
Through preteen years of deficiency
Cuts on my hands, but you can't feel nothing
Blood on my hands, you can wipe up something

Herr God, herr Lucifer
Out of the ashes I rise
The end of my century's sundown
burnt into my eyes
Backward thinking didn't get me
where I am today
I been dreamin' of freezing my mind
in Californi-I-A
Hey Cyberchrist cardiac-hero
From the ashes I ride
We know the meaning of life
It's in the scream
of my bottleneck-slide
Backward thinking didn't get me
where I am today
Get a Harley, get a hard on
Get a ride out of the U.S. of A.
Staring at the sun
Waiting for my time to come
Millennium Fever
Millennium Fever
What are you doing after the orgy?

You kissed my head as you stood in the door
And then you said: "don't want to see you no more"
All I could say as you walked out on me
Was how I hoped you'd remembered your key
Took one last look
Took the phone of the hook
I must confess I agree
All o those days when I went through a phase
Of missing the love that you bore
In retrospect there's something I can't neglect
I was missing a love but not yours
The love that you bore that thing that I once adored
Was no gift that you gave me each time
Thinking again, what a fool I was then
It was a trophy of yours and a burden of mine

When I've done my work of day
And I row my boat away
Doon the waters o' Loch Tay
As the evening light is fading
And I look up on Ben Law'rs
Where the afterglory glows
And I think on two bright eyes
And the melting mouth below
She's my beauteous nighean rue
She's my joy, my sorrow too
And although she is untrue
Well I cannot live without her
For my heart's a boat in tow
And I'd give the world to know
Why she means to let me go
As I sing horee, horo
Nighean Ruadh, your lovely hair
Has more glamour I declare
Than all the tresses rare
'Tween Killin and Aberfeldy
Be they lint white, brown or gold
Be they blacker than the sloe
They are worth no more to me
Than the melting flake o' snow
Her eyes are like the gleam
O' the sunlight on the stream
And the song the fairies sing
Seems like songs she sings at milking
But my heart is full of woe
For last night she bade me go
And the tears begin to flow
As I sing horee, horo.

You always want me to be a part of you
You always taught me to be alive with you
This is the time and the place and the moment
Feeling the way that I do
These are the signs and the traces of growing
By living the way that I do
I hope you understand and acknowledge
All that's passing through
It's constantly been there and
throwing all that wasn't good
I hope we both find the place
Where maybe some day we will find our strength
And hopefully attain to finally escape
I'm always amazed how we're so self destructive
Does any body know why?
Find the light

It will shine and it will shudder
As i guide it with my rudder
On its metaled ways
It will cut the night before it
As it leaves the day that saw it
On its metaled ways
Nobody passes us in the deep quiet of the dark sky
Nobody sees us alone out here among the stars
In these metal ways
In these metal days.
Through a fault of our designing
We are lost among the windings
Of these metal ways
Back to silence back to minus
With the purple sky behind us
In these metal ways
Nobody hears us when we're alone in the blue future
No one receiving the radio's splintered waves
In these metal ways
In these metal days.

Inner city sky rise over town at night
You pushed me to the top floor
So we could see the sights
I could tell that you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool
I push out, I breathe in
A stillness turning away
Don't look back, don't pretend
We'll never take control again
We're falling beyond the horizon
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away
On the poolside staring into glowing blue
Swimsuit issues with my toes
Curled in the grooves
I could tell that you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool
I push out, I breathe in
A stillness turning away
Don't look back, don't pretend
We'll never take control again
And before that we own the horizon
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away
Keep breathing, keep searching, keep holding on
Keep breathing, keep living, keep holding on
I push out, I breathe in
A stillness turning away
Don't look back, don't pretend
We'll never take control again
And before that we own the horizon
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away

Now we're in twin cities, where the Mississippi rises and then falls.
One is Minneapolis, the other though less famous, is St. Paul.
There are stray dogs on the highway and the local farmers moan about lack of rain.
When the winds blew last winter I'd swear England had another hurricane.
And we are twin cities and we are that river.
From the standing still, we will be delivered.
The last time in new york was with Mandela and Madonna and the Mets.
For icons of an era, well, that's about as famous as it gets.
I've seen cities full of ticker tape and cotton trains through Utah disappearing out of sight.
And now I'm standing in a city that's as pretty as an ocean in the night.
And we are twin cities and we are that ocean. from the standing still, we are set in motion.
And no one calls me up to say, "how long are you going to be away?"
No one calls me up to say, "don't let that life lead you astray"
They were rioting in Detroit on the night the pistons won it back to back.
I was out of there the next day and I only had just two bags to pack.
And we are twin cities and we are one river.

Follow me, come and feel infinity, eternity
Follow me, toi et moi, deja, deja vu
Follow me, come and feel infinity, eternity
Follow me, toi et moi, deja, deja vu
Follow me, come and feel infinity, eternity
Follow me, toi et moi, deja, deja vu

We all return to change
We all have time to change
We swim against the tide
Look back into the past
We all do anything
We live in unconditional change
A call to all
A call to us
A call to everything you wanted
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
A call to all
A call to us
A call to everything you wanted
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life

Why did you leave that message on my phone
Was it from your head? Cause I don't what I done to earn it
You could be right here, but would say what you mean or would you wait until I'm gone and you are lonely and you blame me for never understanding
And if this house was on fire would you tell me your desire
If my hands were round your throat would you tell me what I need to know
There must be some way, some way through this
If the sky was falling down would I see behind that frown
If cold steel touched your skin would you finally stop and let me in
Tell me baby how to get through this
And I done my time in the firing line
And I paid my dues hanging from a noose
And I'll do whatever it takes to put a smile upon your face
I will do whatever it takes, I will do whatever it takes
If my hands were round your throat would you tell me what I need to know
There's got to be some way, some way through this
If the sky was falling down would I see behind that frown
If cold steel touched your skin would you finally stop and let me in
Tell me baby how to get through this

eye catcher
maybe it was a vista
ma te lho detto colto impossibile divino
i followed him around
i thought they never existed
ognuno hat mal nella vita una voce di bambina
he said:
it's not my fault
i'm a nouveau americain
i'm a nouveau americain
he's a nouveau americain
As good as gold
i saw another one from a distance
there was a ribbon in my hair
und meine sonne und mein mond am himmel
wie wunderbar i thought
but then there's zero resistance
ognuno hat mal nella vita un momento di follia
he said:
it's not my fault
i'm a nouveau americain
i'm a nouveau americain
he's a nouveau americain
so he said
eye catcher
it is a matter of gusto
la nuit est jeune so soll es sein
y cada vez un poco mas y cada vez un poco mas
the last one to laugh will not be driving a mustang
ognuno hat mal nella vita il momento di poesia
he said:
it's not my fault
i'm a nouveau americain
i'm a nouveau americain
yes a nouveau americain.
he's a nouveau americain

It's tricky when you feel someone
Has done some sin on your behalf
It's slippery when your sense of justice
Murmurs underneath and is asking you
How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right
With a palm full of stars
I throw them like dice (repeatedly)
On the table (repeat, repeatedly)
I shake them like dice
And throw them on the table repeatedly (repeatedly)
Until the desired constellation appears
How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right
(And did you hear how am I going to make it right)

I see you can you see I
Paper thin made of neon
Weekend come I gotta see you
Take your time and consider
Don't be down I'll make you better
Got the back to the letter
Meet me down by the river
Lay me down and pull the trigger
Ultra obscene - ah -
You and me - ah -
Skin on skin - ah -
Uh, uh, uh
Ultra obscene

Here we come, driving down
Deep and wide, settle down
On the beach, get the sun
Coming down, wet and warm
[??]
I want to waste it playing
Spend all our day in a dream
Crystalline green watch it rolling
Feeling the weight of the sun
Here we come, blue and green
Breathing in, come alive
Here we come, with the stars

Traces, many faces
Lost in the maze of time
Blinded by the darkness

Oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
Ooh ooh
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me

The first is the father
The second is the mother
And the third is the child

Now shut up and listen
This is not a habitude
This is an empty sound
But don't loose faith
Let me present the 'Beat'
This is not a habitude
This is an empty sound
If groove coverage is day, this is night
Here comes the pure evil
Yeah!
Here we go
Do you like it?
Get ready for more
Yeah!

So do, I warn you
I see things when I hold you
But I've whispered: "it's alright"
It is you and me and a long night
You're a ghost in the doorway,
I can see through, but I hold tight,
I'll just stay on holding until it hurts,
I just want you to know your lovely,
You're a ghost in the doorway,
I can see through, but I hold tight,
I'll just stay on holding until it hurts,
I just want you to know your lovely,
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong,

Don't worry, nothing can go wrong,
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong,
(nothing!!)

I am in her room
It's I who live here now
I don't know how I got here
There's this man who comes every night
And hour passes
Then i another
Smoking slowly
Her death
Was she already dead
When i came ?
I mean enought to bury
I am in her room
It's I who live here now
I don't know how I got here
There's this man who comes every night

If you ever feel the time to drop me a loving line
maybe you should just think twice
I don't wait around on your advice
You tell me I can go this far, but no more
Try to show me heaven and then slam the door
You offer shelter at a price much too dear
And your kind of love's the kind that soon disappears
So don't brag how you have changed
And everything's been rearranged
I thought all that was over and done
But I still get the same from Each and Everyone
Being kind is just a way to keep me under your thumb
and I can cry because that's something we've always done
you tell me I'm free of the past now and all those lies
then offer me the same thing in a different guise

Here it is:
Bang! Another dope jam!
Get up of your bud and start to dance
Come on do your stuff don't hazetate

You've been selected by the gods
She told me

(Looking for trouble? Have you got it?)
What a man has to go through for a piece of ass in a modern age it was highly ridiculous
Oh babe

Yes, the tears of the gods!

Freeze! I said freeze! Stop moving!
Freeze! I said freeze! Stop moving until I kill you...
You don't scare me! (x3)
I said you don't scare me!
You don't scare me! (x4)
You think you can look down on me
Pointing your fucking gun at me
With your fucking magazine!
But yeah we both what we gonna do...
When you come down
We'll fuck you to the ground!
The feeling everything will be wiped away
And even if you dig a fainted society...
Marching along representing what you do
I'd rather crush my head in and
Fuck your rules!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Your uniform does not impress me...
Cast my shadow, break my mind
Cut my tongue and you'll see
What you'll find!
I don't fear the truth anymore!
I won't believe the police
Forcing shit on me!
You're like a parasite!
I was born at the end of disruption...
Your corrupted smile
I don't take it anymore! I never did!
Fuck you! Wait when we come for you!
The soulless suppression!
Protect the peace, oh yeah, ya gun piece!
Fuck you gangsta's
With uniforms and dumb beast
Throw me on the wall slowly we brawl
Know me not at all - Stop!
Show me who fall it's me and ya'll
Hold me on the floor - What!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Your technology never scared me!
Your uniform does not impress me!
Disconnected, lost and I don't feel free
I walked through the streets of death
Suppression's coming at me
I won't detect the fact
That I couldn't choose from
Just another totalitarian regime!
I perform human's history as a pose
Supposed to be... That's how it goes
My future died years ago
A digital concentration camp - That's how I feel!
You don't impress me - Fucker!
What you want? Scare me? Fuck you!
Your uniform does not impress me! (x3)
Your uniform does not impress me at all!
Your uniform does not impress me! (x3)
You don't scare me! You don't scare me! (x3)
Why you looking at me? What did I do?
Is there a problem that you have here with my crew?
I never did nothing to your family
So why you mad at me?
Is it because I don't treat you like my majesty?
Why you looking at me? What did I do?
Is there a problem that you have with my Arsonist's crew?
Do you want me to kill your family?
Then don't be mad at me
Is it because I don't treat you like my fucking majesty?
Or that I ain't quiet pissed off cause
We don't buy it - Don't try it!
Don't try it you'll die quick mutha...

Winter Kills
Green, in your love
On bright days
You grew sun blind
You thought me unkind
To remind you
How winter kills
Lost in daydreams
You drove too fast
And got nowhere
You rode on half fare
When you got too scared
How winter kills
Tear at me searching for weaker seams
Pain, in your eyes
Makes me cruel
Makes me spiteful
Tears are delightful
Welcome your nightfall
How winter kills
I'll tear at you searching for weaker seams
How winter kills, how winter kills [Repeat: x6]

People hate people for nothing at all
our kingdon of love is ready to fall
hate is the power which keeps them going on
it's their motivation - but their feelings are gone
chorus:
Just war - pride and resignation
Pure war - hate and resolution
Just war - a deadly combination
Pure war - but this is their solution
Hate and war - from all sides of the earth
Nuclear power - i call it evil's birth

And I know
You know
It should be me
That's holding you
And I know that pride
Collides with beauty
And I know
You know
It should be me
That's touching you
And I know that pride
Collides with beauty
I'm upside down
And inside out
The room's not big enough
I'm waiting for your love
Been waiting for your love
Gone round and round
Half falling down
The floor's not flat enough
I'm waiting for your love
Been waiting for your love
Chorus:
And I know
You know
It should be me
That's holding you
And I know that pride
Collides with beauty
And I know
You know
It should be me
That's touching you
And I know that pride
Collides with beauty
And I know
You know
It should be me
That's holding you
And I know that pride
Collides with beauty
And I know
You know
It should be me
That's loving you
And I know that pride
Collides with beauty
It's too much
It's not enough
The walls can't hold me up
I'm waiting for your love
Been waiting for your love
I'm back and forth
And forth and back
The window's fogging up
I'm waiting for your love
Been waiting for your love

Up on a hill, as the day dissolves
With my pencil turning moments into line
High above in the violet sky
A silent silver plane - it draws a golden chain
One by one, all the stars appear
As the great winds of the planet spiral in
Spinning away, like the night sky at Arles
In the million insect storm, the constellations form
On a hill, under a raven sky
I have no idea exactly what I've drawn
Some kind of change, some kind of spinning away
With every single line moving further out in time
And now as the pale moon rides (in the stars)
Her form in my pale blue lines (in the stars)
And there, as the world rolls round (in the stars)
I draw, but the lines move round (in the stars)
There, as the great wheels blaze (in the stars)
I draw, but my drawing fades (in the stars)
And now, as the old sun dies (in the stars)
I draw, and the four winds sigh (in the stars)

Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else
You steam our unstable eyes and glass
Not get passed off through my bird lips as good news
Still we can find our love down from behind
Down far behind this fabulous, my turn rules
Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and then blues
Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else
You steam our unstable eyes and glass
Not get passed off through my bird lips as good news
You'll have the hardest black and dullest knife
We hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasty
Still being cried and laughed at before
Should I be sewn in hugged I can by not saying
Still being cried and laughed at from light to blue
And should I be hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque
And should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
You mind not saying
He'll have the hardest black and dullest ignite
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
We hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
Should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
Hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for key

This is the story of a country girl
Back in town from her country house
She came to me with her muddy boots
She destroyed all my carpet
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
You never wear cosmetic
You don't like arithmetic
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
Tasting,touching,swallowing me
Drinking me like bloody Mary
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
You don't wear cosmetic
You don't like arithmetic
You know how to do it
Wonder milky bitch
Tasting,touching,swallowing me
Drinking me like bloody Mary
Wonder milky bitch
Wonder milky bitch
Wonder milky bitch

No time for time
No time beat
Two days to go before we meet
Done it's done oh down on me
You didn't come so don't be guilty
All this charm is wearing thin
The maniac loose and she's wearing my skin
Here's to another crap weekend
You lie to yourself and you shit on all your friends
With no surprise
Remove it all and there I am
Hopeless and peeled in the baking sun
Oh young fish I'll fight anything that passes by
Half a mind to tell you
I want the rain to fall and clean you
I want the stars to fall forget it all
And drown beside you
No pupils no disguise
No pupils no disguise
Gently in the slime drain
Wear a coat if it looks like rain
You said you'd come, you'd come alone
But the hours wore on and I got numb
Smiley monsters fill my head
Toothless sharks swim around my bed
I brick em up but leave them air
'cause seriously I'm not happy when they're not there
How hard is your heart? my sledgehammer
Will split you apart, my sledgehammer
Sweet sweat hairs wet you ain't even sure who she is yet
Sweet sweat hairs wet you ain't even sure who she is yet
How hard is your heart? my sledgehammer
Will split you apart, my sledgehammer
How hard is your heart? my sledgehammer
Will split you apart, my sledgehammer
Watch pieces of the ones you love fall off over time
Greedy in your sickness and your sugar and wine
On the one hand you put your arm out to the candy man in the van
In a perfect world yeah you can stand where I can stand.
Time for breaks
Ok take it away

I still love when I'm caught in every beat of your heart
I still love when it's dark and you're not alone
I still want you, I'll hold you every step of the way
I'm still yours 'til the end, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love when I'm caught in every beat of your heart
I still love when it's dark and you're not alone
I still want you, I'll hold you every step of the way
I'm still yours 'til the end
I still love when I'm caught in every beat of your heart
I still love when it's dark and you're not alone
I still want you, I'll hold in every tear that I cry
I'm still yours 'til the end
My life is a mystery but I cannot run from my destiny
Oh babe, I just wanna let you know
I still love when I'm caught in every beat of your heart
I still love when it's dark and you're not alone
I still want you, I'll hold you every step of the way
I'm still yours 'til the end
I still love when I'm caught in every beat of your heart
I still love when it's dark and you're not alone
I still want you, I'll hold you every step of the way
I'm still yours 'til the end
I still love when I'm caught in every beat of your heart
I still love when it's dark and you're not alone
I still want you, I'll hold in every tear that I cry
I'm still yours 'til the end
I still love

With watching eyes
You see dreams dissolving
Distant voices slipping away
I have to go - I hear
The call of something deeper
A voice inside of me
And tears return
Beneath the happy ending
Promised words that scattered
In the cold
I have to leave, I hear
The call of something higher
Something young becoming old
I can't stay here any longer
Trapped here by the rain
I can't stay here any longer
Waiting for this train
I'm waiting for the last train
Out of nowhere
I'm waiting for the last train
On the line
Some people say that I will
Never leave here..
But I have to go this time
I'm waiting for the last train
Bound for somewhere
I'm playing with my last chance
On the line
I think it's really now or never
You know I have to try...
My sympathies,
Are wasted on regretting
Why not come with me?
I have to go - I hear
The call of something stronger
And it's pulling me away
I can't stay here any longer
Trapped here by the rain
I can't stay here any longer
Waiting for this train
I'm waiting for the last train
Out of nowhere
I'm waiting for the last train
On the line
Some people say that I will
Never leave here..
But I have to go this time
I'm waiting for the last train
Bound for somewhere
I'm playing with my last chance
On the line
I think it's really now or never
You know I have to try...
I've been running around in circles
Without any direction
I've been searching hard to find
Who I really am..
I've been running around in circles
Without any direction
I've been lost here for so long
I've forgotten who I am..
I'm waiting for the last train
Out of nowhere
I'm waiting for the last train
On the line
Some people say that I will
Never leave here..
But I have to go this time
I'm waiting for the last train
Bound for somewhere
I'm playing with my last chance
On the line
I think it's really now or never
You know I have to try...

I watch the sun go down and up again and think of you.
You're just too busy seeing red when all I see is blue.
I'm sorry, baby, for what I did to you.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry, baby.
I don't wanna hear a love song.
I don't wanna hear a love song.
I watch the sun go down and up again and think of you.
You're just too busy seeing red when all I see is blue.
I'm sorry, baby, for what I did to you.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm in the night and faint so long I'm thought as lost and gone.
So, just speed up, slow down,
It's time to go and this I know.

Lines to the skin
That have seen
Neither sun nor sin
Tubes to the mouth
Cannot laugh or sigh
Or even cry
A drop in the ocean
A second and all time
One stop in the endless sky
But you mean
The whole world to me
You're an island of light
So please last this day
Stay one more day
Please last this day
Stay one more day
Stay one more
Stay one more
Stay one more day
Just one more
Just one more
Just one more day
All this madness around us
You are knowing
And so still
You were made in love
Grew in hope
Were born in pain
You have them running round
Trying to make you breath again
One tiny link
In and endless chain
But you mean
The whole world to me
You're an island of light
So please last this day
Stay one more day
Please last this day
Stay one more day
Please last this day
Stay one more day

Always brave and pert
Sunday sun your up
Your wild lies
Always start
With wide, white lines
Summer shine

We should get together
We should get together
Take anything you want boy cause you know that
There won't be a second time
Take everything you can girl
Cause a love like this
So real is hard to find
[Bridge]
Take anything you want
Take everything you need
Cause it's time for understanding
If a love is in your heart
Then it's really time to start
And I've got to let you know
[Chorus]
We should get together
Stay this way forever
Echos in my mind
You and me combined
We should get together
want to last forever
Taking back what's mine
Love is gonna shine
[Chorus]
We should get together
(Gonna shine) [Repeat: x3]
We should get together
(Gonna shine) [Repeat: x3]
Just think about the last night
Cause the future is a light
That shines for you
Don't worry 'bout the answers
Holding on to what you've got
Is all you should do
[Bridge]
[Chorus: x2]
We should get together
(Gonna shine) [Repeat: x3]
We should get together
(Gonna shine) [Repeat: x3]
[Repeat: x2
Take it or leave it
You gotta believe it
Take it or leave it
It's all up to you
[Chorus: x2]
[Repeat: x2]
We should get together
(Gonna shine) [Repeat: x3]
We should get together
(Gonna shine) [Repeat: x3]

Da da da da...
Guy:
I remember all the days
Remember all the ways
The ways you made me feel...
With you, I never had to hide
With you right by my side
I never even tried...
Girl:
I had to go for something more
The times we had
Was no way to an open door(?)
I had to break up with you
Cause there's so many things and so much I must do
But one day(?)
You could always make me smile
Keep me warm and make me wild
I had to go
I miss you so
But whatever that youll do,
And whatever that youll say
I will always remember you
Guy:
I thought everything was fine
I thought that you were mine
Until you drew the line
Girl:
And I just had to feel more free
I need more privacy
Its for the best you see (?)
You could always make me smile
Keep me warm and make me wild
I had to go
I miss you so
But whatever that youll do,
And whatever that youll say
I will always remember you
Bridge:
Do you remember September?
(What was so great I could not say)
You stood there by my side
I never tried to run or hide
Do you remember December?
(It just a day I went away)
I thought that you were mine
That it was fine you drew the line
Da, da da da, da da da, da da da...
Da, da da da, da da da, da da da...

I've been fragile for a long time
A big old hole inside my heart
And I was searching through the valley
Stumbled on love in the dark
Was afraid to try but afraid to never know
What it feels like to be loved
Had a hill to climb
But the places we could go
Oh, I gotta know
So if we ever, fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
So if we ever, fell in love
Oh, oh, oh
I was empty, it was all gone
The birds would sing but made no sound
Till I met you, found I was all wrong
You picked me up right off the ground
Was afraid to try, and afraid I'd fall again
Crashing down from the sky, you know
Had a hill to climb, but with you my heart wont mend
That's the one thing, we all wanna know
So if we ever, fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
(Yeah) So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, I wanna know what it feels like to be loved

I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear
There something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
There something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear
There something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
There something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
There something inside you (there's something inside you)
It's hard to explain (it's hard to explain )
They're talking about you boy (they're talking about you boy)
But you're still the same

verse 1
i don't believe we were put together not to be together
and i don't believe theres anyone out there that can love me better
i don't believe that you know how much i miss seeing your pretty smile.
of course we had our ups and downs
but i gotta have you around me cuz...
chorus
i feel it all over my body
i dream about you when i sleep
you're the one for me(you're the one)
you're the one for me(you're the one)
all the signs say that
ever since the day that we laid eyes on each other baby
you're the one for me(you're the one)
you're the one for me(you're the one)
verse 2
i don't believe that you know how much i melt every time i smell your scent boy
and i don't believe (i don't believe) i got myself in this predicament
im sorry(im so sorry)
for everything i ever did wrong
im sorry(im so sorry)
and im begging you begging you begging you begging you please come back home
chorus
when i lay in my bed at night
im hoping and praying that you feel the same way i do deep down inside(inside)
and the feeling you just cant control
it makes you wanna just call me
and tell me how much you really miss me
it makes you wanna call me.
and say that you just cant wait
to hold and kiss me kiss me ALL OVER!! HEEYYYYY!!
chorus

Pa-party, we are the professional party people.
Make some noise!
Here we go!
4, 3, 2, 1
Pa-party, we are the professional party people.

Sleeping beauty
Where have you been
You should know
I'm counting on you here
Feels like clouds beneath your wings
It is night, you see it as it is
It is dark, have mercy on us all
You should know
I'm counting on you here
His kiss
His kiss
His kiss
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss...
Let's talk about the weather
And the snow
Falling from the heavens like crystal feather
The power of the powder
The silence screams louder
I feel cold
This is a nation on hold
It's the chill
Without the thrill
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
Come to my kingdom
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
Come to my kingdom
I manage to get down to the coffee shop
It's the big freeze, I feel like a pork chop
Jesus it's cold, must be a million below
Nowhere to go, and the snow still falling
Everything's gone white
Still nothing looks bright
There's no signs of daylight
Every day is like an eternal night
I'm out of here soon
I might be back in June
It's the chill
Without the thrill
It's the chill
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
Come to my kingdom
His kiss
His kiss
His kiss
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
Spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss
It's the chill
Without the thrill
It's the chill
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
You should know
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
I'm counting on you here
His kiss of spring
His kiss
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
His kiss of spring
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
His kiss of spring
It's the chill
Without the thrill
I'm waiting for spring to come to my kingdom
To my kingdom

I am on an open sea
Just drifting as the hours go slowly by
Julie with her open blouse
Is gazing up into the empty sky.
Now it seems to be so strange here
Now it's so blue
The still sea is darker than before...
No wind disturbs our coloured sail
The radio is silent, so are we
Julie's head is on her arm
Her fingers brush the surface of the sea.
Now i wonder if we'll be seen here
Or if time has left us all alone
The still sea is darker than before...

Oh I wish I could be
Touched by the hem of his garment
To be proud has
Never been
So mean, so hard, so stern, so cruel
Oh I wish I could be
Touched by the hem of his garment
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Touch the hem of his garment
And anger should be
The tool of a clown, or a fool you see
Why should spite and such pain
Hang between you and me
When love should be
The queen on her thrown looking after own
Wish I could be
Touched by the hem of his garment
Two chairs
This table
One bed
In this house
Seriously
I think we could be, feel we could be
Touched by the hem of his garment
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Mmmm mmmm I've come a long way
Touch the hem of his garment

Got more knowledge, than you can get from the internet

If you want some, come and get some

Almost blue, almost doing things we used to do
There's a boy here and he's almost you
Almost all the things that your eyes once promised
I see in his too, now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue, flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue, it's almost touching, it will almost do
There is a part of me that's always true, always
Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few
I've seen such an unhappy couple
Almost me, almost you, almost blue

( Live MCM Caf )
I'm on my way to end it all
It's driving my mad
My eyes are dry, My mind is gray
Nothing inside
Comming to see you
I'm on my way
I'm on my way to end it all
It's driving my mad
My eyes are dry, My mind is gray
Nothing inside
Comming to see you
I'm on my way
My eyes are dry, My mind is gray
Nothing inside
An empty mind, With empty eyes
Look at me now
I'm on my way
I'm on my
I'm on my way
I'm on my
On my way
On my way

If I can't be a man, tell me what I am?
Tell me what I'm here for?
If I can't be the one, tell her what I've done
What good can I be?
Did I not do enough to save the two of us?
What more could I give her?
What more could I do to see her point of view?
Why can't I believe her?
You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, oh
Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
Oh, oh
You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, oh
Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
You can't come
Oh, oh

Time to go
It's time to go
Whatever this means
He's happy it seems
After night
In boundless light
He calls my name
I do the same
After this
A simple kiss
Return my eyes
A true disguise
(Echo) After this
A simple kiss
Return my eyes
A true disguise
So I'll be a fleeting sound
A lightray out on the water
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the night time
tell him about the night time
tell him about the night time
tell him about the night time
Time to go
It's time to go
Whatever this means
He's happy it seems
After night
In boundless light
He calls my name
I do the same
So I'll be a fleeting sound
A lightray out on the water
And I'll know his secret name
And tell him about the night time
tell him about the night time
tell him about the night time
tell him about the night time

You are a star
You wear it well
You blow my mind tonight
So we can dance all night

You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you

Open up your heart, what do you feel
Open up your heart, what do you feel, is real
The big bang may be a million years away
But I can't think of a better time to say
World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
Look inside, you'll find a deeper love
The kind that only comes from high above
If you ever meet your inner child, don't cry
Tell them everything is gonna be alright
World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
Children of the sky, alright
Don't take no for an answer, no no, alright
Right here, spread love, everybody join together now
One race, one heart, love and unity, everybody sing
yeah!
World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
Open up your heart, what do you feel
Open up your heart, what do you feel, is real

Let me tell you about this torch I carry
It's not much of a career
And it won't make my fortune I fear
But it stays alight and won't be buried
It's brighter year-by-year
And someday it will surely disappear
When it does I'll know I've laid to rest
The ghost of your unhappiness
That flits around from room to room
A widow on a honeymoon
A shadow on a harvest moon
So put away this torch you carry
For it's doing you no good
And surely you know by now that you should
And come the day you die or marry
Will you be understood
When you say that you wanted but never could
Turn your back and lay to rest
The ghost of your unhappiness
That flits around from room to room
A widow on a honey moon
A shadow on a harvest moon
I write these words to make them true,
"I've drowned my torch and so should you."

Can you make me feel better?
Tell me what to do
Tell me, tell me i wanna feel like you
Are you happy
You look so satisfied
Show me show me show me
I wanna know what it s like
Ahh ahh ahh
.you can .
Like everything so civilized
Chorus:
Make me up and make me over
Make me higher, make me sober
Tell me tell me tell me what to do
Make me up and make me over
Make me higher, make me sober
Tell me tell me tell me i wanna feel like you
I don t understand a word just say
And maybe maybe maybe I m just crazy
Don t make me all a trouble that i need
Ahh ah, ahh ahh
Message can you .
Make everything so secret loss
Chorus:
Make me up and make me over
Make me higher, make me sober
Tell me tell me tell me what to do
Make me up and make me over
Make me higher, make me sober
Tell me tell me tell me i wanna feel like you
Up the floor boys lady there
Struck the walls and face the chair
Touch my skin is so disguised
Close my lips shut my eyes
[Chorus:]

I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstactically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly won your game
Oh yeah, you said that I have
Been gone too long
Don't try to tell me
That I was wrong (re-e-mix)
Totally, wrong for me
Got the hurt in my face
Now I know the only thing to do
Is to give myself some space
I bet she never told you everything that drifted through her mind
All the secret thoughts
Well I bet you never caught her sliding with another man
Because I did
No no, I hate to see the way the finger points at me
I'm at fault, I don't think so
After all is said and done girl
You know you've had your fun
Why don't you leave it there
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstactically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you'd nearly won your game
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstactically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly won your game
Oh yeah
You say you had a girl, with problems
Tell me, did it lead to heartache and confusion? (re-e-mix)
Did you wake up in tears
Not knowing where you are?
Did you, get it in the ear, like I did?
Like I did
I bet she never told you everything that drifted through her mind
All the secret thoughts
Well I bet you never caught her sliding with another man
Because I did
No no, I hate to see the way the finger points at me
I'm at fault, I don't think so
After all is said and done girl
You know you've had your fun
Why don't you leave it there
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstactically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you'd nearly won your game
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstactically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly won your game

No, I can't see tomorrow when I close my eyes
There is no tomorrow, my gift is of no use
What's the horse on the shore waiting for?
See, today wears a mask, today is a shadow
Today is meant to drag down, shelter and devour
Today is a gift fading beforehand
Today is a feast ending too early
Break: Albeit unseen, albeit unveiled
There's a troublemaker
Hiding heavy secrets

Travessia
Quando voc foi embora
Fez-se noite em meu viver
Forte eu sou mas no tem jeito
Hoje eu tenho que chorar
Minha casa no minha
E nem meu este lugar
Estou s e no resisto
Muito tenho pr falar
Solto a voz nas estradas
J no quero parar
Meu caminho de pedras
Como posso sonhar
Sonho feito de brisa
Vento vem terminar
Vou fechar o meu pranto
Vou querer me matar
Vou seguindo pela vida
Me esquecendo de voc
Eu no quero mais a morte
Tenho muito que viver
Vou querer amar de novo
E se no der no vou sofrer
J no sonho
hoje fao com meu brao o meu viver
(English translation:)
Crossing
When you were gone
There was nigth in my life
I'm strong but there's no way
Today I have to cry
My house is not mine
And even mine is this place
I'm alone and don't resist
Much I have to tell
(I let go my voice on the roads
Now I don't want to stop
(My route is made of stone
How can I dream
Dream made of breeze
Wind come finish
I'll close my weeping
I'll want to kill myself
I'll following by the life
Forgeting about you
I don't want death anymore
I have lot to live
I'll want to love again
And if doesn't work I'll not be hurt
I don't dream
Today I make with my arms my subsist

( saul williams featuring esthero )
Esthero :
Oh ahhhh oooh
Saul williams :
Children of this night
Only same will star the sky
Only believers in death will die
And fathers must feather the wings of women
For the unfeathered masses dangle ridiculous
Carrying crosses to phalayx filled tombs
The future sails silence through blood rivered wombs
That ripple with riddles of cows and spoons and births
Moons and earths
Sun-centered at noon
Esthero :
Now....
Saul williams :
And here I stand
Court jestering infinity
Fetal fisted for revolution
But open hands birth humility
Now what you the density of an egoless planet?
Must my spine be aligned to sprout wings?
I'm slouched into sling steps and kangoled with gang reps
But my orbit rainbows saturn rings
Mystical eliptical
Presto polaris
Karmic flamed future when saturns and aries
And not I'm a fish called father
With gills type dizzy
Blowing liquid lullabies through the spine of time
I'm certain of saturns rivers and all esle is fact
So baptise me in the stars
And wrap me in nighttime
Moon blue
Pupil my sight with orange balls of light
And echo my plight
Through the corridors of metaphor
What else are we living for if not to create
Fiction and rhyme?
My purpose is to make my soul
Rhyme with my mind
Mind over matter
Minds create matter
Minds create fiction
As a matter of fact
As if matter were fact
Matter is fact
So spirit much be fiction
Science fiction
Art fiction meta fiction
Esthero :
Now
Saul williams :
The tao of now
Is here amongst the living in the voice of children is the tao of now
Esthero :
You are the divine reflection of this earth
She does not belong to you
No there is no need for your correction
All run in the same rivers
Saul williams :
All rivers run in the same direction
If you're serving the father theres no sun w/o matter
Parent bodies discover water
Bodies and drown
Wade me in the water
'til atlantis is found
On the sea floors of self
I'm starfish and unbound
Heard the way of that mound is stone mountain
Underwater volcanoes erupt water fountains of youth
Test this carnal equation cancel out wind and truth
Swirl me beyond sometimes
Drench me water proof
Let eve drop forever rain
Sunsets on my roof
As I sit on the front porch of my sanity
Deciphering hambones to van gogh this vanity
Oiled egos
Canvased and framed
To be reborn unborn unburied unnamed
A reflection through a blood stained glass window
Or souls
Esthero :
There is a monster living
It's the voice of children
It is the tao of now
Saul williams :
Gone yellow round the edges
Carbonated dreams and blurred daily lives
But let family bring focus
Out of swamps blossom lotus
The muddy water blue daughter of infinity
Gravity we water bodied bhodisativas our serenity
As we rise with the tides toward divinity
Esthero :
Now...
There is a monster living it's in the voice of children
It is the tao of now
Saul williams :
Yes we rise with the tides towards divinity
The muddy water blue daughter of infinity
Gravity we water bodied bhodisativas our serenity
As we rise with the tides toward divinity....
Yes we rise with the tides towards diviinty
Now we rise with the tides towards divinity
'cause we rise with the tides towards divinity
Esthero :
Now...
Saul williams :
The tao of now
Is here amongst the living in the voice of children is the tao of now
Esthero :
There is a monster living it's in the voice of children
It is the tao of now

There's no use fighting
I try to remain Unappalled
There's no use fighting
It leaves me provisionally quiet and cold
A sinking feeling
Is swiftly growing
I didn't have the least inkling
Of the plot they were weaving

I don't want to be with anybody at all
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
I don't want to be with anybody at all
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
I don't want to be with anybody at all
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
I don't want to be with anybody at all
I don't want to be seen with anybody at all
The world is much too big for me to handle alone
But I don't want no friends, I want to stay on my own
The planet's turning but I can't stand still
The clock is ticking but I can't stop time
And all I want is to be by myself
Do you think that's a crime?
Do you think that's a crime?

It don't mean a thing
If It ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing
If It ain't got that swing
Doo Uap, Doo Uap, Doo Uap, Doo Uap
Doo Uap, Doo Uap, Doo Uap, Doo Uap

Be my sunrise at 12
My wish to my well
Be that potion, my spell
The whole reason I fell
Be that pearl in my shell
Be my sunrise when night falls
Show me something unfamiliar
Show me something you can put in words
Show me something that you never heard
Take me to another end
Baby make it unfamiliar, unfamiliar
Baby make it unfamiliar
Make it unfamiliar
Show me something unfamiliar
Your body is monumental
You can set the _____
Have a shower
Be that pearl in my shell
Be my sunrise when night falls
My hate when time crawls
Show me something unfamiliar
Show me something you can put in words
Show me something that you never heard
Take me to another end
Baby make it unfamiliar, unfamiliar
Baby make it unfamiliar
Make it unfamiliar
Make it unfamiliar
Make it unfamiliar
Make it unfam

Here we are like we're going to get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again
It's peaking up now, getting more like a game
And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But u can always tell your better half
Always tell your better half of the story
It goes well with the better side of your face u show on TV
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution
What's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?
U cut the wings and then u say fly
U say the hero is the one that died
But the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands
That there's an end out of the cycle
Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
U can do what u can, but will u do it again?
So what's the plan?
Looks like we are going to get war again
Here we are like we're going to get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again
It's peaking up now, getting more like a game
And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But u can always tell your better half
Look out
Going to get war again, going to get wrong again
Gone again, with the same song again, on again
Can't be born again, who's gone again?
Who's going to gain out of this war again?
Hooligan in a tie rule again
Soon again u will see it all begin again
Sink again, and that will make u think again
And when they call u go
When they are wrong u know
And u will fallow, and u will swallow
Again like long ago the bomb will blow
So sit back relax and enjoy the show
Cuz' u are as cold as snow and I am here below
I'm going to speak out, scream out
Here we go, got the fresh flow
So before it's over
Then u are going to find a different kind of war to start again
Going to get war again

Callas went away
But her voice forever stay
Callas went away
She went away
Ah! je les relis sans cesse
Je devais les detruire
Ces lettres! Ces lettres!
(Ah! I read them constantly
I ought to destroy them
These letters! These letters!)
God bless you

Please do not follow where I am leading
Someone must clear these things away
Here in the burnt out husk of the morning
Struck out with nothing left to say
Yeah this was one hell of a party
Nobody ever got to bed
But the morning after's killing me
And I have to rest my head
And just where were we trying to get to
I can't recall one single word
And the faces that pushed themselves before you
Congeal into one, nothing transferred
This was one hell of a party
And it's still living in my head
But the morning after shines so cold
So follow where I live

I'll put you down as the third alternative,
When you get to the bottom of the list,
In the call for sanity,
Nothing breathes,
So I'll put you up as a friend of Mary's,
'Cause when she's raring to go she's quite contrary.
In the race for courage,
Everyone's gone blind.
You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer.
Happy in a manic sort of way,
But I'm real on a manic high day,
The universe has left behind us,
All behind.
You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer killer killer killer.
The universe has left behind us,
All behind.
You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer killer killer killer.
I can't let go of the past,
When it's my future,
That's safe and rosy,
I can't step out onto the street,
When it's my moods,
That keep me broody.
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens,
Throw it out and see what happens.

The wind caught the seagull and chased it off the shore
See how it trembles
Givin' in, drifting off
A boy lit a cigarette
While the girl closed the door
These hopeless romantic fools
Wont be lovers no more
But see how the waves are rushing in
And see how the waves are washing off
Leaving the shore so pure
Cleansing until its white as snow
A dear's gasping for air
Its made its last mistake
A fool for old natures rules
Drifts away in the wake of the dawn
A car leaves the front yard
Of a house she calls home
Her man wont be back again
Wont be home anymore
But see how the waves are rushing in
And see how the waves are washing off
Leaving the shore so pure
Cleansing until its white as snow

Feel the vibes from outside, touch the blaze of emotion
Feel it raise to your mind
Feel the vibes from outside, touch the blaze of emotion
Cause you're one of a kind
Woohoh a cosmic evolution's here tonight
Woohoh a cosmic evolution's in your life
Waves are flowing - Positions are uncertain
See the interference - Feel it next to your mind
Rays are approaching - Energy is increasing
Quantized absorption - Feel it next to your mind
The world is uncertain - Action ruled by chance
Try to feel control - You're one of a kind
Distance is connected - Faster than the light
Listen to the bell - You're one of a kind

I've never pretending have the truth,
Anyhow I should listened to you,
I'm very sorry... is it right now
Be a friend,
Don't look at my expand
So concerned,
Despite your empty words
I can be there but
Leave me breathing
Don't despair,
I know why,
I'm so alive
Heads, to say you have it
Tails to say you don't
Lost for words and I think
Time to take you home
Caught you up a ladder
Trying to end it all
Is it any wonder
I believe no more
You don't see dear
You shouldn't play god
You got something on your mind
Just lock it off
You smile a little more
You stop saying
You don't seem to be the trying type after all
I'll break your fouling saying
You could have been nothing
Be a friend,
Don't look at my expand
I can be there but
Leave me breathing
Don't despair,
I know why,
I'm so alive
Do leave me breathing
Don't despair
I know why I' m so alive
You don't see dear
You shouldn't pay god
You got something on your mind
Just lock it off
You smile a little more
You stop saying no
You don't seem to be the trying type after all
Sight to nothing
The sight of the world
Sight of the, sight
Be like everyone
Be like everyone and
Be like everyone
Do you like, do you me there, let's go away
Be like everyone ...
Anyday now we could leave town,
And down, take a car in London Town, take a London

Something has come between me and the world that knew
What I thought would last is falling apart in the face of something new
How can I explain that I had no choice
The sound of the waves fills her ears and drowns out my voice
And I'm just too far away for her to believe what I say
She couldn't hear me, she wouldn't listen anyway
How can I write a letter the post is so slow
If I'm to disappoint her then that's something she ought to know
I can just hear her voice fall as I wait here alone
How can so much harm be done by just two minutes spent on the phone
You say that things will get better
But she would hate me if I let her
And she reads so much in every word that I say
I thought that being apart would just bring us some variety
But after some time it seems clear that she's changed in a different way from
Me
And I would like to shout at someone but no one's to blame
It's just her it's just me and everything that is
Just not the same
Sometimes I would turn back the clock
And recapture all that we've lost
But I couldn't give up all that we have today

Leaving at dawn to beat the traffic, do you remember that too?
Curled asleep on the back seat, do you remember that too?
The soundless dark, the empty road, do you remember that too?
And that child asleep, only eight years old, do you recognise as you?
June, July, September, stretched ahead and out of view
The whole world seemed a safe place and never ending too
And it was never as simple as you thought
They were just things you never knew
And up ahead, your parents bore the weight
Of all their worries and yours too
Windows down on the coast road, wanting to be first to see the sea
The whole world seemed a safe place, temporarily
But it was never as simple as you thought
And you found out as you grew
That up ahead, your parents had borne the weight
Of all their worries and yours too
All their worries and yours too

Yo, met this piece by the name of Sharise
She had a fly one hundred ninety restin' in Jones Beach
You know when we kickin' my everyday cliche
Yo boo, can I poly with you, what make my day
She threw her chin up in the air, said yeah
Your style is played out, black, like last year
What do you mean huh? You know what I mean Dunn
Callin' me Dunn had me open like I was the one
What did I have on God Guard or Clairborne
You know you had that rugged type of shit on Raekwon
Maybe I talk a bit, kick a few words and shit
But you drove off in some Nissan phat shit
Givin' me bad looks, lookin' like mad crooks
If I was a purse downtown I would have been took
Yeah from robsters, but you look like mobsters
Smokin' that weed had me nauseous like rastas
When we're together you blow my mind, uh huh
You have that way about ya that keeps me satisfied (Whatcha want)
All I want to do is give you all I got
If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got)
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be)
I want to be there for you boy in every way
I just gotta tell you how you take my breath away
Oh I want to let you know
When you walked into my life (Walked into my life)
I had this feeling you brought my world alive
And I'm going crazy, my head is in a daze (Head is in a daze)
You amaze me, boy why don't you stay (Boy why don't you stay)
If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got)
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be)
She's a fly fabulous bird from outta nowhere
We bungalo dolo in logear, free parole the whole year
Now acknowledge me God mentality, fly formality
Cut out on me, I'm kidnappin' half of your salary
We movin' like this, for real now shut down your will power
Flower whatever you doin' don't disrespect ours
Slidin' my work to the next man
Still I'm givin' you props now gets your karats on the nightstand
When you walked into my life (Walked into my life)
I had this feeling you brought my world alive
And I'm going crazy, my head is in a daze (Head is in a daze)
You amaze me, boy why don't you stay (Boy why don't you stay)
If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got)
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be)
If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got)
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be)

What's that you see?
There's all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Orbiting you and me
Just one glimpse can change a life, change a life, change a life
And you can see
Through all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Orbiting you and me
One glimpse change a life, change a life, change a life, change it
I get so haunted, That I fall in your dreams tonight
I get so haunted, That I misunderstood tonight
What's that you see?
There's all the satellites, satellites, satellites
Haunting you and me
Just one glimpse can change a life, change a life, change a life
And you can see
Through all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Haunting you and me
One glimpse change a life, change a life, change a life, change it
I get so haunted, That I fall in your dreams tonight
I get so haunted, That I misunderstood tonight
I get so haunted, That I fall in your dreams tonight
I get so haunted, That I misunderstood tonight
This is real, this is what you search out
And you wouldn't believe, you could never see it's true
You can leave, and you could go out, search out
Harbor daze
Harbor daze
In a harbor daze
In a harbor daze

[Intro]
PJ pump it up, go
[Verse]
I take the cup to the face
I need some love for your love
You got them tears on your pillowcase
You said the past just don't erase
I ain't even tryna have fun
This winter tryna stack funds
Say they proud but they sound jealous
Truth is I'ont feel the effort
She don't need me, just work for it
Situation gettin' worse for her
Say she dancin', makin' ends meet
I ain't actin', I'm just bein' me

You know that I just can't forget you

Fortune is bleak
A dog returns to his master
Too much luck is bad luck
A man who lives well
Stands to bargain his winnings
He'll raise his hat and emerge unscathed
Face the good life alone
Too much luck is bad luck
The king, watching with his queen, a deck below the scene
The pair had weakness in the heart mark them from the start
No man has enough luck to save himself from his fellow man
The man who wins more than his share finds doubt cast on his skill
Rewards bestowed from who knows where betray the player's hand
No man has enough luck to save himself from his fellow man
Fortune is bleak
A dog returns to his master
Too much luck is a gift, a curse, a sign
A-a-a-a-ah...too much luck is bad luck...

I've never felt so free
I've never felt so free before
You can't stop me
From walking out the door
I've never felt so free before
We'll put the bad times behind us
Put some sugar and stir it up
I know we're gonna make it better
No more bittersweet loving
No no no more, I've never felt so free
I've got a place to go that I call my own
I'll say it out loud, standing proud
Free to browse on my own
I've got a place to go that I call my own
On my own, no bittersweet lovin'

I'm going to give you a coming-out party, at your house.
It's perfect. You can't refuse.
It's my gift to you.
It's your fantasy.
Fantasia, having a party is not my idea of a fantasy,
especially right now.
The party isn't the fantasy!
I know what you'd like.
It's the fantasy you once told me about.
Remember?
I don't remember telling you about it.
What is it?
What's the fantasy?

can you see these eyes
these eyes so bright
day and night they need you
are awaiting you
quiet days passed me by
silent tears who will cry
filled with thoughts for you
nights are cold without you
and slowly comes my night
quiet colors calm my eyes
and step by step i understand
it is a question of time
and wherever you are
hiding far away or close to me
send my answers to your land
out of my darkened hole
i will never give up
time will never stand still
come back home piece of art
and embrace my sin
and slowly comes my night
quiet colors calm my eyes
and step by step i understand
it is a question of time
peace will grow in this heart
it will never fall apart
colours light on canvas white
all the portraits start to sing
songs of good songs they know
all these answers start with if
will we redefine the line
fight against all these crimes
and slowly comes my night
quiet colors calm my eyes
and step by step i understand
it is a question of time

We fling ourselves fearlessly,
With lights upon our faces
into insecurity and unity
We dream ourselves fearlessly,
With laughter in our eyes,
But no one has a steady look at last
You go in the morning, the morn before light
Warm is the bed and my back where you'd lie
Slowly my awakening, my breathing in haze
And so I know I do belong here,
I will sing to the day

(Oh, oh) You got me spinning spinning spinning
You came in deep, I'm hijacked, it's a holdup
I'm on the Ritz and we spinning every time we touch
My head is gone and I think and think about you much
I've never been the type of girl to dream about
Sugary things and I don't believe in fairy tales
But now to me it's like your love is oxygen
So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just make me so crazy
I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Every single thing you do just set my heart on fire
I struggle to breathe, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Start it again, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire
All about the feeling, it's off, and I'm ahead in this
It's a chemistry, I'm so jacked up on your medicine
This thing is next, I'm so in, I'll take it any chance, no
Boy, you got me freaking, I never thought I'd be like this
When you go, I'm tweaking and pining for another fix
Told you before, your love is my oxygen
So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just makes me so crazy
I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Every single thing you do just set my heart on fire
I struggle to breathe, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Start it again, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire
So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just makes me so crazy
I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Every single thing you do just set my heart on fire
I struggle to breathe, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Start it again, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire

Do you listen to your classical records any more?
Or do you let them sleep in their sleeves, where they be?
Do you suffer through those records that you turned around?
Or do you make them sleep in their sleeves where they weep?
Vinyl tears
I had a line but I don't remember
I had a time but I don't remember
I had a line but I don't remember
Anything

I never left the room
I never turn the corner
I never cut the wire again
I couldn't bear to see
Another static ocean
Another drop of honesty
Another day could push me
Another day could kill me
Another day could knock me out
And I will sing
This life will shine
And we can be
This love divine
Don't want to know
What we might find
Cause sitting in your arms
Is your love (your love your love)
Don't let me down
And I will sing
This life will shine
And we can be
This love divine
Don't want to know
What we might find
Cause sitting in your arms
Is your love (your love your love)
Don't let me down
Another day could push me
Another day could kill me
Another day could knock me out
And I will sing
This life will shine
And we can be
This love divine
Don't want to know
What we might find
Cause sitting in your arms
Is your love (your love your love)
Don't let me down

North Star
Where are you
Come guide me home
This love
Wont end
If I see you soon
I cant turn night to day
I can explain it
Oh please
North star, come bring me home
It's been a long time coming
But its well worth waiting
And I raise my hands
And ask for nothing more
If we are of the same mind, finally
It was worth the calamity of you being mad at me
You know I've got feelings too they come stealing through
And batter me properly revealing my sensitivity
We don't get this time for free
Take my hand and promise me your love and honesty
And this soliloquy would not have been in vain
On our journey of life lets take the slow train
(It's been a long time coming)
Waiting for the train
(It's well worth waiting)
Take my hand
(And I raise my hands)
We don't get this time for free
(And ask for nothing more)
Hey
Its been a long time coming
But its well worth waiting
And I raise my hands
And ask for nothing more
L-O-N-G time coming
Its been a long time coming
This bright star shining (inginging...)

We enter the room
You're bright the darkness my love
In moments with you
There is no end tp me or beginning to you
We move to the floor
A purpose combined my love
Like the motions of stars
Our dynamic symmetry combines
Break my fall
I found what was missing inside you
Break my fall
Na na na na na na na
Break my fall
I found what is missing inside you
Break my fall
Na na na na na na na
Always with you
Connected by blood my love
A purpose fulfilled
You're my light in this dark, dark world
This unspoken within
I feel complete my love
The moments apart
I'm craving your light in the dark
Break my fall
I found what is missing inside you
Break my fall
Na na na na na na na
Break my fall
I found what is missing inside you
Break my fall
Na na na na na na na

Come with me tonight
All across the universe, we will sail for the skies
Meet behind Mars
We will hold each other as we sail for the stars
On a cosmic bling

Making star love in the night

I'm making star love in the night
I'm making star love in the night
Why don't you
Why don't you

Too many hours on the road
Too many days as you grow older
And tears are spilled
As each moment unfolds
Your head is resting upon my shoulder
And I'm quietly thrilled
Did I miss that smile?
Did I miss that first step?
All the moments you supposed
Not to forget
You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me
I used to fear what you bring
I didn't know if I could love you
The way you deserve
You make me feel like a king
A day is no longer what I get through
You're my everything
Did I miss that smile?
Did I miss that first step?
All the moments you supposed
Not to forget
You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me
You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me
If I could turn back time
And be there for every minute
Give up the life I chose
Just to have you in it
If I could turn back time
And be there for every minute
Give up the life I chose
Just to have you in it

Here I come to find myself catch the tide
Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself, fever's high
I'm all at sea and so unwise
I'm so afraid I'll lose your love as times goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset built a memory, our love sign
And all at sea we come alive
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I design
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all at sea we say goodbye
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
Looking for a place called home
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home

We're clear the sail
Come back to give
Walking on
In grief and fear
With dirty hands
And muddy shoes
Another day
We gonna lose
We burn the bridges
On our way
We've come to know
There's just black and white
Got to go on
Even if we stray
Crossing borders to another side
We're crossing borders to another side
We're crossing borders to another side
We're clear to sail
Come back to give
Walking on
In grief and fear
With dirty hands
And muddy shoes
Another day
We gonna lose
We burn the bridges
On our way
We've come to know
There's just black and white
Got to go on
Even if we stray
Crossing borders to another side
To another side
To another side
To another side
To another side

Tentei contar
Tentei cantar
Tentei just la la la ia
Tentei tocar
Também dançar
Assim, só para deixar
Só quero te dar
Se te falar
Se te just la la la ia
Só quero estar
Com seu cantar
Com seu just la la la ia
Just like this rainstorm
This August day song
I dream of places far beyond
Ouvindo a chuva cair
No cinza um brilho aqui
Fico sózinha, distraída
Mesmo tom
Mesmo som
Como é bom, tão bom
Just like this rainstorm
This August day song
I dream of places far beyond
Ouvindo a chuva cair
No pé um pingo aqui
Fico sózinha, tão distraída
Não vou chorar
Quando lembrar
Do seu eterno olhar
I like to sing
And do these things
With you just prá variar
I hear your voice
I sing for choice
With you just la la la ia
Mesmo tom
Mesmo som
Como é bom, tão bom
Mesmo tom
Mesmo som
Como é bom, tão bom

I'm going out to get some air will you join me
I want to feel the wind on my face will you join me
Let my hair fall on my shoulders
Let the sun shine on my skin
I dreamt too much last night
And then I couldn't sleep
Worries got a hold of me
Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me
Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me
Hiding me in the folds of my clothes
I was once, full of milk and honey
The ground dries up, beneath my feet
I'm eating dust I want to breath
I dreamt too much last night
And then I couldn't sleep
Worries got a hold of me
Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me
Men they oppress me
Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me
Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me
Men they oppress me
Suffocating me
Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me
Men they oppress me
Suffocating me

And still he lies awake at night
Restless while every silence screams
And still she sleeps turned to the wall
He fears the onslaught of his dream
Touches her back but she doesn't stir
Then round her hand his finger close
Feeling the ring that cost more than the car
All of those questions that never arose
And still she lies awake at night
Silently stares at the bedroom wall
Feeling his hand dare to touch her back
It's been a month since he started to paint the hall
And brightly burns the landing light
The baby's screaming down the hall
She shuts her eyes and she shuts her ears
She's had it up to here because it's not his baby after all

Dolphin, faced for the crime
The birthday of time

Walk before you see us walking
Talk before you hear us talking
Hold before we flee off holding, holding
Cry and all the roughens crying, crying
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
See
Foxes what we are when releasing, leasing
What draws us in this feeling, feelings
From the stops of makeup crumbling, crumbling
And all the fancy dresses floating, floating
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
Who never cut wiser
Of all the people
We are the saddest ones
We're just falling stars that never cut wiser
Of all the people
We are the saddest ones
We're just falling stars who never cut wiser
Walk (Walk in, step in, step into control)
Walk (Walk in, step in, step into control)
Walk (Walk in, step in, step into control)
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser﻿

What happened here?
The butterfly has lost its wings
The air's too thick to breathe
And there's something in the drinking water.
The sun comes up
The sun comes up and you're alone
Your sense of purpose come undone
The traffic tails back to the maze on 101
And the news from the sky
Is looking better for today
In every single way
But not for you
World citizen
World citizen
It's not safe
All the yellow birds are sleeping
Cos the air's not fit for breathing
It's not safe
Why can't we be
Without beginning, without end?
Why can't we be?
World citizen
World citizen
And if I stop
And talk with you awhile
I'm overwhelmed by the scale
Of everything you feel
The lonely inner state emergency
I want to feel
Until my heart can take no more
And there's nothing in this world I wouldn't give
I want to break
The indifference of the days
I want a conscience that will keep me wide awake
I won't be disappointed
I won't be disappointed
I won't be.
I saw a face
It was a face I didn't know
Her sadness told me everything about my own
Can't let it be
When least expected there she is
Gone the time and space that separates us
And I'm not safe
I think I need a second skin
No, I'm not safe
World citizen
World citizen
I want to travel by night
Across the steppes and over seas
I want to understand the cost
Of everything that's lost
I want to pronounce all their names correctly
World citizen
World citizen
I won't be disappointed
I won't be.
She doesn't laugh
We've gone from comedy to commerce
And she doesn't feel the ground she walks upon
I turn away
And I'm not sleeping well at night
And while I know this isn't right
What can you do?

And I long to go
Love started. Here
Shoot your star
Be a light
Is that
Don't you call
Deer stop bottle in a shell
Shoot a thousand stars over me
Love to come home
You've arrested a knight
Say my name,
Whisper it
Don't ever turn
I'm deliciously wired
I'm falling in a cloud
Shoot a thousand stars over
Say my name
Whisper it

An earthly nurse sits and sings
And aye she sings of lily-wean
Saying "Little ken I my bairn's father
Far less the land that he comes from"
So he came one night to her bed feet
And a grumbly guest I'm sure was he
Saying "Here am I thy bairn's father
Although I be not comely"
And he had taken a purse of gold
And he had placed it on her knee
Saying "Give to me my little young son
And take thee up thy nurse's fee
For I am a man upon the land
And I am a Silkie on the sea
And when I'm far and far from land
My home it is in Sule Skerry
For it shall come to pass on a summer's day
When the sun shines bright on every stone
I'll come and fetch my little young son
And teach him how to swim the foam
And ye shall marry a gunner good
And a right fine gunner I'm sure he'll be
And the very first shot that ever he shoots
Will kill both my young son and me
For I am a man upon the land
And I am a Silkie on the sea
And when I'm far and far from land
My home it is in Sule Skerry"

There's a fire around,
heaven is falling down.
See the stars all around,
heaven is falling.
Is there anybody out there?
Heaven is falling.
Is there anybody out there?
Heaven is falling (falling, falling, falling, falling)
Heaven is falling.
Is there anybody out there?
Heaven is falling.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your-put your hands up.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your-put your hands up.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your-put your hands up.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your fucking hands up!
Put your fucking hands up!
Your desire is mine.
Take me higher than life. (Heaven is falling)
Is there anybody out there?
Heaven is falling.
Is there anybody out there?
Put your hands up.
Is there anybody out there?
Heaven is falling.
Is there anybody out there?
Heaven is falling.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your-put your hands up.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your-put your hands up.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your-put your hands up.
If you're ready for the drop, then put your fucking hands up!
Put your fucking hands up!

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
An inner feeling comes around
Let it sparkle and let it shine
Let it lift you off the ground
Make it last baby make it mine
You are the sun that rises
You are the moon that lights the night
You are what paralyses me
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will, say you care
Write my name into the sky
Keep the memories in your heart
Let the hours pass us by
I guess that this is the way we start
You are the love suprises
You are a fire burning bright
You are what mesmerizes me
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will, say you care
Say you care
Say you care
Say you care
No, no, no, no
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
(Dare, dare, dare)
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will, say you care

My skin is like a map
Of where my heart has been
And I cant hide the marks
Its not a negative thing
So I let down my guard
Drop my defences down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall
With no safety net to cushion the blow
I bruise easily
So be gentle when you handle me
Theres a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too
But if I never take this leap of faith
I'll never know
So im learning to fall
With no safety net to cushion the blow
I bruise easily
So be gentle when you handle me
Theres a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
Anyone who can touch you
Can hurt you or heal you
Anyone who can reach you
Can love you or leave you
So be gentle
I bruise easily
So be gentle when you handle me
Theres a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
I bruise easily

I miss those times
I miss those days
When you were around
So many ways
And it felt so safe
And I was glad
But now something's changed
Makes me sad
And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now
Won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again
And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now
Won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again
If you're doing fine
I don't know
You see, I gave up calling
Long time ago
Haven't heard from you
I guess that means
That I'm not good no more
That's what it seems
And I was waiting patiently
But you never came
I realize it now
Won't ever be the same, again
Won't ever be the same, again

Take money.
Flex that muscle.
Can't stop, everyday hustle.
I want to feel, peace of mind.
Like false-trace sipping potion.
Stars come out.
Frank Ocean.
I want to feel that open wide.
Ohhh, oh. Ohhh, oh. We all know when the night comes. Ohhh, oh. Ohhh, oh.
Should have known better than to cheat a friend.
Shit gets real and I pretend.
I hope the late text that I sent for sex will flowers.
Two young lovers in the freezing cold.
Naked bodies, painted gold.
Just wanna breathe fire to your gypsy soul, but anyway.
Painted gold, gold x4
Painted gold, gold.
Ohhhh, ohhh. Ohhhh, ohhh.
Such poise, so charismatic.
Get numb, go spastic.
I'd like to find some peace of mind.
Yeah, we Starbucks y'all just foldgers.
Meet my electric soldiers.
Sell off your pride, for peace of mind.
Ohhh, oh. Ohhh, oh. We all know when the night comes.
Ohhh, oh. Ohhh, oh.
Should have known better than to cheat a friend.
Shit gets real and I pretend.
I hope that late text that I sent for sex will flowers.
Two young lovers in the freezing cold.
Naked bodies, painted gold.
Just wanna breathe fire to your gypsy soul, but anyway.
Painted gold, gold x4
Painted gold.
Ohhhh, ohhh. Ohhhh, ohhh.
As I'm breathing her in, this art on my skin, it reminds me to choose.
Noo ohhh, ohhh.
As I call out her name, a slave to a game, and destined to lose.
Noo ohhh, ohhh.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend.
Shit gets real then I pretend.
I hope that late text that I sent for sex will flowers.
Just two young lovers in the freezing cold.
Naked bodies, painted gold.
Just want to breathe fire to your gypsy soul, but anyway.
Painted gold, gold x4.
(I should have known better than to cheat a friend.)
Gold x4.
(Shit gets real then I pretend.)
Gold x4.
(Just two young lovers in the freezing cold.)
Gold x4.
(Naked bodies, painted gold.)
Painted gold. Painted gold.
Two naked bodies, painted gold.
oh, oh, oh, oh.
And I'll paint them gold.
Yeah, I'll paint them gold.
And I'll paint them gold.
Yeah, I'll paint them gold.

I've had to leave
But still can see you
Almost every single day
When desire overwhelms me
But more important is
What I can do
Although I really want to
Feel and smell your perfect skin
An obscure picture on my screen
Is all that's left of you
Your voice distorted from my speakers
And there's nothing else I can do
This is a lesson for our love
We have to be patient for now
But while the time is passing by
We will find a way somehow
So I can't wait
To see you here
In flesh and blood in real life
Satisfying all my senses

come strange boy
turn down the machines
when the wheel turns slow
when the wheel turns slow
now you must take the copper
of your curls in your hands
if the feeling is low
if the feeling is low
with your mind at the races
and your heart on the moon
in the reeling of dawn
in the reeling of dawn
there is a light with a meaning
that makes your black eyes blink
that's where the feeling is from

who was born on the day

and her eyes tourmaline
and a voice to remind you
that there only is feeeeeeeeeeeeeling

off his horse made of glass
until the feeling gets better
until the feeling gets better
off the road to tulula
with its sidewalks of sand
that's where the feeling has gone
that's where the feeling has gone
for every you there's a strangegirl
who was born on the day
that the devil's forgotten
so your lover was made
with her hair that is golden
and her eyes tourmaline
and a voice to remind you
that there only is feeeeeeeeeeeeeling
and her feeling is strong
and her feeling is strong
now the feeling is on

We are young and alive
The moment has arrived
To rise up and get out
Before the stars go down
We can go on and on tonight
You know it's gonna be alright
Step into the firelight
And everything will be alright
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, fire, firelight
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, stop the firelight
We can go on and on tonight
You know it's gonna be alright
Step into the firelight
And everything will be alright
We gotta turn the love around
Before the stars go down
So ignite your other side
And step into the firelight
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, fire, firelight
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, stop the firelight
Here's a brand new start
Leave the world behind
Open up your heart
Clear it out of your mind
We can go on and on tonight
You know it's gonna be alright
Step into the firelight
And everything will be alright
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, fire, firelight
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, stop the firelight
We can go on and on tonight
You know it's gonna be alright
Step into the firelight

So ignite your other side
And step into the firelight
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, fire, firelight
You can't stop, stop, stop
The fire, fire, stop the firelight

Love the way I feel, streets replaced with fields.
Wide awake in here, you shine.
Ran away from goals, left you in the cold.
Nothing's in our way tonight.
You know that you'll never be replaced.
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me.
And either way our time won't go to waste
Our﻿ hearts will never be the same again.
Our hearts will never be the same again.
Our hearts will never be the same again.

Welcome me father on the North shores of Lapland
Welcome me father who knows no name
Welcome me mother the earth here is yawning
My body is shaking for want of a flame
Down here, got to laugh
The kickback is lightening
Drowning, got to laugh
This whole mess is frightening
A follower of the pollen path
The pollen path
Welcome me father the lava is rising
Welcome me mother and give me your name
We've drunk from this wellspring too long, too long
Dividing the hours to measure the time
We've lived with this heartache too long, too long
Numbering what's yours, what's mine
We've harbored this sadness so long
Nursing a voice, just sing us our songs
Raising a voice to sing our songs

Ill let a train be my feet if its too far to walk to you
And if a train dont go there
Ill get a jet or a bus 'cuz Im gonna find you
Youre gonna see my shadow soon around you
And my head is my only house unless it rains
Ive walked the meadow plains
While the desert's on my eyes until I find you
I wont sleep until I find you
I wont eat until I find
And my heart wont beat
Until I wrap my arms around you
And my arms are just two things
In the way till I can wrap them around you
You can make a sad song happy
And a bad world good
I can feel you out there moving
Youre mine and I know Ill find you
And my head is my only house until I found you
I hate to hear other people
Hear me sing this song
If it reaches you before I do
Follow this song [Incomprehensible]
Thats where Ill find you
And my head is my only house unless it rains
And my head is my only house unless it rains
And my head is my only house unless it rains
And my head is my only house
My head is my only house
My head is my only house
My head is my only house unless it rains
Unless it rains, unless it rains, unless it rains

Whats you name, angel?
Mathilda...
I've got no place to go
Leon, I've got no place
Leon, I've got no place to go
Such a loneliness in this place
All the raid are out, looking for, a kid that's not to far a (night)
What is loving with no heart to guide
What is living with no hope inside
Smile, don't move, how's that
Hey little angel
Smile, don't move, how's that
You won't feel no more pain
Smile, don't move, how's that
(So got it) going on cause
Don't move, how's that
We've found a reason, a good reason to stick together
I need this Leon
Have been dying in this weird space
No more running child
Nothing but the sad existence
Were you just talking when the words are lies
Were you just crying when my tears are dry
Smile, don't move, how's that
Hey little angel
Smile, don't move, how's that
No more fear, no more pain
Smile, don't move, how's that
(So got it) going on cause
Don't move, how's that
We've found a reason, a good reason to stick together
Hey baby, been really great with me ,baby
What you need, I need time to get, time to get,
Cool baby, hey baby, been really great with me,
Baby, what you need, I need time to get, time to get,
Right baby, so, it's exactly what you need
Smile, don't move, how's that

You and me in the photobooth
Waiting for the flash and close the curtain urgently
You and me like young lovers do
Timing for the kiss and close enough to hear you breathe
You and me in the photobooth
Waiting for the flash, style with a cup of tea
You and me in the photobooth
Giving it the natch, posing like we're this year's models
You take a lot and call me up
You show up
I suppose you're right, I tell a lie
You miss
You wanna shake it right down
You wanna leave me somehow
On black and white negatives
You wanna shake it right
You wanna shake it right down
You wanna leave me somehow
On black and white negatives
So you wanna shake it right
You and me in the photobooth
You and me like young lovers do
You and me in the photobooth
Waiting for the flash, style with a cup of tea

Into pattern
Flowing blood
Giving form
In every part
The whole you see
Into pattern
Flowing blood
Giving form

Nature conspires to help you

human size parks trying to hard to keep the head up and make it look bright
human size traps smoking to death
dying to smoking
shouting to talk
i can't stand blackstrobe lights or dancefloor
life where we all hide
cause i can't stand black strobe lights where we can hide
and we can't face suicides

The street's reaching up to the open window
Too much information leaks in
And shoots up my spine
Lifting my head off the pillow
And the dust rises
When I set my feet on the floor
I breathe in and out while I try to focus
When I feel ok I twist my mouth
To save what little air is left
'Cause it's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
It's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
To survive, to survive, to survive
This situation, situation, situation
To survive, to survive, to survive
This situation, situation, situation
I keep far away but I'm missing nothing
My eyes are an endless panorama of blue
There's nothing here to block my view
And with a sideways glance
I am shown as much as I want to see
'Cause it's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
It's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
In full motion
No variation
This need for speed
The notion of convulsion
This seed of greed
Shock activities
Lack of memories
Don't wanna be
Cannot see
Anything wrong with the picture
'Cause it's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
It's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
To survive, to survive, to survive
This situation, situation, situation
To survive, to survive, to survive
This situation, situation, situation
'Cause it's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
It's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
It's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions
It's a question of constructing
An imitation of conditions...

Breath.
Our dear children, they're turning blue, smoke in their lungs.
Please, breath. They're just children.
Finding out that whores bring sores.
Breath.
Our dear children, they're turning blue, smoke in their lungs.
Please, breath. They're just children.
Finding out that we all die.
Smile, pale green eyes. We're breeding suicide.
Let me take what you dispise and paint it grey.
When we count the mistakes, all the moments awake...
When you count all these stars, when it's gone too far.
I think it's time I burn this city.
Washed clean and slain.
We love our sheep, we love to look the other way.
Washed clean and slain.
We love our sheep, we love to eat what we can't maintain.

Come on everybody, listen to what I want to say
I got news for you and it goes this way
Let's start by screamin' and shoutin' it all night long
'Cause this is where we all belong
We've got soul in our hearts, we got soul in our blood
And you better believe that we just can't stop
Come on baby, come on baby
If you hear my voice, baby, let me know
I am ready, yes, I'm ready
Ready for the sound, ready for the groove
I am ready, yes, I'm ready
Let me, let me, let me bust a move
Ooh, ooh
Come on
Come on
Get ready
Come on
Come on
You can't fake the feeling, just be who you wanna be
I'm a part of you as you're a part of me
'Cause baby, this time we're taking it to the top
And we won't ever let it stop
If you wanna get up, if you wanna get down
I can turn you up and around and around
Come on baby, come on baby
If you hear my voice, baby, let me know
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
I am ready, yes, I'm ready
Ready for the sound, ready for the groove
I am ready, yes, I'm ready
Let me, let me, let me
I am ready, yes, I'm ready
Ready for the sound, ready for the groove
I am ready, yes, I'm ready
Let me, let me, let me bust a move

Pleasantly removed
Into lush darkness
Into the dreamless place
I begin to sing this song
Staying loud enough
To drown out any noise
In presence of strangers
I begin to sing this song
It appears to be done
For the pleasure of the doing
But I'm no better shape
Than my fellow riders
Every now and then
I'm slipping back again
Empty and mortal
I begin to sing this song
My mind is moving fast
Trying to make connections
Taking short-cuts
Noting events
Listing all
Filing away
Along with opinions
Making connections
Taking short-cuts
Noting events
Listing all
Filing away
Along with opinions
Making connections
Taking short-cuts
Noting events...
It appears to be done
For the pleasure of the doing
But I'm no better shape
Than my fellow riders...

I wish the milkman would deliver my milk in the morning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk when I'm yawning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk in the morning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk when I'm yawning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk in the morning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk when I'm yawning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk in the morning
I wish the milkman would deliver my milk when I'm yawning
I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits
I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits
I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits
I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits

High tails, and low tails
Love has knowledge
Story on story
Would you marry me?
23 lies you told
Many more lives you hold
Thought I could believe
Thought I could believe
How long can you play this?
How long can you last?
Gaze up, you're so restless
On your way down fast
23 lies you told
Many more lives you hold
23 lies you told
Many more lives you hold
Thought I could believe

There is no shuffle
There is no shuffle here
Here on the North Pole
On this quiet dome
Sunshine on crystal
And milky walls of ice
All seem so fragile
Under the polar sky
Cold in head
But warm in the heart
You could find pleasure
You could find displeasure
There is no sound here
But the rumbling waves
Of the polar sea
I know this anger burning inside of you
And I'm afraid I can feel it too
I know this anger burning inside of you
There is an ice-floe between you and me
This is the place
This is the only place
Cold in the head
Warm in the heart

Episode's out the window
Tracking's well defined
Continue 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow's out of time
Intercepted
Satellite malfunction
Recorded
Embedded conversation
Pictures capture crisis
Reports from on the spot
Consume me
Ruin me
I don't know what you're doin' to me
The truest belief
Busted like clueless thiefs
It has proven to me
That I'm losin' the lead
With the booze and the weed
Laced like shoes to my feet
Where the 2's follows 3's
and the blues mix with greens
Hit the snooze...
Now it's back to your dreams
and the things that make you feel
Oh so nice
and the only time I find them
is the middle of the night
Live action entertainment
Close your eyes to make it stop!
Episode's out the window
Tracking's well defined
Continue 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow's out of time
Screen is green
Look at that
I'd settle for a hurricane
But it's war in Iraq
Iran

Black night is fallen
The sun has gone to bed
The innocent are dreaming
As you should sleepyhead
Sleepyhead
Sleepyhead
All the love above
I send into you
Comfort and protection (I'll watch over you)
But don't ask me what's gonna happen next
I know the future
I'd love to read you the way (Just to make it easier on you)
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
My dearest scatter heart
Serious comfort
Right in the eye of the hurricane
Just to make it easier on you
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
Ah huh huh huh huh
All the hurt in the world
You know there's nothing I'd love to do more
Then spare you from that burden (It's gonna be hard)
If I only could
Shelter you from that pain (Just to make it easier on you)
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself (Ah huh huh huh)
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
Ah huh huh huh

We float before the sea and eyes
Getting heavy mixing glitter thighs
I smile because I won't do
I smile because you won't do
We sip the wind through lips alive
And added cones won't whistle lone
I smile because I won't do
I smile because you won't do
Put flowers in your hand
Wrap pretend around my chest
I smile because I won't do
I am your bore
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
Down by the shore a funny foe
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
He left before I come through
You left before I come through
We took the heals into trees
I hid my hand and bit the leaves
You left before I come through
You left before I
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
Drinks are stale, fell through the beat
Wrapped in life and ultra-green
Ooze teamed with tiny feet
And world of tied up memories
You left before I got to you
You left before I got to you
You left before I
You left before I
Took the flowers from your hand
Bowed to me and kissed my hand
Did before I, did before I
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do

Follow me, follow me, yeah let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea, yeah, let's go
Out beyond the water's edge
Far out past the coral ledge
Underneath the diamond dancing lights
Chase the world from far below
Silent sleeping indigo
Drifting down into the endless night
I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call
Take my hand, take my hand, yeah take my hand
Follow me, follow me, yeah, let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea, yeah, let's go
Leaving reason far behind
Nothing here is cruel or kind
Only your desire to set me free
Let us lie here all alone
Worn away like river stone
Let us be the sirens of the sea
I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call
Leaving reason far behind
Nothing here is cruel or kind
Only your desire to set me free
Let us lie here all alone
Worn away like river stone
Let us be the sirens of the sea
I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call
Sirens of the sea

Should you hear somebody cry,
"The end is nigh",
Don't you buy that line.
Tomorrow's always yesterday
Love's yet to have it's day and you've got all the time
Planes crashing, trains crashing people dropping bombs,
Nothing new, what go come around now
Child it won't be long.
Keep keeping up,
Everything will be alright tomorrow
Keep keeping
Hey you yeah you don't let it get to you, stressing you
It's what they want you to do,
Smile a while even though it hurts
Even though it hurts
Come on let them know they'll be no breaking you
Love's gonna come around again,
And again and again and on,
Nothing new that go come around now
Child it won't be long.
Keep keeping up,
Everything will be alright tomorrow
Keep keeping

I saw all the tragedies
Happened to mankind
I am always involved
When trouble hits our life
It's not me to turn the fate
To a better end
What I do will make it worse
So, I stopped interfering
I'm a tragic hero
In this game called life
My chances go to zero
I always will survive
I'm a tragic hero
In this game called life
My chances go to zero
I always will survive
I saw all the great disasters
All over the world
I can only observe
But never interact
It's not on me to turn the fate
To a better end
What I do will make it worse
So, I stopped interfering
I'm a tragic hero
In this game called life
My chances go to zero
I always will survive
I'm a tragic hero
In this game called life
My chances go to zero
I always will survive
Watch out for me and be aware
Now trouble is ahead
Try to avoid my company
So, you will be safe
It's not me to turn the fate
To a better end
What I do will make it worse
So, I stopped interfering
I'm a tragic hero
In this game called life
My chances go to zero
I always will survive
I'm a tragic hero
In this game called life
My chances go to zero
I always will survive

Standing so tall / The ground behind
No trespassers / On every floor
A garden swing / And another door
She makes it clear / That everything is hers
A place of abode
Not far from here
Ms. Van de Veer
All that belongs to / No-one sees
Curtains that waver / When evening falls
Inclosed by fences / Smothered by wood
Who stands behind / The shadows of the trees
A place of abode
Not far from here
Ms. Van de Veer

A wa do dem a wa do dem dem dem
A me nuh know a me nuh know

Gung ho, me really love her so
Me love fe see her wey she walk and pose
Fancy rose to match her clothes
Gung ho, fi mi virgin girl
Me love fe see her when her hair fulla curl
Anywhere she go people love her in the world
She don' worship diamond, she don' worship pearl

That has to be the age of overcome
The systems which are on the ceiling
Which are on the run to destroy
Human kind's nation
Human kind's inwardness
Human kind's ability
What for me is a true capital
And which is a side effect
Last not least destroys the nature and us

Stubborn in the bones you tell your mother
Siphon all the life inside away
Take it all to bedtime with another
There ain't no better place than yesterday
I don't wanna show you where the fun is
The market's only good for one more try
Holding to the backdrift of your money
The winter of the words can't stay alive
Streets or guns inside the hands of all your birds
and Tyranny is often found within your words
Do you want me, do you want me here at all
I'm bound to notice when your back's against the wall
You
You stutter in your sleep
You're laughin' while you weep
Will make us all regret
the weekend
You
Wallow in the mud
And revel in your blood
You're bringing down the
worldwide standards
Focus on the capture and retrieval
Of everything you once knew to be yours
Stop and reassure yourself of evil
And struggle to believe you're at my door
Knock until the planets close their eyelids
Wait until the nighttime stars arise
You can see your headspace is divided
And though you've got the tears
The attitude still comes as a surprise
Streets or guns inside the hands of all your birds
and Tyranny is often found within your words
Do you want me, do you want me here at all
I'm bound to notice when your back's against the wall
You
Stutter in your sleep
Your laughin' while you weep
Will make us all regret
the weekend
You
Wallow in the mud
And revel in your blood
You're ringing down the
worldwide standards
You
You call yourself a freak
I know it all looks bleak
but you surround me with
the passion of the pure
You
You really can't decide
You multiply divide
Subtract and add it back
You haven't moved at all(x4)
She's always shining
'cause it's always night
You're always dancing
and the song's so right
Well, do you want me, do you want me
here at all
It seems to me you've got your back against the wall
And it all
goes back to that moment when you
looked her in the eyes
and it
keeps on showing the same thing
but you don't apologize
Well you know that she's your home now
and you're caught inside her snare
With the noose knotted around your neck
and your hands up in her hair
Do you want me, do you want me here at all
I'm bound to notice when your back's against the wall

You think you're denying me of something
Well I've got plenty
You're the one who's missing out
But you won't notice
'Til after five years
If you'll live that long
You'll wake up
All loveless
I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms
I'm so bored with cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle
You can't handle love
You can't handle love
You just can't handle
I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms
What's so scary
Not a threat in sight
You just can't handle
You can't handle love
You can't handle love, baby
You can't handle love
It's obvious
You can't handle
I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms
I'm so bored of cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle
You can't handle love, baby
You can't handle love

You can't handle
I dare you, I dare you

Me and Bobby D don't get along that easily
You told the world, "Be free, love life"
Tell me, is it true you beat your wife?
You see, me and Bobby D don't get along that easily
You told the world, "Skip rules fave fun"
Knocked her from here to kingdom come?
How many girls have you had today?
And how many bottles have you downed today?
And while you're on the skids, who's minding the kids?
Go to sleep Bobby D, here's a kiss
Don't worry your pretty head about this
Me and Saint Jack K never had too much to say
It's easy driving with your feet
With some good ol' girl in the passenger seat
Watching the road all day
"Oh honey, what funny things you do say"
But while you're out of your head
Who's making the bed?
Go to sleep Bobby D, here's a kiss
Don't worry your pretty head about this
Go to sleep Saint Jack K
Don't worry your tiny head today
Me and old Bobby D don't get along that famously
A savior and a seer? Maybe
But he never meant that much to me
Sure, I'd love a wild life
But every wild man needs a mother or wife
The seven seas you roam
And who's waiting at home?

He's the ugly primadonna,
I don't, he's gone, and I wanna,
Cause even though I know he was beast,
My secret lover has never ceased,
He's the ugly primadonna, (Has he gone, has he gone)
I don't, he's gone, and I wanna, (Carry on, Carry on)
Cause even though I know you think its wrong,
We sorta used to get it on and on and on, (ET said B)
On and on and on (D-O-O-O-D)
And he was talking to me, Yeah (And he was talking to me)
I know that some of you can't understand,
But ET used to be my man,
Cause even though I know you think its wrong,
We sorta used to get it on and on and on,
ET said B (ET said B)
D-O-O-O-D (D-O-O-O-D)
And he was talking to me, Yeah (And he was talking to me)
He's the ugly primadonna,
I don't, he's gone, and I wanna,
Cause even though I know he was beast,
My secret lover has never ceased,

I know just what your mama said
Always misunderstood
Gotta tell you something
I saw it in your eyes
I think I left your back seat
And now It's always good
I fell asleep from day
And all the promises
There's a lot of people
That let their will to say
I've got a lot of friends
And they've got beautiful eyes
That make my heart feel surprised
And you notice it
And that's the truth
That's the truth
Have me to you
I shine along underneath your view
I'll be the one
To let you know when you've come undone

I was moving forward
From the point I've come from
I was rolling lowly
This is our song now
I was moving forward
From the point I've come from
I was rolling lowly
This is our song now
Gotta see it
Nothing means I gotta gotta
Feel it
Everything is out I gotta
Hold out
Everything is out I gotta
Day out
Just invite them
Gotta
Bore them
Till I take us out
I gotta feel like
Every single line
I gotta
Clean it out to the side
When we're not down and out
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Burning down the city
Warning out of something
But I need to find it
'Cause I got no sun down
Dug a whole was so fun
And a taste that's floating
What it doesn't meet no
Place to silent sleep now
I gotta feeling
Doesn't mean I sad because I
Love me
Everything around it isn't
Better
If you sing it loud and I
Jam myself to dawn
I got
So much dissing at the side and
When its
Just another ride and you
Sow yourself to the cat
Bet it
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah)

Bring your head against the wall
So I can see where I will fall
Bring your mind into my head
Find your playing den
All in all it's just a start
All we had was more than that
All in all I can't go back
To where we started out
So bring my head up to Mont Blanc
So you will see what you would find
Bring my head against the wall
So you can see where I will go
All in all it's just your fault
Made me feel respect no more
All in all I can't go back
Blind my mind inside
Bring my mind inside your head
So you can see where I went then
Bring your head against the wall
So I can see where I will fall

I've gone past my borders
I was so sad, I had no color
I've gone past my borders
I was so sad, I had no color
When I started from "csík"

Oh my god what can I do

Irrelevant questions
Queer responses with double meanings
Disordered,
Disorted voices
Coming from distant, dismal polar climes
It makes you feel glad
It makes you take on a new lease of life
It makes you feel glad
It makes you fill the air with your cries

Youll never know Im coming
No youll never see me coming

Youll never know Im there blind
Ill be the man inside you know

Gonna blend in shadows
Never see me coming
Ill be the voice you hear behind
Youll never know Im there blind
Ill be the man inside you know

Feed the Hindu dirty water
With the blood from the sacred cow
And what you gonna feed them now?
200 years without respite
200 years, yeah, we're always gonna fight
And what you gonna feed them now?
From Udam Singh to Lakshmi Bai
Spirit lives on and on
So don't forget what they did to you then
And don't ever let it happen again
Happen again
And now the scars don't hurt so much
And you can forget what you did to us
In this Utopian imperial world
And all the names, the pillages and the pain
From the black
In my eye to the blue in my veins
Spirit lives on and on and on and strong
So hold on to what you are
They'll never steal what you really are

Touch my hand
It's only me, listen
I'm here.
Come to stand
In sultry fields
With you.
And now
Old dummy day
I know
Is over this way.
I'm laughing
Saw you gonna kiss me
You see
Yeah as I said.
One day she won't
A lonely bird
Alone.
Judgment day
Saw the world it's gone
Unheard.
Sold the sea
A lot how it feels to me.
I hate the word it's sad to see
I take your weight
And your heart fades away
Today a renegade
To lay in woods
By the pheasants.
I mean it
You don't
Force on my head
Kill our nightmare.
A lonely bird, a lonely bird
A lonely bird, a lonely bird
A lonely bird, alone.
Color me
Cover me in the color that reminds you
Solemnly.
Could make the same mistake
And you would never know
That I am, that I am
Alone, now.
Something, something
Tells me that you
Have something
On, all of us now
You're heaven
Taking over me now
Color me hate
Raw little nerve
Color me and pull us
Only home
Me home.
Hold the sun down
Hold the sun down
Hold the moon down
Leave me to rest
Want the world man
Too the words out
Only relief is
To slip through the nets
Hold a minute
And stop a minute
And go, oh oh
Hold a minute
You said to me
Said to me and
Breath, breath, breath, breath, breath
You said it to me
Sometime later.

Gazoyngas a plenty! Back pains she had many!
For such knockers hooters funbags boys were not even ready
She could hold your beer! Without hands she could steer!
Smack a grown man in the face so hard he's shed a few tears!
GHOST BOOBS OH YOU HARDLY KNEW ME
GHOST BOOBS OOH WE HARDLY KNEW YE
It was a fad diet! She had to try it!
Chrissy Snow looked pretty hot, so Thighmaster?
Just buy it!
A paid membership at the bulldyke gym
'cause her boyfriend liked Sue Powter so why not impress him?
What she didn't foresee was that her big'uns would flee
Her thighs and gut both stayed the same but she could now see her knees
Her boyfriend he did weep!
He thought her twiddles would keep
But they didn't know that they would come back in her sleep!

We're all dying in the living room
Wait on this life that's not yours
I've been looking in windows
I figure there's one good person on every block
I found only signs of life within these dead end streets
I left my mark with dry erase
So fucking drunk at 3 am
I've been moving, moving
Now I'm anchored, anchored
Drowning in options
I'm going to war
With couches and routine
And myself
All these cities I should have never left
All the times I shouldn't have let you wait up on me
I left my mark with dry erase
So fucking drunk at 3 am
I've been walking, walking
In my sleep
Drowning in options
We're all dying in the living room
Wait on this life that's not yours
I've been breathing under open skies
Keep moving because it feels so right

Bored with your body and tired of my mind
Bored with the future and bored with my past
I need something stronger
Bored with your body and tired of my mind
Bored with your future and bored with my past
Real life get thee behind...
I need something stronger
(sounds like "we can fuck..")
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Gonna make everything inside your head move
Gonna make you scream, gonna make you dream
Gonna take everything to the extreme
I need something stronger
I who know history am doomed to repeat it
Again and again and again
I need something stronger
Fire me to raptures of crazy boredom
Bored with your body and tired of my mind
Real life get thee behind...
I need something stronger
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Gonna make everything inside your head move
Gonna make you screm, gonna make you dream
Gonna take everything to the extreme
I need something stronger

Yes, no, maybe is all I need to hear from you
If things go crazy, she's lost herself and lost to you
Now that nothings spoken, she's out there on the ice again
She's breaking down slowly, colliding as she holds your hand
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
Yes, no, maybe is all I need to hear from you
If things go crazy, she's lost herself and lost to you
Now that nothings spoken, she's out there on the ice again
She's take me down slowly, she's holding on to what she can
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
If that's what it takes, then don't let it tear us apart
Even if it breaks your heart
If that's what it takes, then don't let it tear us apart
Even if it breaks your heart
Even if it breaks your heart
Even if it breaks your heart

Through the clitoris it goes
Your mammary glands, I'll split into two
Blocking the entrance to the eternal opening
Of the urine tube - infernal vaginal bleeding
Eyes they stare as limbs and bones are crushed
I'm the bonebreaker of Jehovah
Through the clitoris it goes
Your mammary glands, I'll split into two
Blocking the entrance to the eternal opening
Of the urine tube - infernal vaginal bleeding
Your lilywhote lips I grease with seminal fluids
Pierce them with needles, makes them liver gray
Out of the urine tube, urine and blood gushes out
Alike a colorful rainbow stream
With my tongue sharp as razor I cut and cut
Not unlike a drill I much and lick
Eyes they stare as limbs and bones are crushed
I'm the bonebreaker of Jehovah
Through the clitoris it goes
Your mammary glands, I'll split into two
Blocking the entrance to the eternal opening
Of the urine tube - infernal vaginal bleeding
I can't hide my misery
I know my sorrow can't set me free
She did it to me

Here we are
Stuck by this river
You and I
Underneath a sky that's ever falling down, down, down
Ever falling down
Through the day
As if on an ocean
Waiting here
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
I wonder why we came
You talk to me
As if from a distance
And I reply
With impressions chosen from another time, time, time
From another time

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you (oh yeah)
Don't you know it's true
Girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you (oh yeah)
Don't you know it's true

Would I lie to you, baby, yeah

We got the horses moving
We got the woofers grooving
We got the Waylon wailing
Everybody's head is bobbin
I got the muffler flowing
I got my horn a-blowing
I got the rubber burning
Down on all fours
Pull in the club
We hear the band bang
Roll through the door
Everybody hey, hey's
Four on the floor
Feel the beat in your soul
Moving to the rhythm
Pumping til ya cant take no more
Dance if you want to
Do what you came to
You cant ignore the feeling
Of that four on the floor
DJ is really wigging
He got the old school mixing
The fellas heads are spinning
All the girls are finger-licking
We got the bubbly bubbling
I got her shoulders rubbing
I got my game spinning
Kicking it in low
She grabs my arm
Pulls me to the main stage
Out on the floor
Everybody sing sing
Four on the floor
Feel the beat in your soul
Moving to the rhythm
Pumping til ya cant take no more
Take a little walk outside
Honey wants to see my ride
You know I think I might
Turn on a little Barry White

Here I am lord and I?m drowning, in your sea of forgetfulness
The chains of yesterday surround me, I yearn for peace and rest
I don't want to end up where you found me
And it echoes in my mind
Keeps me awake tonight
I know you've cast my sin as far as the east is from the west
And I stand before you now as though I've never sinned
But today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From you leaving me this way
Jesus can you show me just how far the east is from the west
'cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again
In the arms of your mercy I find rest
'cause you know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other
I start the day, the war begins
Endless reminding of my sin
And time and time again
Your truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in
Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From you leaving me this way
I know you've washed me white
Turn my darkness into life
I need your peace to get me through
To get me through this night
I can't live by what I feel
About the truth your word reveals
I'm not holding on to you
But you're holding on to me
You're holding on to me

Foot soldier
March ahead
Enter the unknown
You will take the first step
Foot soldier
Blindfolded
You're babystepping
Carefully treading
Blindfolded
Tread carefully
Conquer the darkness
Into the darkness
Foot soldier
And then we'll follow
But you go first
March ahead
But you go first
Foot soldier
March ahead
Foot soldier
Who will take the first step

I woke under cover of darkness
Looked up into the television sky
Tonight
I wandered through the city alone this
Rain wouldn't stop I couldn't dry my eyes
I cried
Who is the one to blame
Why is it that you never say
When the feeling leaves
If you're through with me
As I'm walking through the rain
Cold tears falling down my face
Like the autumn leaves
On a windy day
I went out to the edge of town
Over bright highways where the traffic was the only sound
Around
While my eyes were looking at the ground
I could see pictures of you floating all around
I didn't doubt

Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
I know we had our ups and downs
At times I would act like the clown
But I never really knew you
I never really had a clue
I would always be the kind of guy
Who ran around for you cause that was fine
That wasn't enough for you
I never did the best I could
So leaving me was your first step
Now you try to move on and forget
Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
Cause you'll get the blame
You're part of her game
Get's one up
It's such a shame, shame, shame, shame, shame , shame
You only call me up when you're alone
Not expecting my engaged tone
But this is what's meant to be
You're falling down away from me
Now my silence speaks a thousand words
You tore my world apart
But you never really heard
All the tears you made me cry
Now it's time to say goodbye
And leaving you behind is my first step
Now I'll try to move on and forget
Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
Cause you'll get the blame
You're part of her game
Get's one up
It's such a shame, shame, shame, shame
Confusion girl
You're under her spell
But you won't know til the very end
This trick was just pretend
Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
Cause you'll get the blame
You're part of her game
Get's one up
It's such a shame, shame, shame, shame, shame
Anything but herself.

Drifting out of time
Something on your mind
And I wanna be the one that you
Call when you get down
No matter where you are in the
World I'll be around
Fly me away on an aeroplane
High in the sky
Wanna see you again
Wanna know this time
Gonna tell you what I'm feeling
Gonna know this time
Gonna get it back that feeling
Miles and miles of sun
Endless roads twist on
Don't wanna live a life in
A world that's all the same
The crazy little things that
You do are so magical
This crazy life
This crazy world
We're living in is magical

Chor.
God lift us up where we belong far by the clouds of our new home and we know it wont be long gods childern will be going home
Vers. 1
Well Steven was stoned there that day fell upon his knees & prayed Failed to sleep in the arms of God, God lift him up where he belonged far by the clouds of his new home
Repeat Chors.
Vers. 2
Well Jesus spoke the words of Lazathes that day and now death did'nt have no power against the tru and the living god and i'll always stand for jesus while were on this earth
Repeat Chors.
Keep looking up you'll see your home

I don't want to date a boy
and I don't want a dog
I don't have to need
to belong in your world
but from time to time I'll burn a candle
for the hell of it
I'll say a prayer
and I'll bark a bit
little danger between you and me
And I could pretend
I'm not insane
and I could pretend
to be so great
I don't want to lie
I don't like cars
Believe me I'm just fine
with red wine and catnip
but from time to time
a double vision
I'm paying for the tabs
You do the driving
and I'll do the cab
look inside me
only cats
And I could pretend
I'm not insane
and I could pretend
to be so great
jump off with me
off the cliff
clouds burst
clouds burst
what do I deserve
what do you deserve
fall in love
fall in love
I could bring you some joy
and make you happy, could make you more
I could fight for human rights
clean the length of human kind
can you get my friend to clean my dirty mind
what are we looking for?
I don't want to get high, I want to score
endless days and hot summer nights
can you get my friend to clean my dirty mind
And I could pretend
I'm not insane
and I could pretend
to be so fucking great
to be so fucking great
to be fucking great
jump off with me
off the cliff
clouds burst
heads burst
what do I deserve
what do you deserve
fall in love
fall in love

Lonelyville
The name of my town is Lonelyville
Nobody down in Lonelyville
Nobody here but me
Lonelyville
I'm spending my nights in Lonelyville
Seeing the sights in Lonelyville
But nothing's here to see
Population of three
Just me, myself, and I
So if you happen to be passing by
Lonelyville
Don't let me stay here in Lonelyville
Not one more day here in Lonelyville
How I want to go
Back to where I know
I will never be lonely

Late summer night
Painted purple
Storms from the right
Words that hurtle
Lips curl to fight
Eyes are startled
Blood from the bite
Seems to sparkle
Now is the time
It's too late to fly
Hurting just to hurt
No silver light to brighten
Clouds in our sight
Now is the time
It's too late to fly
I must try to stop this downpour and clear the skies

You'll never know
Only my soul
Bares the truth
Cares for you
Only my soul
You'll never see
Stays here with me
Overload, nothing more
Only my soul
Knew you were ready
Because you had no answers for me
Take me back to where love grows
I don't want to be here anymore

I get down to the sound of getting down
Slow and heavy
Woman hug me
But, I find the beauty
Baby this is music yeah
I'll do the things you're scared to think about
When everybody's watching
Your arms around me
I get down to the sound of getting down
I like this flavor
I want it to linger ye-eah
Exotic possibilities
And baby we are music yeah
I'll do the things you're scared to think about
and everybody's watching
You're all surrounded
I'll do the things you only dream about
Everybody's watching your arms around me
And if you stay!
I'll take care of you
I am here to comfort you
Anything you want me too
I can't complain!
You're so lovely yeah
All you really gotta do
Is enjoy me

Slow and heavy yeah

House on the ground, bass in your face,
Racin' the place, no time to waste.
Feelin' hypnotised,

Feelin' kinda better,

Name here is Ray, the group is 2 Unlimited,
We've got a lot to say to you, ah yeah and your other crew, if it is
A
Dream, boom see boom!

People come and people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by
Seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember
Never been one to give my heart up so easily
But now you're gone wish I'd given my heart completely
In the touch of a stranger I can feel you
In the eyes of a child I see your face
Your hold on my soul
Keeps me from danger
No matter how hard I try
These memories I can't erase
People come and people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by
Seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember
In the brush of a stranger I can feel you
In the eyes of a child I see your face
Your hold on my soul
Keeps me from danger
No matter how hard I try
These memories I can't replace.

Please please please
Won't you give your love to me?
Are you gonna give me your love
Love will treat you
You got to live
You got to die
So what's the purpose of you and I
You want some passion
You can receive
And it ain't no question
In this I believe

While girl been pimping hyping up
You got bills in stock keep lining up

Let you breath that paper don't settle us
Getting twenties if the eighteens ain't fat enough
Nice little cutie just backs it up
Tell a gal to keep her eyes off you stuff
Rude girl a you posses the Midas touch
From head to toe Buju say them fabulous
And love it when the woman them gorgeous
No other thing on this earth I would rather trust
Tell all the woman then it is a must
Verse 2
Now who you gonna play
Low down dirty shame

Losing a tricky game
Just look at your hair
While checking out your nails
Tens less I am stress less loving you everyway
Benjy in the air so let it blaze
Costume ain't anything so baby lets the blazer stay
A magnetic force pulling me to the stare
Irresistible there is no escape

And the Hog of the Forsaken got no reason to cry,
He got to chew the angels fallin' from on hiiigh,
He ain't waitin' for no answers, bakin' woeful pie,
Pie of eyesight, pie boot-black, oh that pie,
The pie of by-and-by.
And the Hog of the Forsaken he ain't like you and I,
With bones always breakin' and no place to go an' lie,
He's in the box so dark and wet, he got so much time,
He ain't even worried yet, the Hog of the Forsaken,
He is the Pork of Crime.
And the Hog of the Forsaken, he'll leave you one more chance,
Which, if you won't be takin' he'll leave it for the ants,
He sings out in the wilderness, he sings of friend and foe,
He sings of these and those times as well as the times to go.
And the Hog of the Forsaken he swims out into the sea,
Finds the alligator gar chase the leapin' mullet,
And chokes the water hyacinth flowin' to the sea,
The Hog of the Forsaken, he is the hog for me!

I met your boyfriend on St. Martin's Lane
And he said, "Fancy running into you again".
We talked a minute or so, then he turned to go,
And I walked into the crowd again.
And the morning was a different place,
In every passerby I saw your face.
Love leaves a lonely ghost,
With one thought uppermost
Is this the case in every case?
Am I walking to you?
Am I walking to you?
In everything I do,
Am I just walking to you?
It was seven years ago to the day,
You rang my house and we met halfway.
We walked round Leicester Square and
Sat through 'Being There' and every moment I replay.
And I was desperate for love to be pure,
Though what that meant, I never was sure.
You spent your time on me,
I took it willingly,
And I made you trust in literature.
Am I walking to you?
Am I walking to you?
In everything I do,
Am I just walking to you?
I just don't know what to do.

In my world of sleepers
Everything will be erased
I'll be your religion
Only endless ideal
Slowly crawl in the dark
Swallowed by the seductive night
My torch has burned out

Here's my genius plan
To make superior man
Anatomically built
This half corpse can't guilt
Say goodbye
To your incest eyes
Blue blood
Say why shattered glass
Makes shattered ribs
Never heard when it's time to guilt
Until the bottom of winter blues
You're my teacup passing by
Doctor dead
And his kids
Oh, how awful it was today
The sounds of screaming
Save us please
Open wounds
Drowned in Kerosene
What the fuck is this?
Oh, it's the bass
So, what do you think of me?
Is it a joke
Or a part of me?
Yeah,
I'm just saying
May your face
Minimize the human race
This way we can be together
Make threats to switchblade lovers
Okay baby
It's been so long
Since the cityscape had episodes

(Instrumental)
A whistler on the subway
Remind me that tune
I heard the first time
Around that time I fell in love with you
A picture in the paper
Of buildings in that town
Where we spend our heathen honeymoon
And tears come running down
Signalling what I have been denying for too long
I have not and I will never move on
The books of the 1920s
Of lovers torn by war
Engages, moves, and touches me
Telling me I (?openly)
Never was I drafted
I chose that for myself
As you went on to find love
With many other men
And it is only now that I begin to understand
What I carelessly let slip out of my hand
I thoguht I could find another you
But there is only one
And I only dare to tell you this in song
I have not and I will
Never move on

I la la la love my, I love my
I love my, I love I love my life
So I took a moment and I pictured you with someone else
Ain't gonna lie I got beside myself
A product of your daddy's wealth
So blessed, I can't imagine life without you
Real talk your nothing short of magical
And I agree it's beautiful
You see the good in every soul
And I think I love you
Yeah I do
My girl is cray
She got money in the bank
Digs the music that I make
Sing it, I love I love my life
My girl is dope, Louis Vuitton's and Prada coat
Get that booty, shared a smoke
Singin I love I love my life
I Iove my I love my
I love I love my life
So I like I've been thinking about the time
that we stayed up all night
Makin' love me gusta candle light
You were so young rich and full of life
Next night had everbody singin' the blues
All dressed up, dancing like fools
Break out the Martin Auvich jewels
We livin and dreamin,
Just stick with what we do to shine
My girl is cray
She got money in the bank
Digs the music that I make
Sing it, I love I love my life
My girl is dope, Louis Vuitton's and Prada coat
Get that booty, shared a smoke
Singin I love I love my life
I Iove my I love my life
She's got long legs and lashes, my chic's so attractive
Makes you wonder why she's running with a dude like me
And behind me yeah you can confide
Like your Louis V, I'll never leave your side
So you're wild and fearless
I'll give you all of me
I'll show you things you'd never thought you'd see
You're wild and free, oh oh oh...
My girl is cray
She got money in the bank
Digs the music that I make
Sing it, I love I love my life
My girl is dope, Louis Vuitton's and Prada coat
Get that booty, shared a smoke
Singin I love I love my life
I Iove my I love my life
She's got long legs and lashes, my chic's so attractive
Makes you wonder why she's running with a dude like me
I love I love my life
I Iove my I love my

Choosing
Losing
Finding my way throught the rain
Losing
Choosing
All of my thoughts go insane
Choosing
Losing
Finding my way throught the rain
Losing
Choosing
All of my thoughts go insane
And I can't go
Where I want to
And I can't go
Where I want to
Choosing
Losing
Finding my way throught the rain
Losing
Choosing
All of my thoughts go insane
Finding my way through this lonely place
It's just a rainy daze
Finding my way through this lonely days
It's such a rainy place
And I can't go
Where I want to
And I can't go
Where I want to
Who would dare to bring me love
Who would dare to bring me love
Who would dare to bring me love
Who would dare to bring me love

An open road, foot to the floor
Kind of love
A cutters to the cage, flight of the dove kind of love
Cliche fulfilled, candle lit
You spin around to some poppy shit
I think this is it. This is it.
Watching your drunken stepped pirouettes
Made me think a thought I haven't thought of yet:
I have no regrets. No regrets

We came out from the deep
To learn to love, to learn how to live
We came out from the deep
To avoid the mistake we made
That's why we are here!
We came out from the deep
To help and understand, but not to kill
It takes many lives till we succeed
To clear the debts of many hundres years
That's why we are here!

Oh Oh Oh
Everyone looking for something
Anything they can believe in
Without searching in their hearts
oh
Everyone wanna be loved by all
before they catch you in the fall
For they shelter you from the rain
oh
All the People
Everyone with soul (?)
Reach out to someone it's cold and lonely
Cold and Lonely
Oh oh
All the people
Everyone with soul (?)
Reach out to someone it's cold and lonely
Cold and Lonely
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

A dream finally came true
To wear this special uniform
To join in their company
The best of the best
Always been a believer
In your own capacity
The training never was too hard
No one could break you
Reach out for the stars
Your strong will got you here
You walked a stony way
Without the slightest sign of fear
We're starfighters, fly all day and all night
And all that we see is our cockpit light
We're starfighters and we love it so much
It's our obsession, we have the master's touch

You make it look so easy to pretend
That all we ever was, was friends
You twisted every word I ever said
You made me say the things that I might regret
When I've given you everything that I should
I've given you everything that I could
You make it look so easy to forget
Loving you is a journey that never ends
An I've given you everything that I should
I've given you everything that I could
That I should
So you want my love and have it your own way
So come on, come on, come on now
Now matter how I try I just cant walk away
But I'm giving you everything that I should
Given you everything that I could
When I'm giving everything that I should
I'm given you everything that I could
That I could
That I could
So could I let you down was I not your sound
So want my love and have it your own way
So come on, come on, come on now
An now matter how I try I just cant walk away
An I'm giving you everything that I should
Given you everything that I could
An I'm giving you everything that I should
Given you everything that I could
That I could
That I could

Boyfriend
Be be boyfriend
Boyfriend boyfriend
Boyfriend
So you gotta gotta boy right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
'cause I know we could maybe, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair
It's so more hard when I'm not right here with you
You make me do things, I don't want to do
You call me in and I know there's so much more
Why do you pick me up to kick me to the floor
So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
'cause I know maybe we could maybe, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair
I go to clubs
You go to clubs to
But my friends tell me that I don't have a clue
So you can give me one the next time I'm out
So I got something to scream and shout like
So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
I know maybe we could, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair
So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
I know maybe we could, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair
We could share, air, air
Now I wonder, why this way
I don't know where you really strayed
And your empty touch
Fractures all of my skin
How happy I could be with the one without you in
So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
I know maybe we could, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair
Gotta boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there

Well you know,
Id love to be a shick on speed
Running every morning
Over blonde German faces
And shave, just shave
If I was a shick on pills
Id go in a discotheque
Run over dancefloor maces
And shave, shave again
Nice to be a shick on stick
Laying every morning
On the patchwork blanket on my bed
And shave and shave and shave
Now I am a shick on spleen
Cutting every morning
All my legs, all my head
Born to shave, only shave

[Chorus]
Riding with the top down through the valley
Real ones all around me
Got the west coast chick from Cali
Rolling up something cloudy
Let your hair down
Feel the sunshine
All the bad days gonna disappear
We out of here
We out here
[Post Chorus]
We out of here
We out here
We out of here
We out here

His life was a breeze
Just one thing left to appease
Wanna give that bottle a squeeze
and look just like Charlize?
But these times are so hard
Must do more than lay in the yard
To look like a Belize postcard
or a reality star
But this story's tragic
You don't turn orange by magic
You could do it solar like Rick
or stick your ass in a thick
tank full of darque waves 'cause it's the latest craze
Do it for forty days,
get accused of wearing blackface-oh!
DARQUE TAN, HE'S A FAN! DARQUE TAN, NO MORE WAN!! DARQUE TAN, IT"S HIS PLAN!!! DARQUE TAN, CHILDREN RAN!!!!
I knew it was a bad idea when he got into that bed
I never knew it would come to this
'til he looked at me and said
I wanna get a tan! Uh-uh!!
I wanna get a tan!! Bad idea!!!
I wanna get a tan!!! I don't think so!!!!
I wanna get a tan!!!! TOO SCARY!!!!
(Repeat chorus)
And now he's dead,
I'll never see him again
He turned orange, then he turned red
No one wins in the end
Then he died,
his face was fried
In the booth all that's left is a tooth
He turned red,
then he turned dead
Listen and learn...or you, too, will be burned.

Music response [Repeat: x 5]
Music that triggers some kind of response

Music that triggers some kind of response

I sing a song
For the sad ones like you
But you don't hear
What is wrong what is true
My shadows
I can't hear your heartbeat
Your narrow mind
Takes the air that I need
I have to fight
For air
But I breathe no longer
Life is what you want it
No no no you cannot close the door
Yes yes yes I fly away for sure
My my my answer is my faithful pride
And you and you should vanish
You should go
You better listen
The words that you read
Your eyes should close
And pray for the key
It's out of reach
And I give gold give everything
Your looks ignite
Your voice is a mess
Your smell of perfume
Should make you regret
You are a loser
And you are made for failing
No no no......
The face I see
In the mirror, it's yours
But I am also
A part of it all
You cannot hide me
Because I am the best you've got
I start to feel
Ashamed when you walk
You talk about
The rules of our life
But I'm no loser
And I am made to save you
No no no..

I wanna hold your hands tonight
I wanna walk you home from school
I wanna take you on a date
I wanna treat you like a fool
Now dont you worry about me
New romantic
I wouldnt worry 'less she'll agree
I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna squeeze you good and tight
I wanna fly you to the moon
I want to dance with you all night
Now dont you worry about me
New romantic
My good intention, you'll see, is authentic
Caus I know loving aint easy
Although its easy on the eyes
Both when appalling and pleasing
Love is alright
Take me on, Amarillion
Take on me, Amarillion
I wanna hold your hands tonight
(Must have been something she said)
I wanna walk you home from school
(Ch-ch-changes)
I wanna take you on a date
(Cut away thoughts with the one armed scissor)
I want to treat you like a fool
(Hes gonna treat her mean and cool)
Now dont you worry about me
New romantic
My good intention, you'll see, is authentic.
Caus I know loving aint easy
Although its easy on the eyes
Both when appalling and pleasing
Love is alright
Take me on, Amarillion
Take on me, Amarillion
Take me out, Amarillion
Take me in, Amarillion

I've got a cure for the system
It's got a killer disease
It's got every one
down on their knees
It's a terrible answer
but it assumes all we need
are we programmed zombies
who can't even think?
everyone's turning Psychobot
but no one even cares
everyone's turning but we're not
trapped in the cure
psychobot

I touched his hand
Burned like coal
Put pay to the devil
And saw the mountain fall
Feel like crying
The jokes gone to far
You can be anything you want
Every color you are
Family man
His patience tried
Put a torch to his home
And warmed his hands by the fire
The greed of desire
My roads uncrossed
White lined and tarred
By believing in you
Every color you are

HOOK 2x:
Come with me, Christ Jesus brother
Run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna live or die?
VERSE:
I ain't a sinner I'm a Christian
I keep my mind on Christ stay far from religion
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the realest in this rap game, believe it (Bow Down)
Pray to God on my knees knowing that he's listening
This world is reversed, They should be asking for opinion
Now pay attention, bless me father please I need your peace
Cause your love is so divine that is so simple and kind
Im bout to take that ride. you should come with me
Believe me, there aint nothing clear as you can see
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a freeman who saves
That's Jesus, My Savior, The Genius
My Mayor this world is possessed by demons
The sin virus is all over our feelings, no stress
It's a mess, ain't nothing left..except Christ Jesus
When are you gonna make a move to impress Christ Jesus?
HOOK 2x:
Come with me, Christ Jesus brother
Run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna live or die?
VERSE 2:
Brothers Im packed before Christ comes back
Never realized the precious time to receive some snack
Would you rather live in fear or certainty
Wipe out your tears cause Christ is the keyI guarantee!
You only got one life to live so depend on god
Start doing the good and stop the odd
Don't gain it all and still lose your soul
You need a mind control. To make you whole again
Like a Christian in a real life rolling man
Raise heaven to this real thing, praising him
One way, one trip, moving straight like a bullet
I let nothing come my way, Christ SideGet it!
To my Gisciples, my homeboys riding it!
Fighting and never give up, thats the truth aint it
Ill keep my head up for C, get your eyes off me
We aint quitting or crying, now walk with me brother!
HOOK 2x:
Come with me, Christ Jesus brother
Run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna live or die?
VERSE 3:
Since my family run these streets, like these Jesus freaks
I praise God for the church and the vision I seek
Meek as a mouse stead of sneaking around spying, it aint a technique of the way I speak
Its an everyday news but you gotta choose, to live for God or to die and lose
Hold your head and stay up for the nasty streets
Theres only one way up dealing with faith and peace
BRIDGE 2x:
If its on then its on, we break bad-breaks
Christ Jesus on my side, we wont lose that take
For the things I dont got, be the things I gotta take
Dealing with faith, Mighty God wont close the gate
HOOK 2x:
Come with me, Christ Jesus brother
Run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna live or die?

Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday dear Richard,
Happy birthday to you.
Hah-hah-hah.
Happy birthday my little son - my little 28-year-old son!
Well, you were born by now, because you were born about five o'clock in the morning.
Er... you'll have a lovely day. I hope your card came.

I want the view from the top of the hill
Give me the view from the top of the hill
When I think of you
And your good life
And your sorrow too
How much I'm missing you
No matter where I go
Or where I come to stay
This is waking up
I want this feeling
Doors wide open
And now I leave it all
Bags of trouble
And a messy mind
Oh I hope I find
Where your load is light
Where your heart's at ease
This is waking up
And feeling good, feeling good
Hey, I'm making my mistakes
'Cause I'm no great shakes at being perfect
I just take my breaks and work it
Bring it to the surface
Like a scuba diver
Never nervous
Cause now I'm older and wiser
An' I've a bold feelin'
This old skin is peeln'
Revealing a new layer
I'm no soothsayer
But I feel it's time to leave
To polish my heart with the other sleeve
I want the view from the top of the hill
Give me the view from the top of the hill
I want the view from the top of the hill
Give me the view from the top of the hill
And feeling good, feeling good

There were buildings here long ago
But now the blade of grass cuts my feet
I proceed with caution and lay low
Just visible through the trees
Breathing carefully I crawl up
Onto the surface of tension
I glimpse the rocks from below
What I see will never be mentioned
Dizzy with wonder
I shake my head to clear the view
With a hunger to know
I come to this place to be close to you
Lit from inside
I go to the switch
I rise quickly from the dark
Through white clouds that I tear apart
Releasing drops of water
All over
Dizzy with wonder
I shake my head to clear the view
With a hunger to know
I come to this place to be close to you
Dizzy with wonder
I shake my head to clear the view
With a hunger to know
I come to this place to be close to you
Dizzy with wonder
I shake my head to clear the view
With a hunger to know
I come to this place to be close to you
Dizzy with wonder
I shake my head to clear the view
With a hunger to know
I come to this place to be close to you

Brave girl replies
When you come back, I'll be gone
Read off her rules,
When in control I move on
Thoughtful or sad,
No need to ask
You in her eyes a sister someone
Who's been where
She's roaming now
Flashes of home
And people there
Pressured caught up she feels,
Measured all up revealed
I still haven't walked my distance
I'm not ready to return
Independent on my way to become I
Sunday no sign,
Why did I meke you meet me here?
No cause for doubt,
But feeling sustains
When mix up clears
Easy and loose,
Unsure confused
It doesn't take much to knock me
I've been living a sheltered life

When the little guns come
And they wanna bust guns
And they run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son
When the little guns come
And they wanna bust guns
And they run when I come with that warrior song

Show me forgiveness
For having lost faith in myself
And let my own interior up
To inferior forces
The shame is endless
But if soon start forgiveness
The girl might live

It's been raining
Hundred days, thousand nights
It's cold when I awake
No more light
To a sky, without a moon
I heard you say
See you soon
Kali came, she took away
Said it had to die
So it could grow again
If you don't wake up
You'll be on the stars
Throw them down
To me
Wherever you are

Caught between
The Earth and the sky
What too long
And what too high
Fallen free and holding on
Nothing there at all
Dropped and lifted
Gotta breathe
Bottom drifting
On the way
Holding just a few poor words
And nothing at all
Reaching out
To still the sand
No light connects
The breaking moments
Drifting to another shore
There's nothing here
That I could change at all
Nothing at all
Forced to be
A broken line
Let to hold
What we could find
Then to learn
And go again
Nothing sorted out

[Verse 1]
You came off, you scared to fall
And you came off, keep on the armour every time
It's one hell of a performance
You came off, just keep the same there at the try
I can't fix you if you're broken
If you can't crawl then you can't teach me how to fly
I'm uncertain, I'm hoping
If they ask me, I still tell 'em that you're mine
[Chorus]
We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna fall in
It gets hard to dive and I
We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna call it
I still wanna try and I
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
[Verse 2]
You can't blind me with your conscience
I gets harder to see the fear in your eyes
We can both win if you coming
It's as easy as pretending that we're blind
Never said I can't, never said I won't
So hard when there's a doubt
And we're drowning, we wanna be free
Hardest when you're having doubts
[Chorus]
We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna fall in
It gets hard to dive and I
We don't wanna fight, we don't wanna call it
I still wanna try and I
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down
Could this be us?
Are we running from the same ghost?
Could this be us?
And we fall before the flame goes down

Beetles into my carpet
Under my feet
They come out in the heat
Beetles into my carpet
Under my feet
They come out in the heat
Beetles into my carpet
Under my feet
They come out in the heat
Beetles into my carpet
Under my feet
They come out in the heat

Sometimes the day won't ever end
Sometimes you just throw up your hands
It's the little things sometimes
Sometimes the world has just gone dark
Sometimes you're praying for a spark
It's the little things sometimes
But if you lift your eyes
See it in a different light
Just a cloud up in the open sky
Let the rain, fall away
Cause today is beautiful
Lift your eyes
See it in a different light
Just a cloud up in the open sky
Let the rain, fall away
Cause today is beautiful
Right now it feels so hard to breath
Right now you're asking God why me
It's what you can see right now
Cause right now there's a greater truth
Right now there's a bigger view
Than what you can see right now
But if you lift your eyes
See it in a different light
Just a cloud up in the open sky
Let the rain, fall away
Cause today is beautiful
Lift your eyes
See it in a different light
Just a cloud up in the open sky
Let the rain, fall away
Cause today is beautiful
If you see more than what's in front of you
You might see more of heaven's view
If you see more than what's in front of you
You might see more of heaven's view
So lift your eyes
See it in a different light
Just a cloud up in the open sky
Let the rain, fall away
Cause today is beautiful
Lift your eyes
See it in a different light
Just a cloud up in the open sky
Let the rain, fall away
Cause today is beautiful

Nowadays things aren't always what they seem
Even in my widest dreams i couldn''t have you
Things you say always make ma go insane
Wondering if i am the blame it's a shame
You're gonna love me someday
Better make sure it's not too late
Every night i sit down and think about
Why i never had a doubt about us
But, I was wrong thinking our love was strong
Thinking we could still hold on, but it's gone (hey)
You're gonna love me someday
Better make sure it's not too late
I told you once that i really cared
And my love i want to share
But, you don't see that it's really me, I'm what you need
And I guarantee that
You're gonna love me
(Someday)
Just like I told you
(Now it's too late)
You're gonna love me someday
Better make sure it's not to late

Take a minute, take a minute girl
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Come too far for you to feel alone

In your face I can see passion
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart

There's no way I could mistake, the girl is mine
Think it's time we got this straight, let's sit and talk face to face
There's no way I could mistake, the girl is mine

Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?

In this life
please remember
there are songs
whose endings never change.
It's a long sail home
through the storm
through many a crosshair.
All the world that hides
all the faceless people crying
seems so weak
oh but still they're trying.
But they're running blind
all the same old soldiers
dying over again
only the traces remain.
In this world
ev'ry answer
only takes
you back to the start.
It's a long sail home
through the storm
through many a crosshair.
All the world that hides
all the faceless people crying
seems so weak
oh but still they're trying.
But they're running blind
all the same old soldiers
dying over again
only the traces remain.

As the night moves in
Love takes on a new meaning
If you were here
You would know what I mean to say
The circumstance leaves me only waiting
For the chance
I only want to love you more, more
Can't you understand it
Girl you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it no
If you could only know my feelings
You would know how much I do believe
If you were here tonight
By my side
If you were with me now
When the lights go out
I can not pretend
This bed?s too big for me
To be in alone all alone
Slow burn light a candle for our love, love
So we'll always be one to one in love ooh love
Can't you understand it
Girl you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it no
If you could only know my feelings
You would know how much I do believe
If you were here tonight oh love
By my side
If you were with me now
Every night alone I just wait here anticipating
For the day I won't feel this pain baby
Please don't keep me waiting
Come to me
If you were here tonight
Ooh oh girl
Be by my side
Girl this bed's too big for me
For me to be in all alone
All alone
(By my side)
Don't keep me waiting baby
If you were with me now
Oh oh ooh hold me girl all night
Want you for myself
Do me right
Got nobody else
All by myself
Got nobody else girl
This love is true
Please take me home
Be with you tonight
Give our love a light
Do just what you feel
Please don't be a tease
Girl I love you more
You're the one that I adore

Well you're smoulderin' with fly words
Catch the moment on the run
And you say there's nothin' easy
About the plywood tract you're from
And you stand inside your wind stilts
Watch the sentence act begun
So you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?
And you stand and watch the trials go
From here to there behind the scene
Throw your troubles to the moon trolls
To swallow up like stormy dreams
Take an entrance to a stand-off
Looking if there's such a strife
And you say you lost your baby
Wondering if it's in your life
And you fly your flags on Mondays
That take a rise and fall in one
Ask the questions of the pilgrims
That come to pledge what's all that's done
Claim a tabernacle hillside
Where you'll watch the dyin' sun
And you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?
So you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?
So you say you lost your baby
Don't you know that you're the one?

Mmm mmm mmm mmmmm, keep the secret (2x)
You've got to keep the secret (2x)
Trapped in silent golden wings
Secrets in a million ways
Read the symbols on the wall
Land of gods mystery
Tales been told to you and me
Kept in chains of fantasy
Mmm mmm mmm mmmmm, keep the secret (2x)
You've got to keep the secret (2x)
For a thousand years and more
Everyone is searching for
Secrets in their history
All this happened long ago
All the stories that we know
History goes on and on
Mmm mmm mmm mmmmm, keep the secret (2x)
You've got to keep the secret (2x)
Mmm mmm mmm mmmmm, keep the secret (2x)

She gets on with life as a king,
She's an amusing kinda gal.
She likes practising guitar on Sundays,
She likes reading comics in the week.
She likes to contemplate red.
But when she starts to daydream,
Her mind turns straight to genocide.
Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom!
Does she love genocide more than red?
Does she love genocide more than red?
She likes to use words like 'bone,'
She likes to use words like 'onwards.'
She likes to use words about red.
But when she stops her talking,
Her mind turns straight to genocide.
Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom!
Does she love genocide more than red?
Does she love genocide more than red?
She likes to hang out with papyrus,
She likes to kick back with Matt,
But when left alone,
Her mind turns straight to genocide.
Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom!
Does she love genocide more than red?
Does she love genocide more than red?
She's not too fond of pacifist,
She really hates daylight,
But she just thinks back to genocide,
And she's happy once again.
Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom!

Fly high on the rug
With the ones you know
With the ones you love
With the ones you trust
Riding the van, the bus, the plane again
And hear the sounds
Little air to breathe
Little work to kill
A nice table to seat
A clean pillow to dream
New streets to ride
Another place to start
It's better to break your back
Better to break your heart
[Chorus]
I want to go wrong, if we do it
We can stop the time tonight
Bring all the bad ones
You know you got it wrong
It means we got it right
Telling lies with stars
Making up a weird glory
Young bosom, dark lies
Twisting my touring guide
Numbers I try to resist
Through your watch they disappear
All the memories you can trust
All the voices talk to much
All the photos you've seen
War medals for someone
Like me like he like she
Like me like he like she
Cause you'd better break your bed
Than lay down and sleep
[Chorus: x 2]
How many times times times times
We had the chance
How many times times times times
We had the chance
How many times times times times
We had the chance
How many times, times times
[Chorus: x 2]

The principles of lust are burned in your mind
Do what you want, do it until you find love
Feel your heart beat
Principles of lust are easy to understand
Do what you feel, feel until the end
Principles of lust are burned in your mind
Do what you want, do it until you find love
Start to move slowly, very slowly
Principles of lust are easy to understand
Do what you feel, feel until the end
The principles of lust are burned in your mind
Do what you want, do it until you find love

I'm waiting on the empty docks
Watching the ships come in
I'm waiting for the agony to stop
Oh, let the happiness in
I'm watching as the gulls all settle down
Upon the empty vessels
The faded whites of their wedding gowns
The songs of hopeless selflessness
The cold december sun
A cold that blisters
The hands of a working man
Wasted
I'm waiting on the empty docks
Watching the ships roll in
I'm longing for the agony to stop
Oh, let the happiness in
Oh, let the happiness in
Listen to the waves against the rocks
I don't know where they've been
I'm waiting for the skies to open up
And let the happiness in

I was a fool for you and
I went all round town
When I finally saw you
Now I'm speaking to make this something
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
It's not enough to hear you
Your voice will never be
I find I hate to be near you
I, I long to see this evening through
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
Ah ooh ?
Ah ooh ?
Ah ooh ?
?

Shoot,use your gun of life
I'm not afraid to die
In your arms
Shoot,use your gun of life
Keep on watching me
Poison me
Mesamedasu prince from the biomass
Ai yoku no nami ni oyogu
Kana eacute, yo holo bi na ki ai
Demo ima wa jikan ga nai
Yokubo no sensor kawasu ai no juice
Do kasen ni hi wo tomoso
Hashile hijogushi leikyaku system on
Todokazalu nanaban me no sola
Who dares to wake me?
Prince from the biomass
Swimming in the waves of your intimacy
I'm able to offer
My love for centuries
But I have no time right now
Meet my desire sensors
My atom juice of joy
You want to use my affective circuits
Run to the fire exit
Use your cooling system
You'll never reach the 7th sky today

Fade away just like our love had died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide...from you tonight
I've wrestled with angels...all my life
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind
And if I fall with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
Whoo
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Fade away just like our love had died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide...from you tonight
I've wrestled with angels...all my life
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind
And if I fall with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight
Whoo
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Whoo
And if I fall with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight

Like a fighting animal,
I'm about to take you down
Loading up a cannonball
I'mma fire at you now
I really want you, I told you twice
Into the storm I get, get ready to fight
You throw a punch, but I, I got a knife
I'm gonna catch out of my line
One two three strikes
You're out
Like a fighting animal,
I'm about to take you down
Loading up a cannonball
I'mma fire at you now
I really want you, I told you twice
Into the storm I get, get ready to fight
You throw a punch, but I, I got a knife
I'm gonna catch out of my line
One two three strikes
You're out

I want it
Oh, I want your soul
Do you want it right now?
Oh, I can't let go
I want it
Oh, I want your soul
Do you want it right now?
Oh, I can't let go
I want it
Oh, I want your soul
Do you want it right now?
Oh, I can't let go

Through the warmest cord of care
Your love was sent to me
I'm not sure what to do with it
Or where to put it
I'm so close to tears
And so close to
Simply calling you up
I'm simply suggesting
We go to the hidden place
That we go to the hidden place
We go to the hidden place
We go to a hidden place
Now I have been slightly shy
And I can smell a pinch of hope
To almost have allowed
Once fingers to stroke
The fingers I was given
To touch with but careful, careful
There lies my passion, hidden
There lies my love
I'll hide it under a blanket
Lull it to sleep
I'll keep it in a hidden place
I'll keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place
He's the beautifulest
Fragilest still strong
Dark and divine
And the littleness of his movements
Hides himself
Invents a charm
That makes him invisible
Hides in the air
Can I hide there too
Hide in the air of him
Seek solace
Sanctuary
In the hidden place
In a hidden place
In a hidden place
We'll stay in a hidden place
Oh, in a hidden place
We'll live in a hidden place
We'll be in a hidden place
In a hidden place

When the redhead girl goes by
The course of time stands still
When the redhead girl goes by
Goes by
Goes by
When the redhead girl goes by
It's a dream with a blue knife
When the redhead girl goes by
Goes by ( X4 )

Kulu came from Babalu
Eyes like rain saw into you
Kulu says throw my ashes in the sea
Kulu [Repeated several times]
With Ganesh beside me
Mataji too
Shiva, Lord Shiva
I'm begging to you
Kulu [Repeated several times]
The ocean deep as wounds upon my feet
I've stalked this earth a million times before
And I know I've paid for my crimes
'Cause life's unkind
Kulu [Repeated several times]
'Cause life's unkind

If there is a troubadour washing
It is he
If there is a man about town
It is he
If there is one to be sought
It is he
If there are nine she is
They are bought for me
This way is as is she
And he placed her
Unclothed
Long long long legged
On top of the family tree
And if he has chosen the point
While she is under him
Then leave her coily placed
Crouched sucking him
For it is I with
Her on knee
I leave her
Without pith or feel
And leave her be
Leave it be
For he controls what there'll be
He makes his face known to none
For if he is seen
Then all will
And all will know
Know me

There were these two people
Living together in a peculiar house
This house was so peculiar
Because it made such strange noises
The couple decided that they had to move
They could no longer stand living with such strange noises
So they packed their bags and
Put on their propeller hats
And so they flew
High above the ocean and forests and mountains
To find a place
Yeah they flew far into heaven to get some peace
To find a place
That would be quiet
So - quiet
But heaven was no permanent place for this silence seeking copule
Because there there were sounds too
Sky sounds
So they left the place
So they left the place
They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
That would be quiet
Absolutly quiet
They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
But everywhere they went there were these sounds
Strange sounds
Somebody else's sounds
And somebody else's sounds are lot worse to live with than one's own
So the couple found that they might as well go back home
They took off their propeller hats and
Descended between the stars
East or west - east or west
Home is best - home is best
East or west - east or west
Home is best - home is best

Down through the dark trees
You came to save me
You're so ugly and you're so beautiful
You're like no one on Earth could be
Take me home
Let me be the one
All of my life I've been waiting
For you
I wanna be the one that you take home
Let me be the one
Cause I'm so lonely
Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
Take me home
In time you'll love me like one of your own
So come on
Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
Take me home
In time you'll love me like one of your own
So come on
Take, take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
La la la la, I'm going home

I don't see them haters
But they wanna be me
I don't see them haters
But they wanna be me
I see they girl and she leaving with me
I see they girl and she leaving with me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me
Sexy girl, go ahead and put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me
Sexy sexy, put it on me

(I took a)
Cheap shot
A clean miss
Burning my defenses by the shakin' of her hips
(and then she)
Moves in
A quick kiss
Breathing down my neck, she had me wrapped around her wrist
(I tried to)
Break loose
Tight grip
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip
(It was a)
Lost Cause
A fast fight
She ain't taking any prisoners; and she's through playing nice
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah, she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down-
Until the kick-back, when my heart hits the ground
She said: "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up"
2x
Yeah
(and so I)
Let Go
I Gave In
Feeling pretty good about the trouble that I'm in
(she got me)
Beat Down
Bruised Up
I'm bleeding, barely breathing, but I can not get enough
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah, she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down-
Until the kick-back, when my heart hits the ground
She said: "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up"
2x
Yeah
She gets me deep in the chest
Straight through my bulletproof vest
She kisses like a grenade
Like a blade, a bayonet
3x
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah, she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down-
Until the kick-back, when my heart hits the ground
She said: "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up"
2x
Yeah

Jack in da house, you can do what you feel
Won't you jack in da house
Our dreams will be real
Peaople away, anytime of the day
Badadadobadui
Jack da house, c'mon c'mon

Hope is all that we have
With each birth, every tear, we have hope, we have hope
Speck of gold in your heart
Everyone, everyone
Speck of gold in your heart
Every sun, everyone
Speck of gold
Cold, cold ways, I won't
Hold you heart to this light
One and all, one and all
Speck of gold
Speck of gold, that we just unfolded
Love your heart, love your heart
Speck of gold, everyone hold our sun
Wanna live
Speck of gold
Speck of dust on our sun
Shade our world, shade our world
Speck of dust on everyone
Save our sun, save our world
Speck of dust on our sun
Shade our world, shade our world
Speck of dust on everyone
Save our sun, save our world

You're like the missing piece
Of a day's old puzzle
Try to shut me up
I won't wear your muzzle
Nobody's got my back
I keep it our visual
It's the only way, seems you wanna ridicule
Trials and tribulations
Cross the border through the nations
With your juvenile intentions
Things like our idle expectations
Could you blame us like the famous
We just wanna live like you too
Do what you did to get you through
Devious intentions but its a money making habit
Just a hand to hand transaction
So you might as well just grab it
Station to station 'cause the city never sleeps
Your rhythm driven hard, skips a beat
The weekend's like some kind of Mecca
Slow to come round those lips so wait quicker
48 hours there ain't nothin' much better to do
Than to mess up and get back together
You drink your poison for personal pleasure
Anticipation to arouse your own pleasure
But my force remains the same
Over a billion in making change
( Aurora Borealis Scatting )

Well introducing myself well I'm just too much
The MC on the mic with the magical touch
Can turn silver into gold, fat into grass
When I rock the microphone
I'm bound to pass
I got no oral levels, but massive degrees
The reason for that is plain and easy
'Cause when I went to school
They said I was the weapon
They stand up in the place with the D on my cap
Yes sir
Right about now you're shaking out the original-
Willy Wee
It goes
Don't wanna be a hit or part of your clique
About the present situation
Seems that some are in a mission
Tricky you got
You gotta drink to drive
You gotta go a lot
Don't wanna drink from your trough
To the top, but nothing less
While you'd be bidding in your staple nest
You're just bugging so why don't you give it a rest

Sometimes I like to get away from this maddening shroud
Sometimes I'll have you know, it's all insane
Maybe it's time for me to jack it in
Maybe it's time for me to track it in
Maybe it's time for me to halt
Oh, I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
After all, what is it worth?
Sometimes I like to get away from the saddening crowd
Sometimes I feel my life is all in vain
Maybe it's time for me to jack it in
Maybe it's time for me to track it in
Maybe it's time for me to halt
Oh, I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away
Throw it all away
After all, what is it worth?
Some days my strength walks out
Some days I can't go out
It is for real
We can walk about
We can work it over and over and over
I've got a good mind to throw it all away

Let the fire in your eyes
Let the fire in your eyes
Burn like hell, Russian girl
Youre a devil in disguise
Love me now, Russian girl
Here we go again x2
You make me fall inlove
Let me feel your body,
Let me touch
You make me fall inlove
Let your arms around me, let me x2
Let the fire in your eyes
Burn like hell, Russian girl
Youre a devil in disguise
Love me now, Russian girl x2
Let the fire in your eyes x3
You make me fall inlove
Let me feel your body,
Let me touch
You make me fall inlove
Let your arms around me,let me
Let the fire in your eyes
Burn like hell, Russian girl
Youre a devil in disguise
Love me now, Russian girl x2
You make me fall inlove

Could you resist money? in the name of hate?
Midijunkies gonna fuck your world! midijunkies gonna fuck you up! (x4)

Atari teenage riot! remixing the system!
They go slow and we go fast! beat them up!
Atari teenage riot means more to me
Than being number one in "everybody's charts"!
Where the hell is the philosophy of punk?
Fuck off cross over! well, could you resist?
Could you resist money? in the name of hate?
The dictionary defines heroes as having superior qualities...
And don't forget: a hero is a man who stands up! go!

Don't know where we're going*
But I know I saw in your eyes
My life growing
To unite with u
And the time is towing us to age
And tossing years
But we're still glowing
Like we never knew
We took a decision
To have no definition
And our ammunition
Is to keep our love true
We chose to share a vision
More then we envisioned
While this song is playing
I want to dance with u
So put on that record that we use to listen to
When we found the truth
A golden soft memory in blue
To repaint it, in me and in u
So put on that record that we use to listen to
When we found the truth
I'm dancing in your garden
To ease up all that's harden
plant a seed this morning
To see a flower bloom
Words need not be spoken
Sleeping souls have woken
And this song is not more then
a blooming after noon
For there is no other
For me u are the mother
A perfect sound of ever
In a perfect tune
As night slowly approaching
The sun is set for love
And when I see u smiling
I'm dancing with the moon
So put on that record that we use to listen to
When we found the truth
A golden soft memory in blue
To repaint it, in me and in u
So put on that record that we use to listen to

My life growing
To unite with u
And the time is towing us to age
And tossing years
But we're still glowing
Like we never knew

[Verse:]
We haven't spoke in six months/
You see me rolling up blunts/
You see this drank in my cup/
You think I'm caught in this mess/
Before you judge you should just wish me the best/
I know it's all for success/
The people, the liquor, the drugs, the clubs, the money, the drama,
I promise I won't self destruct/
I'll just adjust/
I know I'm not like rest/
I know myself is to blame/
Just look how far that I've came/
You know I'm with so and so who I refuse to name/
I keep them hoes entertained/
Not enough beat to explain/
You see the squad never changed/
Just a few words been exchanged/
Just a few chicks been exchanged/
Priorities rearranged/
Trap niggaz free from them chains/
You say these niggaz influenced me/
You swear them bitches have ruined me/
You still upset about you and me/
You went from boo to boo-hoo'ing me/
You see a missed opportunity/
Cut the bs like a truancy/
Now when I walk in- no who is he- bitch I'ma God/
Aye man- I don't know a man going this hard in my city- now every head nod/

Is this the future? Is this the future?
Is this the future of war? Is this the future of war?
Is this the future of war?
The future of war! The future of
war! The future of war!
Come on down to the end of the future...
We not gonna make it another day
Fighting the fight we have to fight!
You not gonna make me run away!
A white moon is shining down on me...
Where do we belong? Where do we belong?
Punk for money, piss for gold
Nothing ain't what it used to be!
I don't fear the live I wanna live
I don't fear the nothing I have to see:
The future of war! The future of war! (x3)
We never talked a revolution
We never played the cliche!
That was you having old images in your head!
We do not need to provoke
anyone...It's just a waste of time
Two minutes before action...
Check my card - It's O.K.
Check my soul and throw it away!
Crack my life and you gonna die!
I saw his eyes...
A pose like this at midnight!
It's obvious that capitalism has failed!
This is the future...
The future of war! The future of war!
The future of war! It's like a
heatwave burning through my soul!
The future of war! The future of war!
The future of war! The future of war!
War! War! War! War! War! War! War!

Through the walking, through me
I know he'd never hurt me
Daddy watched me sleeping
And pray silently
Daddy's let me sleepwalk
Without him I am secure
The only girl he'd never hurt
The one who smells so pure

Want you back in my life
I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
Oh and I
I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong
I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
Cause that's where you belong
Oh and I
I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong
Look at me
Standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
All that I won't name again
Look at me
Standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
Calling out your name again
Remember when you told me
You didn't want anybody else but me
And I'm that same girl
That's all you need to see
I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
Oh and I
I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong
Look at me
Standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
All that I won't name again

And you finally caught your breath
No, it's over now
And you're safe with me

There's a time to heal
Whisper so unreal
So believe me when I say
Close your eyes
Stop dreaming of foregone days
We can never turn back time
Regretting the words we didn't say
Take my hand

Now in our promise land

Please don't talk about love tonight
Please don't talk about sweet love
Please don't talk about being true
And all the trouble we've been through
Ah, please don't talk about all of the plans
We had for fixin' this broken romance
I want to go where the people dance
I want some action
I want to live
Action, I got so much to give
I want to give it
I want to get some too
Oh I, I love the nightlife
I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yea
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea
Please don't talk about love tonight
Your sweet talking won't make it right
Love and lies just bring me down
When you've got women all over town
You can love them all and when you're through
Maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you
I got to go where the people dance
I want some action
I want to live
Action
I got so much to give
I want to give it
I want to get some too
Oh I, I love the nightlife
I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yea
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yea
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yea
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh yea

Jesus, keep me near the cross
There's a precious fountain
Free to all, a healing stream
Flows from Calvary's mountain
In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
'Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river
Near the cross, a trembling soul
Love and mercy found me
There the bright and morning star
Sheds its beams around me
In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
'Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river
Near the cross I'll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting ever
'Till I reach the golden strand
Just beyond the river
In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
'Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river
'Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river

Underneath the moon
The tumult that forces me to action
'Cause I don't care what car they drive
My ministry's the men who need to play
Underneath the moon
The tumult that forces me to action
There's so much dross
Try me one more time
Before it's really gone forever
'Cause life was talking through you mister
I'm just listening to your system
One and one ennui makes nothing
You and you and me makes something
Life was talking through you mister
Words to hit you like a piston
One and one ennui make nothing
You and you and me makes something
Struggling with realization
I was hoping you would do it for me
Someone backed me in a corner
Grimed me with some slimy stories
Life was talking through you mister
Words to hit you like a piston
One and one ennui make nothing
You and you and me make something

Didn't know what to do with the bacon and the egg
Went to the store bought a loaf of bread
Plugged in the toaster
Popped int he bread

Maricea didn't have enough power
To make it up the eiffle towe
French Toast!!

The man in my shoes runs a life
All the papers lie tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Oh, angels fall like rain
And love is all of heaven way
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you she don't fade
The race is on, I'm on your side
But hearing you my engines die
I'm in the mood for you
Oh, for running away
All the stars come down in you
And love, love, love you can't give it away
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you she don't fade
Inside you the time moves
She don't fade away
Don't you know she don't fade
Don't you go it makes no sense
And all these talking supermen
Just take away the time, just to get it away
Oh, ain't it just like the rain
'Cause love, love, love, love, love is only heaven away
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade away
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade away
The ghost in you, she don't fade
The man in my shoes runs a life
All the papers lie tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
And love will not fade away
And love, love, love will not fade away

You see the world through your window
You don't even go outside anymore
Only feel safe feeling hollow
You think your scars are way too deep to be cured
You hide your heart in the shadows
So afraid to open up to anyone
But I can see your faded halo
And I can make it burn again, like the sun
If you stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light
But stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light shine
You don't have to be frozen
You don't have to be broken tonight
I can see your faded halo
And I can make it burn again, like the sun
Just stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light shine
You don't have to be frozen
You don't have to be broken
You don't have to be broken tonight

She can hold on to her own
If it comes to push and shove
She has kept a lookout on
Over what's left of their love
And he keeps himself held back
For both their peace of minds
But he's no less quick to know
To begrudge of what he finds
Oh, see I should soon
Oh, see I should soon
As they watch themselves grow old
As he helps her into bed
Just to hear two things about
Just a spark inside his head
Oh, I can't tell
How much all they seemed to care
And something in the way she tells me
I wish that I'd been gone
Oh, see I should soon
Oh, see I should soon

You always loved the sad songs
Like you loved it when I lost
So I don't tell you when I'm happy
'Cause it only makes you cross
And I thought as I was leaving
And it strikes me every time
Politics aside we always
Thought we always got on fine
Crystal clear were my intentions
But you didn't want to know
When there's no point in staying
You just go
Don't let it worry you
Don't let it worry you
And I'll be driving through
Provincial towns and places sweetly named
And I'll be looking for a center
For a sense of live contained
But then, I'm out the other side
And through suburban avenues
I realize it never was there
That's how I feel about you
Crystal clear were my intentions
But you didn't want to know
When there's no point in staying
You just go
When there's no point in staying
You just go
Don't let it worry you
'Cause I won't, no, I won't
Don't let it worry you
I won't, no, no, I won't
Don't let it worry you
'Cause I won't, no
Don't let it worry you
'Cause I won't, no, I won't
Don't let it worry you

A wonderful place to be
The birds are singing
The dreams that are sent to me
Everyone's waving
But there's no noises
The smell of your skin
The glittering lights of Hell
I'm missing sin
La Lovely to see you
La Lovely to see you
I want to get out of here
Inhale your sky
A beautiful place to be
So I don't know why
They're selling us something
I don't need
They're selling us something, babe
You shouldn't believe

I was running from the night sky
I was tryna find the day light
I kept running towards the moon
But then you became my flashlight
Breathe you in and I reach cloud nine
Levitating like an air balloon
You're in my system, you're in my lungs
You're my hearts rhythm, you're in my blood
A taste of you I levitate
Damn I'm such a lalala lightweight
Lalala lightweight
Damn I'm such a lalala lightweight
I was stuck in a devotion
I was moving in slow motion
I was running towards the moon
When you touch me I hear sirens
Cause for you I got low tolerance
Gets me under the influence
You're in my system, you're in my lungs
You're my hearts rhythm, you're in my blood
A taste of you I levitate
Damn I'm such a lalala lightweight
Lalala lightweight
Damn I'm such a lalala lightweight

Maya...
It's gotta be a brand new time
Ohh, Oh, Ohh
Joy got me when you see me every Saturday night.
heaven has sent you by my side
You say you'll never let me go
I was standing at your door
Crying for my little love
Te vreau pe tine...
Te vreau pe tine...
In every song, in the light, I feel love in your eyes
Te vreau pe tine...
The only star in the sky is right here by my side
Te vreau pe tine...
Don't want to control you,
Nothing inside me,
Can't break me down, break me down,
'Cause your love, it make me so silent
All reason inside me
Can't break me down, break me down,
But you say you'll never let me go
I was standing at your door
Crying for my little love
Te vreau pe tine...
Te vreau pe tine...
In every song, in the light, I feel love in your eyes
Te vreau pe tine...

I could go all night
Here in your arms
I could spend my whole life
Here in your arms
I could go all night
Give me your love and I might just keep on
Don't stop

Here in your arms
I could go all night
Here in your arms
I could spend my whole life
Here in your arms
I could go all night
Give me your love and I might just keep on dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing
Keep on dancing
Just keep on dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing
Keep on dancing
Just keep on dancing

If we were in the room again
I could shape the light this way
Temper would build me back
Legs left belonged again
There is a breath that's left
Once was a pulsing thing
You shuddered every word
You are calling time again
I will reconcile! (x4)
We are in the room again
I will flick the teeth away
Temper would build me back
Legs you left belonged again
Now you are a limping grin
Once it was a pulsing thing
Sullen as a swollen tongue
You are calling time again
I will reconcile
(Hang it in your hands)
I will reconcile
(I hope you understand)

Fifth floor,
Fourth floor,
Third floor,
Second floor,
*ding*
The rain kept falling like an endless story in the afternoon.
Wetting the trees,
Wetting the sidewalks,
Wetting the roofs of the buildings.
Deep thoughts (deep thoughts)
Light high (light high)
Wait, where am I?
I had some cheese and seedless grapes for lunch,
And floated around for the rest of the afternoon.
Asian tourists came back from Fifth Avenue shopping
With wet paper shopping bags.
Sometimes...I miss shopping,
But the thought of being a ghost made me hesitate.
I had some more cheese,
I could feed myself for another two or three hours.
If I kept my expectations low.
Deep thoughts (deep thoughts)
Light high (light high)
X2
Wait, where am I?
Deep thoughts (deep thoughts)
Light high (light high)
X2
Wait, who am I?
Oh man!
I'm so high!
So high!
You know what?
In a way, the afterlife is more civilized than the world I used to live in.
Marijuana is not illegal anymore.
No worries of guns and radiation, etc.
Whoa, what's happening here?
So many people are checking in today.
Look like a party is happening.
I wonder how many people know that life is like this:
Staying at hotel,
Renting times,
Renting a body.

How many times
Does it take to say, goodbye?
How many moves
Has the mistress, of disguise?
And if a cyclone rules my heart
Deceit is sure to loot the past
How many times
For every single day?
We're lost in the sea
Solely left to pray
And if she ever could control
I'm swimming in the green and gold
I am
It's a pagan lust
I'm your brown cocoa
Silver glistens, as the palm trees
Whisper your name
Your hand in my heart
Beat until there is no time
Just space
How many times
Does it take?
How many moves
Does she make?
And if that cyclone rules my heart

If this is a question is maybe a lie
If yes doesn't mean it does when lessen why
You are held in queue
Someone will be with you shortly
Say I'm wrong, you decide
I don't believe the words you sing sometimes
But then it's your life
Mmm

But then it's your life
Mmm

But you've only got one
You've only got one
But you've only got one
If I, just to spite you, placate your disgrace
Will song turn to silence
Will mask wear your face
Are you down to be open
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Or are you down just to be down
I don't believe the words you sing sometimes
But then it's your life
Mmm

Underneath all currents
And drop my anchor

This is my home
I live by the ocean
And during the night

Underneath all currents
And drop my anchor

That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence.
Love
Devotion

I can feel in my body
Chains on me are breakin' loose
I can feel in my body
Standin' tall I make the moves
With the sun kissing my face
There's no way that I can lose
And the thing that I crave your embrace
You're the one that's being you
I hear you say
I cant let you leave my life like this
I hear you say
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Either way that I
Cant keep feelin' the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurtin'
Either way that I

Show me the way

Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave

Date of expiration
A disease you cannot cure
It's our destination
No delays anymore
Great expectations
But the end is so near
A strange iteration
And soon it starts again
Did you ever smell the rain -
The humidity in the air?
Did you ever feel the pain -
Depending on what you will dare?
The sweetest pain you ever felt
It's fun and desperation
Emotions which you cannot steal
Love has no date of expiration
What an infiltration
Privacy's so far away
Station after station
Cannot stop my thoughts
The final decision
No excuses anymore
Time for condemnation
But do you really care?!

We climbed and we climbed,
Oh, how we climbed
My, how we climbed
Over the stars to [the] top
[of] tiger mountain
Forcing the lines through the snow.

Opportunities are lost
in a starving shade of silence
and every battle fought
has left me looking back
What we obtain through isolation
often leads us deeper into war
so tell me how can I retreat?
some things are worth fighting for
And how do we justify
when actions are conceived in weakness
is there honor in my heart
if I lack the strength to act
And though my hand is trembling
and my eyes are wreathed in so much doubt
and every instinct shows me fear
I stand my ground
We have no Olifant resounding
nor fortunes here to carry home
No epic tale becoming legend
only choices right and wrong
But somewhere in the haze of life
I find there is a perfect shining light
that each of us must seek to know
the truth of who we really are
So sing a song for Roland
and all of those who sacrificed their lives
their colors traded in for
a world of black and white
So sing a song for Roland
and all of those who fought for what was right
you may never understand
for whom they died
Perhaps they will banish me
from the annals of history
in the end it matters not
we direct our destiny
I've lived beyond myself for an instant
and heard the echoes in the hearts and faces
of the people I will never know
but I still cannot forget

Same thing, sunshine
Got change on my mind
I can't say it's alright
'Cause I need a cloudburst in my life
Thunder-showers
When love flowers
Baby, it's alright
To just get soaking wet tonight
No expectation, no demands
Just know my heart is in your hands
You got the power in control
Oh oh oh
Let it rain down love, heavenly storm
Just what I'm searching for
Let it rain down love
Can't touch the ground
Baby just let your love rain down
Make it just pour
Break it, let it storm
Shake me to my core
'Cause I need a hurricane for sure
No expectations, no demands
Just know my heart is in your hands
You got the power in control
Oh oh oh
Let it rain down love, heavenly storm
Just what I'm searching for
Let it rain down love
Can't touch the ground
Baby just let your love rain down

The glow I see, it's been following me
And it's brighter than before
It seems brighter than before
And you and me, we see perfectly
It seems lighter than before
So much brighter than before
And I could be the only
One that you'd ever need
And you could be the only
Girl that I wait for
'Cause you've got me
And we've got noise
Do you believe in love?
1, 2, 3, 4 we've got love
And motion and motion and motion
The glow I see, it's been following me
And it's brighter than before
It seems brighter than before
And you and me, we hear perfectly
It seems louder than before
So much rounder than before
And I could be the only
One that you'd ever need
And you could be the only
Girl that I wait for
'Cause you've got me
And we've got noise
Do you believe in love?
1, 2, 3, 4 we've got love
And motion and motion and motion
Did you walk across the line?
Did you shake it off your mind?
Did you ever think
That I would be the one
To bring you back?
Did you cover up the sound
Of a million golden days?
When the sun comes up
We'll all be here together, it's okay
And I could be the only
(Just think about everything)
One that you'd ever need
(Oh)
And you could be the only
(Just think about everything)
Girl that I wait for
'Cause you've got me
And we've got noise
Do you believe in love?
1, 2, 3, 4 we've got love
And motion and motion and motion

Crackin' walls inside my head
With a bottle full of rain
I promised to the coaster
I wouldn't tear it up again
Flick a peanut, break a glass
I wish I didn't sleep at Mass
And everything is closin' up
And yet again I come in last
I saw it in a dream
It was another time
And everything was blue
Everything was fine
And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine
Rise above it, rise above it, rise above it
I see her on the ceiling
She's staring down in her gown
I had to make allowances
Between my love and goin' out
Now everything is closing up
The last call is well asleep
At gigs I danced with a Blue Nun
Now heartburn is goin' cheap
I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime
And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine
I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime
And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine
Rise above, rise above it
I wouldn't tear it up again

Only for a second do they freeze
It's too easy to do it up here
Just a gentle push
And you'd be over the edge
So they let you slip in and out of sight
There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please
This place has been crossed many times
Never was there cause for worry
But there's creatures living here now
Who pray on anything that moves
There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please
Stop and strain your ears
It's scarcely more than a whisper
Still the word is out
You shoot to attention
Recognition is immediate
Answering is an instinctive reaction
There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please
'Cause no matter what was said
You know you're dead

One day is one day less to live
I want you to be my sedative
Sometimes when I drive my car
I feel trapped like a bee inside a jar...
Grains of sand is all we are
Crawling on our manic star
One tiny person in one shiny car
Spinning on our manic star...
Time doesn't stand for anyone
It doesn't matter what you've done
I want to lose myself in you
Are you afraid of dying too ?...
Grains of sand is all we are
Crawling on our manic star
One tiny person in one shiny car
Calling from our manic star...
Let's love like there is no tomorrow
Shelter each other from the pain inside...
Manic star x2 (repeat)
Grains of sand is all we are
Crawling on our manic star
One tiny person in one shiny car
Don't know how I got this scar
Crawling on our manic star
On a ride that leads so far
Hanging on our manic star
Spinning on the manic star
Coming from a manic star...

Do you remember boy when you were so cruel?
When you played the thief and I played the fool
And I, I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move
Spent so long crying over you, now I'm coming your way
Gonna make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move
Tracing faces in the sand,
Now your dagger is in my hand
I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I'm coming through
I'll make you run oh, I'll make you run, oh
I'll make you run oh, I'll make you run, oh
Coming down on you with a flashing light,
There's nowhere to run
Baby you can't hide and I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move
It's too late now the tables turned,
There's no going back and you'll never learn
Unless I make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move
And you think I'm still broken hearted,
But you will never win the war you've started
You better run, run, run
Faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I'm coming through!
And you think I'm still broken hearted,
But you will never win the war you've started,
You better open your eyes!
I'll make you run, I'll make you run, I'll make you run,
I'll make you run, I'll make you run, I'll make you run
Faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I'm coming through
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster, flashlight
Flashlight, get outta my way, get outta my way
I'm coming through
Get outta my way, get outta my way,
I'm coming through

Little bit lost and
A little bit lonely
Little bit cold here
A little bit feared
But I hold on
And I
Feel strong
And I
Know that I can
Getting used to it
Lit the fuse to it
Like to know who I am
Been talking to myself forever, yeah
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah
Still sitting on a shelf and never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day
And it feels like me
On a good day
Been talking to myself forever, yeah
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah
Still sitting on a shelf and never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me
On a good day
On a good day
On a good day
And it feels like me
On a good day

I will wade out
Till my thighs
Are steeped
In burning flowers
I will take the sun
In my mouth
And leap into
The ripe air
Alive with closed eyes
To dash
Against darkness
In the sleeping curves
Of my body
I shall enter
Fingers
Of smooth mastery
With chasteness
Of sea-girls
Will I complete
The mystery
Of my flesh
Will I
Complete
The mystery
Of my flesh
My flesh

If you are born with it
It's a gift you won't miss
It's like breathing
So if you're offered free new tricks
Accept it with open arms
'cause there ain't no four leaf clovers
Or no gypsy lucky charms
Keep knocking on the walls
And I'll blow off your...
Turn in seven hundred hours
Turn in circles again
To raise our clan
Life in the pen
My brain is mangled,sanity too
Countin' the days
I won't do any listenin'
Keep knocking on the walls
And I'll blow off your balls
Knock on the door
You're asking for more
Come in the room
Gettin' sent your doom
As the waves roll in
My five senses wearin' prim
Waves of tiny people
Trapped in a russian tin
People all over the world are screamin'
For the love of a young child will be fadin'
A taste of water and corruption
While faith and religions all over the world
Self-destruction
Many controllin' the place of a dollar
Or it's a creator on the streets flippin' collars
A bomb with a snake
In both of your fists
While a hurricane was blowin'
Breathing,just around the corner from you
A bomb with a snake
In both of your fists
While a hurricane was blowin'
Breathing,just around the corner from you
Party's empty
While I'm havin' to shave
It doesn't smell good
Beginning to fade
Stimulation I need
Some positive feed
It's time to create,don't anticipate
Put this all behind
Try to look through
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
Keep knockin' on the walls
And I'll blow off your...
A bomb with a snake
In both of your fists
While a hurricane was blowin'
Breathing just around the corner from you

Life can be so demanding
Things keep changing every way
But I know we'll still be standing
Gettin' better every day
Don't be afraid to take a chance
If you believe
The best thing about this life
It's all within our reach
We are the one, we are the one
We are the lucky people
We're taking our message to the world
We are the one, we are the one
We are the lucky people
Together our voices will be heard
Just use your imagination
It will move you very far
It's all in your hands so take it
Show the world just who you are

You say you don't waste your time
And you like to get down to the bottom line
And since you don't waste your time
Please stop wastin' mine
'Cause I know just what I want
And I'm afraid to sit and talk
About the things we used to say
To each other day to day
You're always late when it comes to love
You know everything but the things you need to know
(You need to know)
I think it's time for you to go but before you do
I think there's something you should know
If you don't use it
(Don't use it)
You'll lose it
(You'll lose it)
If you can't take it
(You can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it
I'm givin' my love to you
(My love to you)
And I want to
(Yee-hee)
And I'll take my chances
'Cause that's the way that life is
You know how funny life can be
I take a little from you, you take a little from me
I gave you love that you can't deny
Even up to here, I always try
Because I loved you, I loved you
Gave you all I had
Now you can stick it
Girl, that's too bad
A love like ours don't grow on trees
But you didn't listen and now you see
You're always late when it comes to love
You know everything but the things you need to know
I think it's time for you to go
(For you to go)
But before you do, I think there's something you should know
If you don't use it
You'll lose it
(You'll lose it)
If you can't take it
(Can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it
I'm givin' my love to you
(I'm givin' my love)
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
(Take my chances)
If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
(Can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it
I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
(And I'll take my chances)
If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
Don't waste your time to fake it
I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
Don't waste your time to fake it
I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances

I am the midnight caller
Waiting on the line
I need to be your lover
I need to get into your life
I'll be yours, for ever more
Make me yours, for ever more
When the feelings suffocate me and nobody's there
All alone I turn to you-to you-to you
I am the midnight caller
Are you ready for me now
You know, let there be no other
And your time's running out
I'll be yours, for ever more
Make me yours, for ever more
When the feelings suffocate me and nobody's there
All alone I turn to you-to you-to you-to you
I'll be at the back door waiting
For your love, anticipatin'
Every step we make together
Oh our love will be for ever
Oh our love will be for ever
I'll be yours, for ever more
Make me yours, for ever more

Can I, should I, find my way home?
Or did I, think I, better go home?
All I, said I, needed was God
But I, thought I, had it all wrong
Now can it, ever, be the same way?
When they never seem to forgive
So it hurt more that you said
On the dark side of your head
Oh, she is following me in my head, but I am all alone
Thinking I'll fall every time I wanna try to let her go
It's never easy when you think you're in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
In the wind like diamond lights, they'll blow away in desert sand
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
Why can't I fall down into the hole (Gotta get it, back back)
Why can't I fall down into the hole (Gotta get it, back back)

Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love
Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love
Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love
Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love
Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love
Able to live, able to love
Able to live, able to love
I'm available
Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love
Nobody's business
If I walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love
Able to live, able to love

Your steady breath when you're reading
I think about our love
And its lack of meaning
Complacent, yes
But I daydream about leaving
Like an oak may come and go
In an eon
The world will yawn
Yawn and move on


got a need for speed
Burning with adrenaline
in the turn i lean
let me show you what i mean
Need a change of scene
Get me on a hot machine
In starlight gleam
Blood and sweat
And Gasoline
throttle, choke
i wanna provoke (you)
sick of being polite
street light fist fight dynamite
You said give me back the night
throttle, choke
a fire stoked (you)
Better hold on tight
Let me keep you up all night
This will fill me up all right
Gotta rev it up
get me goin so i can't stop
Wanna tear it up
Open road burn engine hot


He will party each and everyday
Until the world just fades away
He surrenders almost everyday
He hopes to fade away
we were meant to cry
and we want to try
to tell you it ain't too late
Don't accept the breath of hate
(break the chains that hold you)
as a victim of the city
(break the chains that hold you)
Make a magic sweet escape
(life is not a party)
Yeah, break the chains of fate
Tell me if you are enjoying the view
From the edge where you are standing
We try to reach deep down into you're heart
But silence can be so demanding
we were meant to cry
and we want to try
to tell you it ain't too late
Don't accept the breath of hate
(break the chains that hold you)
as a victim of the city

In that morning
I want to be walking, yeah
I want to be walking on
I want to be walking on to glory
On line of the horizon I can see
City lights shining, yeah
Shining like a diamond,
Lord I believe I'm coming home
Guitar
You gotta help me now
You gotta help me now
You say you looked for the light in the words of St. Matthew
Took heed of the call to come and congregate
I got me a ticket for that gospel train
But lord I got to the station just a little too late
But into the night, I went looking for angels,
Only to find that I was walking alone
Searching the line for some sign of salvation, lord
But I found none
Mississippi Guitar
You gotta help me now
Some brother, some sister, somebody
You gotta help me now
I buried my bible at the back of the barroom
I bought me a bock
Jukebox plays Jerry Lee
I stumbled and staggered in the heat of the moonshine
A whole lotta shaking going on in me
Up in the skies, thunder is rolling,
A river is running to red down below
I'm gonna raise up my hands in some sweet supplication
It's coming, coming on strong now
So help me now

I have enough of doing my part
I want to run off - cast off - no success!
Gonna let go of all the shit! break with you all!
No success!
Too much passion to walk in the line...
Come on!
I expose your lifestyle - your concept of degredation!
No success! no success!
No success! no success!
We 'bout ta blow the fuckin' place!
Fuck lucks and leprachauns you get stepped upon
In a sec you gone transform like a decepdichan
Stayin' a step beyond light years
You're playin' upon my fears
I switch gears and bringin' fear to those within my sphere
Try to hold me down control my sound what is it you stupid
My crew split doom's like toothpick's home do you know who you fool with
Threw accoustics with cool shit fuck bullshit who you with
Arsonists set fires you getting tired you'll have - no success!
You thought we fell from your weak spell
Do tell friends and foes - we 'bout ta bring ya to hell
What's that smell? no success!
Follow if you can hollow is your plan withstand society
Government's eyin' me lyin' to me
Electric chairs fryin' me!
Damn fuckin' right! you take the truth out of my head!
Bang! and then i understand...
Radical - dressed up like a fashion style...
Wild youth - sold out! and who asks why?
Search my house and search my car!
I don't have anything to lose!
Use me! rip me off! accuse me...
The message is clear - no success!
No success! no success! (x3)
You are a soldier on the industrial battlefield...
You know i don't love for sale but you fuck to die!
I don't want to make a secret of it! your success is just a lie!
That's how we live but how are you? i don't want to work for any of you!
No more engine of your game - this time you gonna burn a blaze!
I say no! no! no! no! no success!
I say no! no! no! no! no success!
No success! no success!
Double tall latte, call me baby
Double tall latte, mobile phone

Fuck you! cause we're still on course...
His suicide, his suicide, his suicide
His suicide, his suicide, his...
No success! no success!
No success!
Come on! come on!
No success! no success!

Too fucking lazy
To have any courage
I reap the results
Take a look around and see
All I have
Ignoring all reason and any sense
I'm the exception
The rule is a lie
I clouded my head
Always taking the easy
I bought all protection
I could have been smart
It's not what I wanted
You call me shitty things
Because you're jealous of me
I don't have to try
Competition's a waste of time
It's all a waste of time
Guilt is a friend I made long ago
And together we fight any effort
Prevention or rejection
I simply give up all my chances
And you must really hate the fact
That somehow I can live with that
Join in and cop out

One in a million, two of a kind
No need to worry,
When all we got is time
You know my name, so just say it loud
Just say it loud
You own my heart only for the night
And we are young, we are restless killing time
One in a million, two of a kind!
I'm not gonna lose this feeling,
I love the way I feel inside
I'm not gonna lose this feeling,
I love the way we live
I love the way we live and die
I'm not gonna lose this feeling
I love the way we live
I love the way we live and die
I love the way we live
I love the way we live and die
I love the way we live and die!
[instrumental break]
I'm not gonna lose this feeling
I love the way we live
I love the way we live and die
I'm not gonna lose this feeling
I love the way we live
I love the way we live and die
I love the way we live
I love the way we live and die!
I love the way we live and die!

As darkness comes you sleep alone
I watch the one I've always known
Turn in the corners of your mind
Am I the focus of your smile?
Da da dum, da da dum, da da dum on a summer breeze
Somehow seeking softly into you
Da da dum, da da dum, da da dum hear the whispering
Always there, no matter what you do
I can't stop falling when my heart comes calling
Do you feel me? Warming you like rays of sunshine
Can't stop falling when my heart comes calling
Do you feel me? Warming you like rays of golden light
Summer breeze
Whispering, whispering
Summer breeze
Whispering
These shadows hide your deepest fears
If only you knew I was here
You're safe and sound beneath my gaze
You have no need to be afraid, I love you
I can't stop falling when my heart comes calling
Do you feel me? Warming you like rays of sunshine
Can't stop falling when my heart comes calling
Do you feel me? Warming you like rays of golden light
Da da dum, da da dum, da da dum on a summer breeze
Somehow seeking softly into you
Da da dum, da da dum, da da dum hear the whispering
Always there, no matter what you do

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me
I'm lonely, please listen to what I say
I can't go on livin' life this way
I've tried and I've tried, oh to make you see
You call this love, all this lyin', my friend, it just can't be
[Chorus]
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me
I'm lonely, please hold me, come closer, my dear
It feels so good just havin' you near
But who am I foolin' when I know it's not real
I can't hide all this hurt and pain inside I feel

Oh yeah
Stop this crazy thing!
See what they're doin'
People are starvin'
Children are cryin'
Animals are dyin'
Governments who lie to you
Don't let them tell you what to do

I'm an everyday girl
Who's looking out for me
In a throw, throw away world
Where the blind can see
Yeah I'm thinking about my situation
And everything I've ever seen
It's not about the world that fails me
You know, it's basic humanity
No wonder why, I sure don't count on nothing
Believe the hype, I'm saying something
A sensation sound vibing off as it replays
High on higher ground and I'll be here always
I'm an everyday girl
Living in a throw away world
I'm an everyday girl
Take the pressure, take the pressure off me yeah
Everybody has two faces
Which one's looking at me, yeah
I wonder why I sure don't count on nothing
Believe the hype, I'm saying something
A sensation sound vibing off as it replays
High on higher ground and I'll be here always
I'm an everyday girl
Living in a throw away world
I wonder why I sure don't count on nothing
Believe the hype, I'm saying something

Just imagine a world where hearts don't break
And goodbye was a word no one would say
Where people were people, not cogs in machines
And a child had no worries, just cartoons and dreams
Just imagine a night with me back in your arms
Where the light of tomorrow outshines the dark
Where no one walks out, they only walk in
Until then, I'll just imagine
Just imagine a clock whose hands would reverse
And pride had no voice 'til love spoke first
Where you pull in the drive when the work day is through
And I'm waiting there like I used to do
Just imagine a home where we live and we laugh
And look to the future, not old photographs
It's my wish on a star, my prayer in the wind
Until then, I'll just imagine

No one noticed you had disappeared
Its been two days no connection
Pile of hardware making hits
If the quality is high
At the party there's a place for you
On the guest list there's a place for you
In a somebody's arms
In the real world, its at your front door
Wanting everything and moving places
Worn to make the mind crash
Snapping into Making sense
Being off schedule with the world
In the cosmopolitan we see Jeff Koons
Celebrating yummy things, celebrating,
And talking of his...of his suffering
Break through program for senior executives guide to slow dance Tokyo
Unhealthy rise and danger, INB BSE chief impact
officers, who's helping? fear of regional digital divide,
its mount fuji sitting above the clouds
searching for consensus
master bites the bullet
how clearly do you need?
your customers company economy going public
we have both
[Chorus]
It won't work
It doesn't make sense
It can't be done
Do it this way
No that way, stop!
It can't be done
Do it this way!
Do it this way!
It won't work
It doesn't make sense
It can't be done
Do it this way
No that way, stop
Imagine a different way
Do it this way
Tickets unused, toys of the mind
We think improvement, a better feeling
Generated, accelerating
That was a strange movie you took me through
He's a finder of strange things
Random, cardboard box
In the closet, left untouched
For a future functions
When the animal comes out
Voice of terror
Screaming at you
Screaming at you
What you think is real
Nation in the grip of phone fever
Three, the big three
Shooting from the hip
This is no way to pick a president
Shooting from the hip
Cover feature, divided world
Shooting from the hip
Star bright, survival of the fittest
Shooting from the hip
Open market economy, Microsoft 8
Shooting from the hip
Deal in human rights, lost connection
[Chorus]

Lay My Love
I am the crow of desperation
I need no fact or validation
I span relentless variation
I scramble in the dust of a failing nation
I was concealed
Now I am stirring
And I have waited for this time.
I am the termite of temptation
I multiply and find my population
I am the wheel I am the turning
And I will lay my love around you.
I am the sea of permutation
I live beyond interpretation
I scramble all the names and the combinations
I penetrate the walls of explanation
I am the will
I am the burning
And I will lay my love around you.
I am the will
I am the yearning
And I will lay my love around you.

What the fuck?
They know what is what,
But they don't know what is what,
They just strut.
What the fuck?
They just know,
What they know,
What they don't know,
What is what.

I shall not cease from mental fight
No politics will see me right
No man in space; no space in man
A God shaped hole in a God shaped land
Astral america
La la la l-america
Use up your body; sister sublimate
Burnt up my brain to an empire state
Libera me me me domine
Blow me away like j.f.k.
Astral america
La la la l-america

Pleasure is my thing, I want to tell you.
I'll do what you want me to, or I'll do nothing at all!
(chorus 1)
I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
A get me hot and see what you want me to be.
(chorus 2)
If you want me to, I'll do it.
If you want to dance lets get to it.
Let's not take too long let's move it.
Cause if you take too long, you lose it.
(chorus 3)
Who said that funk was done just by one.
Who said that it was never ever done?
Who said the two of us couldn't groove.
It wasn't me but maybe it was you.
(chorus 4)
Music is here for everyone.
Just to dance just to have some fun.
Just because, we did it before.
Doesn't mean we can't have some more.
(chorus 5)
I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
I'll be your freaky deak if you want me to be.
Play my music loud I'll do my dance for you.
Cause when the music's pumping its hard to tell what we're gonna do.
If you think you can we'll dance to death all night.
Cause the pleasure I can give will make things turn out right.
If you want me to, I'll do it.
If you want to dance lets get to it.
Let's not take too long let's move it.
Cause if you take too long, you lose it.
(chorus 3)
Who said that funk was done just by one.
Who said that it was never ever done?
Who said the two of us couldn't groove.
It wasn't me but maybe it was you.

Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
I'll be your freaky deak if you want me to be.
Music will make things turn out right
And I will dance till the broad day light
Feel my body fulfill your needs
Cause I know you're hungry
And I'm here to please
Alright, alright, alright, alright!
I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
I'll be your freaky deak if you want me to be.
Who said that funk was done just by one.
Who said that it was never ever done?
Who said the two of us couldn't groove.
It wasn't me but maybe it was you.

Just because, we did it before.
Doesn't mean we can't have some more.
(Chorus 3)
Who said? We said? Who said

On my marks
Get set I'm ready go
It's time we part
Been mis-communicating in my heart
I broke a sweat at a foolish pace
'Cause you got me three, two, one
Faster than a shooting gun
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
'Cause you ain't no race worth the winning
So leave my town
Don't need Lady trying to bring me down
Destroying everything without a sound yeah
The back of you is the sweetest thing
Now you got me three, two, one
Faster than a shooting gun
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
'Cause you ain't no race worth the winning
No no no
Gold or silver ain't gonna miss you
Gold or silver ain't gonna miss you
Gold or silver ain't gonna miss you girl
'Cause you ain't worth the winning no
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
Gonna run, run, run as fast as I can
'Cause you 'aint no race worth the winning
Me what you know about me
Everything you don't see
Gonna run as fast as fast as as fast as I can
Running shoes on
Running shoes on
Running shoes on
See you later
Fast as I fast as I fast as i can

Lied to my face
I'm losing track of every tongue that I taste
It's like the whole world is upside down
Can't even tell if this is real right now
Heads in the sky
We're gonna fly around with flames in our eyes
Just gonna laugh about it all night long
Somebody's gonna have to carry me home
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don't remember, don't remember, don't remember, oh
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don't remember, don't remember, don't remember, oh
Lung's coming up
Can't even think about it
Dreams in a cup
Just wanna dance about it, lose our minds
Just wanna dance about it, lose our minds
Lied to my face
I'm losing track of every tongue that I taste
Just wanna laugh about it all night long
Somebody's gonna have to carry me home
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don't remember, don't remember, don't remember, oh
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don't remember, don't remember, don't remember, oh

Dig
The chills that you spill up my back
Keep me filled with satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
Your groove, I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge, my supper dish
My succotash wish
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
Groove is in the heart, Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart, Groove is in the heart
Watch out!
The depth of hula groove
Move us to the nth hoop
We're going through to, Horten hears a who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I been told he can't be sold
Not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another
Someone's in this torso (yeah)
Hot! Gotta deal you wanna know (wanna know)
Dee-Liteful truly Dee-Liteful (liteful)
Makin' it doin' it 'specially at show (show)

Breathing in your sip of gold
I follow all your little lines
I like to watch a thousand times
I want to feel you here
I like to watch a thousand times
I make a shrine for you
Time out from the world
Leaving it all
Just for a day
You like there's a dawn
Hold me and round
Take us a day?
Here I go I'm going back
On every word you ever said
I'm dreaming of another time
Yesterday my alibi
We changed the world just you and I
I make a shrine for you

Baby, I need you here with me
Because I've tried to make you understand
I want you, each move you make
I realize you are the right one for me
Move it up, come baby, move it up
Come baby move it up
Come baby move this rhythm
Move it up, come baby, move it up

Take the chance, now step this way
Make the move, now seize the day
For what you had is what you miss
Hand in hand, you know you wish
That's the way I feel
The way I'm gonna be
That's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
The way I'm gonna be
That's the way I feel
Move it on up, move it on up, move it up
Move it on up, move it on up, move it up
Move it to the rhythm - move it up
Move it to the rhythm

Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And don't you know that life is just a game
That you play, win or lose, it's all the same
Open your eyes, you better
Look before you leap, take heed
And watch the signs of life
Don't play the cheat
The wheel of fortune just may take its toll
Be a gambler, play your ace in the hole
You'll never know
You might wind up way ahead
Shoot your best shot
Take a little chance before you're dead
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Here you come with that smile upon your face
I assume that even time cannot erase
Confidence is the most important thing you need
To look inside yourself, you can succeed
All the time you better watch out for the trap
Be careful or first time out
You might roll crap
One mistake and life comes tumblin' down
All around, like galloping dominoes
That's how it goes
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

I'm not hard as a rock, I'm just not easy to break
But don't take it as an open invitation to try
Cause I'm just hopin' this time that it's all in my mind
I won't find that there's anything to worry 'bout
I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun
And you can call me a fool, but I just wanna see my baby smile
I don't wanna kill the mood, I don't care if I'm in denial
It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time
You think I'm cold as ice, I'm just not easy to burn
But don't turn me into someone who'll break down and cry
Let's get this thing on the line, keep it simple somehow
There's no need, for fixing what's not broken now
I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun
And you can call me a fool, but I just wanna see my baby smile
I don't wanna kill the mood, I don't care if I'm in denial
It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time
I know jealousy is wrong, but the feeling's too strong
And it takes me too long to believe it's not real
So if it's innocent, don't push me into it
Cause I can't handle it, if you're only teasing
It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time

Stay tonight
We'll watch the full moon rising
Hold on tight
The sky is breaking
I don't ever want to be alone
With all my darkest dreaming
Hold me close
The sky is breaking
I don't ever want to be alone
With all my darkest dreaming
Hold me close
The sky is breaking

No longer gold made from dirt

I had a love, when you came along,
But now you're gone, now you're gone.
Picnics in the park, we did it all.
I loved you my dear. Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
The rise and fall.
The rise or fall.
But who says I needed someone to break my heart.
Who says you needed to come along and tear it all apart.
Cause I don't Know-oowoh-oowohoowoh, but you do it so well.
I know it's crazy-ee but I love you still.
I love you still.
I love you still.
Oh, I love you still.
I love you still.
I love you still.
I love you still.
Oh, I love you still.
I love you still.
Oh, we watched the sunset, we even watched it rise.
Oh it hurts my heart, hurts my heart to think about those times.
I wore my heart on my sleve-eve, no.
And I never would have though, I never would have thought, that you'd leave.
That you would leave
Oh, that you'd leave-eve, whoah-oh-oh.
That you'd leave.
But who says I needed someone to break my heart.
Who says you needed to come along and tear it all apart.
Cause I don't Know-oowoh-oowohoowoh, but you do it so well.
I know it's crazy-ee but I love you still.

I thought we had it all, I knew we'd rise and fall.
But I gave you my heart, I gave you my whole.
I thought we had it all, I did what I could.
And you kissed me like somebody who loves me should.
I thought we had it all, I knew we'd rise and fall.
But I gave you my heart, I gave you my whole.
I thought we had it all, I did what I could.
And you kissed me like somebody who loves me should.
But who says I needed someone to break my heart.
Who says you needed to come along and tear it all apart.
Cause I don't Know-oowoh-oowohoowoh, but you do it so well.
I know it's crazy-ee but I love you still.
I love you still.
I love you still.
Oh, I love you still.
I love you still.

I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
'Cause I wait and I know that I'll run
Better not play if you think you've been burned
I'll move cause I like it
I won't be denied if it don't fit
'Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
'Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
So you got some premonition all about my ways
Think you know some, but you're no one
You're getting in my way
Always looking over my shoulder
But you'll never see what I'm about 'til it's over
I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
'Cause I wait and I know that I'll run
Better not play if you think you've been burned
I'll move cause I like it
I won't be denied if it don't fit
'Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
'Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
I wanna be a diver into the sea
Beyond my world, going over me
A dangerous world, setting me free
I wanna be a climber in liquidity
The hardest world hanging over me
The fear of the cold, setting me free
Set me free
I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
'Cause I wait and I know that I'll run
Better not play if you think you've been burned
I'll move cause I like it
I won't be denied if it don't fit
'Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
'Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch
'Cause I feel, and I touch

I know so many
Places in the world
I follow the sun
In my silver plane

Sun is coming up over the hill
I can hardly sit still
I got the will and I'll find a way
I am not afraid
Waited for the chance
All of my life
I can't watch it go by
Now is the time
It's our choice to make
Every breath we take
No more praying
Off your knees
Play your heart out
Till your finger's bleed
Yesterday's history
Tomorrow's a mystery
But today we're gonna shine
So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly
So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly
Reaching for a higher elevation
A new destination
New revelation
Find it in your heart
That's where you start, yeah
So, no more praying
Off your knees
Play your heart out
Till your finger's bleed
Yesterday's history
Tomorrow's a mystery
But today we're gonna shine
So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly
So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly
Nothing to fear
But fear itself
You got nothing to lose
So give it hell
I'm not wasting more dimes
On wishing wells
We gotta rise up high
So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly
So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly

You come home late and you come home early
You come on big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home fucked up
Sometimes you don't come home at all
Chorus:
So what in the world's come over you
And what in heaven's name have you done
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run
Well I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind
Repeat Chorus:
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow
We ain't got one word to say
Repeat Chorus:
Ending:
You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run

It flies
The you-fly gets in your ear
The you-fly gets to your brain
The you-fly sticks on your nerves
Grips on your blood pressure
Drives you to more pleasure
You-fly magic touch on your head
Down to your tips
Now start to move and dance
Now start to groove in trance
Stand up, you electronic insect
Stand up, you electronic force
No sign of mortal bite
Just keep on flying, all right!
Now, you're an electronic insect
Now use your electronic force
Blood pressure
More pleasure
It flies

Fresh out of the asylum
Highest guy on the island
Least widest eyes, visors hide 'em,
I was we known that we ridin, back in the 90s
But now it ain't likely
Now I live life for Fridays, I stole that life, I rile it
You'll find me wherever that party vibe is
Because what can I say I like it?
They say that I'm outta control
That I'm totally lost
This possibly gonna be costing colossally
Know I'm the boss, and we roll with no posse
I'm totally confident,
Know we're the best on the continent.
I heard you spit, you're incompetent
And work on your confidence, clarity, presence,
Time's of the essence, don't need your blessings
I told you I'd teach you a lesson
So hello, fellows
Welcome to the gallows
It's time to teach you a lesson
[x 3]
So hello, fellows
Welcome to the gallows
I oughtta teach you a lesson
I will never ever know, of a low
Money doesn't have a low
I will never ever know
That's why no standard guy could ever afford
or fantasize about being this good
I speak as a good man under a hood
Don't treat me a hood man, under the good
'cause my lung full of blood
I aint' no daft mug sat in the pub
I get stuff done, check all of the above
I could teach you a lesson or two about
Blessin' a tune, about destitution
'cause that's the best use for music,
my mouth gets used how I choose to use it.
I feel a build of aggression, I'm guessing
we'll watch the club go west in the next few seconds
You're either reppin'
or you're a weapon
I told you I'd teach you a lesson.
So shallow, so shallow...
I oughtta teach you a lesson
[x 4]

We see the soul and the pain
We tried our best to save the world
But everyday is still the same
All the violence all the blood and every tear
Fill your minds more and more with hate and fear
We fight against everything and everyone
With every war we tried to make our kingdom come
Everyday we lose ourselves more and more
But still we pray for someone to save our souls
We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide
We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide
We see the soul and the pain
We tried our best to save the world
But everyday is still the same
All the violence all the blood and every tear
Fill your minds more and more with hate and fear
We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide
We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide
We fight against everything and everyone
With every war we tried to make our kingdom come
Everyday we lose ourselves more and more
But still we pray for someone to save our souls
We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide
We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide

Oh, she was young in her mind
They're the days, they were old and tired
Along came a love
She had yearned for so long, oh, she felt on fire
She'd do anything for him
She'd do anything for him
Oh, he was close as the label in a shirt
Never left her side
Oh, he would lace handkerchief in the rain
If she ever walked by
He'd do anything for her
He'd do anything for her
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Stuck in a world that would pull them apart
And it cost in time
If only they knew up ahead loomed a cloud
That was as black as night
She'd do anything for him
She'd do anything for him
Oh, they were strong
They could take on the world and put up a fight
And even the clouds couldn't stand in the way
When they held on tight
He'd do anything for her
He'd do anything for her
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Don't hold your breath too long
For white diamonds in the snow
Don't hold your breath too long
For white diamonds in the snow
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now

I hear your voice
Way down inside.
A whispering sea
Of towering trees;
But no reply.
A silence so rare,
And more than I can stand.
Sweeps like a flood,
Through life's flesh and blood,
And steals away with it's heart.
If I'm losing you,
Then there's nothing more that I can say.
The fighting is on,
And battles are won,
Or thrown away.
But if I could live,
Safe and sound,
In God given fields,
Or mountains of steel;
Then here I'd stay.
Till you'd gone.
Guilty of stealing
Every thought I own.
I will take my turn
To fight the bullfight.
Every word's sunk in deep,
Like the blades of a knife through my heart,
But my strength will return
To fight the bullfight.
As time's come to show,
I'm told nothing more than I should know.
A ship on the sea that threatens to leave,
But never goes.
This island of blue,
Where life clings to your hands
Like water and sand,
Will lose it's way
When you're gone.
When all's forgiven,
Still every fault's my own,
I will take my turn
To fight the bullfight.
Say a prayer for my release,
When every hope in the world is asleep,
And my strength will return
To fight the bullfight.

This is how we do it
This is how we do it
On Friday night, and I feel all right.
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the floor cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, Monty, yea you made it!
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you gonna get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
(This is how we do it)
Eastern London does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors who got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And we wave 'em from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
Now I'm a big G; boys say I've got the money
Hundred-dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a 64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
(This is how we do it)
All London does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors who got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it

Hard work, low pay, tired aching back
Earning by the sweat on my brow
12 full hours in this manmade hole
Doin what they taught me how
Chorus
Im a spike drivin railway son-of-a-gun
Working on the southern line
14 miles through this mountain side
Working with sweet Carrie on my mind
The boss mans mean hes full of hate
Livin on the workers sweat
The steaks he eats keeps him good and fat
Soup beans is all we get
Chorus
From daylight to dark we work in the tunnel
Scared of a bad cave-in
Aint got enough eat to or money to buy with
No insurance for our kin
Chorus 2x

Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Pick it all up now,
Put it back in your mouth.
Pick it all up now.
Pick it all up now,
Put it back in your mouth.
Pick it all up now.
And swallow...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
You took away my red lips,
And then cut them up in pieces.
So now I can't kiss the moon,
So now I can't kiss the moon goodnight.
No longer fly,
Through the clouds.
No longer touch the starsâ?¦
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
I'm lying still,
Waiting.
Completely dried out,
Longing.
Longing,
For the rain
To whip the roof
And make me,
Defencelessâ?¦
You took my lips away,
You took my red lips.
You took my lips away,
You took my soft, red lipsâ?¦
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Picking up pieces, talking loudly...
Pick it all up now,
Put it back in your mouth.
Pick it all up now.
Pick it all up now,
Put it back in your mouth.
Pick it all up now.
And swallow...

I will reach out
To switch you on
I will reach out
Till you come
I will reach out
To turn you on
I will reach out
Until you come
We're the masters
Of the superblaster
Don't start playing games
You can't finish
Don't open doors
When you don't know what's waiting
Don't try to close your hands
They're smaller than the rain
Have you got anything left to say
Before I shoot myself
I will reach out
To find the truth
I will reach out
To steal your youth
We're the masters
Of the superblaster
Don't start playing games
You can't finish
Don't open doors
When you don't know what's waiting
Don't try to close your hands
They're smaller than the rain
Have you got anything left to say
Oh no
Oh no
I will reach out
To switch you on
I will reach out
To steal your youth
An that's the god's honest truth
We're the masters
Of the superblaster

"You know the truth."
"Where are you?"
"You could call it the end of the world.."
You fucking parasite
Feeding off my voice like a leech
Sucking me dry
Use your head
Hope you're gagging in your throat
Hope you gag and choke
Your pale little face turning blue
If you want it in your ass as I spit in your face
Face down on the floor holding you by your neck
Do you feel like a wreck?
Well that's life, kiddo
Now shut up and swallow
Shut up and swallow
You'll get nothing for free
Don't try to suck it off me
You always take you what you want
Now I just take what is mine
I'll give you abstinence
You tell of life..
It's up to you to fill it with substance
I'll play your game
A lesson of life: It's not what you want, but what you get
You'll feel it from within as I work my way out
Such a pretty girl, but such a dirty mouth
Now you want it in your ass as I spit in your face
Face down on the floor, holding you by your neck
Do you feel like a wreck?
Well that is life, kiddo
Now shut up and swallow
Shut up and swallow
"Where are you?"
"You could call it the end of the world."

When I listen to my stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo, in stereo, in stereo

Boombox blasting like a siren
Roar you're a mighty lion
Roar when pumping the iron
Roar one million strong

Got you yearning, turning reckless
You don't understand but you still want to check this
One to two to two to one techniques
Busting the funk, freaking the funk
Eating the funk, making it funk
Loving the funk, falling to funk
Yeah, so what's up punk
But how right, but how right, but how right

The devil don't change, devil changes you
I carve your name straight across my wrist
Your voice bleeds through yelling out my name
Left with a choice, stand tall or fall down
The laughter in your eyes, now it's all the same
I would offer you my life just to see through your eyes
Just to see the world as it's meant to be seen
What became of me, it never hurt like this
At the end of it all a heartless machine
At the end of it all
At the end of it all
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
Everything I need, in front of me
What I want it to be, it cannot be
I never let it out in secrecy
Within this world, inside of me
Everything I need, in front of me
What I want it to be, it cannot be
I never let it out in secrecy
Within this world, inside of me
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
At the end of it all
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
Now I stand alone
At the end of it all

Open your eyes and see my face
Slow down for me in this dirty rat race
You could be fat, you could be thin
Wake up with me in the Raddison
It's two for one or one for free
Get it now 'cause it's a freebie
One, two, three, four
I'm the one that you adore
99 cents
I'm not crazy about money, but
I like what it can do
Shopping is a cultural activity
In this worlds nothings for free
Buy a book or buy a car
Look what a stud you are
Its not the what, its more the where,
Who you know and how
99 cents
Luxury, the income tax of vanity
Supermarket shoppers all over the world
It's not as cheap as it may look
Rob you blind 'cause I'm a crook
Read all about it in John Pilgers book
Rattrap, I see a rat trap
But the cheese I want the sleaze, sleaze sleaze so
Jimmy up the street singing something great to the beat
Goody goody boy, got you back in town
Gotta go gotta go
Gotta go gotta go
Where is what with who and how
You want it fast you want it now
Give it to me right now high and low
Fun and free got loads of dough
Life is fast life is cheap
Got nothing to do but hang in the street
Where is what with who and how
You want it fast you want it now

I don't see why you won't groove, won't have this dance with me.
Rigor Mortis won't sit, just sit there and you'll see,
The music sounds to good for you to look and act this way.
Just free your mind of all your thoughts and you will surely say yeah!
Are you ready? For the party maker!
Are you ready? For the jazz taker.
Say uh, uh, uh- get on down.
Say it feels good then sure man get on down.
Say you-can't do it like you should.
Then move aside, 'cause ? ain't how to do.
Now get on down! (conversation)
IF you hustle- that's cool.
If you bustop, you know thats cool too.
Say you can't do what you wanna do.
The musics good, I wanna get down wichu.
Say I've got to shake it out the scene.
What's good for you, might not be good for me.
Now get on down!
You shake your hips, you got on down, there's not much more to say.
And now this thing is over, I'd like to go your way.
You say that's not too slick, 'cause ya man couldn't dig it quite that way.
Well, Hey! That's cool, go on home, we'll party anyway.
Now get on down!

I can feel you now
Turned around and you were coming down
And I can feel the weight of this all falling
And I can feel the weight of this all falling
Down
I can see you now
Looked around but you were deeper down
And I can feel the weight of this all falling
And I can feel the weight of this all falling
Down
I can see you now
and all my weight is falling
I believe you now

The song is an instumental track
F.Y.I

Love on our side, love on our side
That's what makes you feel
Love on our side, love is on my mind
And I can find your heart is beating next to mine
Love on our side, love is on my mind
And I can find your heart is beating next to mine
Love on our side
That's what makes you feel
Love on our side
That's what makes you feel
Love on our side, love is on my mind
And I can find your heart is beating next to mine
Love on our side, love on our side
Your heart is beating next to mine
That's what makes you feel
Mmm, love on our side
Love on our side, love on our side
My heart is beating for you

The highlands and the lowlands
Are the roots my father knows
The holidays at Oban
And the towns around Montrose
But even as he sleeps
They're loading bombs into the hills
And the waters in the lochs
Can run deep but never still
I've thought of having children
But I've gone and changed my mind
It's hard enough to watch the news
Let alone explain it to a child
To cast your eye 'cross nature
Over fields of rape and corn
And tell him without flinching
Not to fear where he's been born
Then someone sat me down last night
And I heard Caruso sing
He's almost as good as Presley
And if I only do one thing
I'll sing songs to my father
I'll sing songs to my child
It's time to hold your loved ones
While the chains are loosed and the world
Runs wild
And even as we speak
They're loading bombs onto a white train
How can we afford to ever sleep
So sound again

Ok, let's go to work
Who the fuck are you?!
The workaholic
The workaholic
The workaholic he works every day, 24 hours, no time to play
He won't quit; he's addicted to work
I think he's going out like a jerk
Working, Working, what can you do?
See the light from a different point of view
Ready in the morning for the bell to chime
I think he's glad it's working time
The workaholic
Work your body, baby work your soul
Keep on workin' workin' to the bone
Work your body, baby, work your soul
I'm a workaholic when I'm on the floor
The workaholic!
First like a jerk, why you always work?
Messing up your mind with that paperwork?
The only think you need is to break ball
Is work, and yo and shat's all.
They do it for money, but he for fun
He won't get away until the job is done
Drinkin' drinkin' like an alchoholic
The guy is just a workaholic
The workaholic!
The workaholic!
The workaholic!

Don't you cry, baby blue
Didn't want to be a dream
Just a kiss in the dark
It will break your heart in two
Just a girl, just the night
Come on, babe, that's all right
And so my sweet, don't you cry
Don't you argue, don't you fight
What's so bad? What's so mean?
Didn't want to spoil your dream
Baby, don't you run away
Never change the way we did
What's a kiss? What's a night?
Well, I'm sorry if it's right
You and me, that's okay
Let's go fighting for the light
The final heartbreak killed my dream
Feeling the pain that made me scream
You loved me, so it seemed
But your love was too extreme
The final heartbreak made me cry
Bridges are burning in the night
You made my feelings die
By that achin' pain inside
So, goodbye
Baby, please, take my hand
Just forgive me if you can
It's so human as you know
And what's more, I'm just a man
I won't see her again
I don't even know her name
Don't you say it's a shame
Loving you is not the same
What's so bad? What's so mean?
Didn't want to spoil your dream
Baby, don't you run away
Never change the way we did
What's a kiss? What's a night?
Well, I'm sorry if it's right
You and me, that's okay
Let's go fighting for the light
The final heartbreak killed my dream
Feeling the pain that made me scream
You love me, so it seemed
But your love was too extreme
The final heartbreak made me cry
Bridges are burning in the night
You made my feelings die
By that achin' pain inside
So, goodbye
Don't you cry, baby blue
Didn't want to be a dream
Just a kiss in the dark
It will break your heart in two
Just a girl, just the night
Come on, babe, that's all right
And so my sweet, don't you cry
Don't you argue, don't you fight
What's so bad? What's so mean?
Didn't want to spoil your dream
Baby, don't you run away
Never change the way we did
What's a kiss? What's a night?
Well, I'm sorry if it's right

From standing to crouching
Silently falling
Falling from nowhere to nowhere
Nothing between

This is the last trick I'll do

Remain for some time
Down here below
Allowing the doubt to feed upon me
And even the ones
Who've never been
Are climbing the wail up ahead
I get up start crawling
Into the same
Over and over and over again
Smelling the plastic
Smelling the spit
And smelling my own breath
This is the last trick I'll do

It's battleship grey outside
And we don't know what we'll be getting
All your sweet talking, raining over me
'Til my name escapes, and I'm set free
There's a word in your eye,
But I don't know what is to say it
And when you call me from the other side,
A sense of it starts breaking up, and its lies
I don't know, what I'm getting,
But I'm getting something,
I don't know, what I'm getting,
But I'm getting something
It's battleship grey outside,
Confusion, all this is for the gods
Uncertainty, I could be bathing under artificial light
Under twilight blue, starts to mesmorize
And I tell myself that you light up my life
But its all in the mind when you cannot see in the eyes
'Cause I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something,
I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something
It's battleship grey
All your sweet talking, raining over me
'Til my name escapes, and I'm set free

Stop bein' a bad joke
It's not the same
Feeling that sunshine
And forgetting the rain
It feels so peaceful
Without the rain
Your life's got happy
You got on the TV
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Being with each other
We're havin' fun
I've got time to spare so
I might find the one
We dig each other
And break the rules
We love one another
And that's no fool
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
I take a piece of paper
And write your name
You put it in your pocket
And I did the same
We love each other
And that's for sure
I live here without you
I can't take it no more
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)

Slean Sarah
Blue Parade
Twin Moon
hey Mister Paper
better get your story straight
we're not from the sixties
and it's Sarah with an H
and oh sometimes
the way you read things
the way you see things
hurts my heart
I fear
somehow they'll find the need
To spit out my name
like a watermelon seed
sometimes
I think what am I doing?
this business of bleeding
a dime for showing
my heart
oh twin moon
you are my twin moon
take me up-sky so I can kiss you
drink your starlight
I want to show you
I want to show you
my heart

Your window closes
I am crucified
there shall be no more mockery
of the gifts of the gods
no more comparisons
no more distortions
my heart is heavy as stone
I am Prometheus
all courses I am aware of from here
oh you, frail of heart
I am not without pity
take heed,
one final nail
unnamed / undriven
This Nail Shall Represent Hope

He gambles on the saddle
He's pulling on the mane
He thrashes on the horse's back
Ambition is a bloody game
Horse doesn't want to jump
The river looks too wide
Well he faces every hurdle
With a nervous state of mind
Stay with me, breathe deeply
Take three passes back
Turn and make a full attack
The gods are laughing
And they're tugging at the reins
But he's taken to his wings
And they hit the bank
Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off
His finger's on the trigger
His eye is on the clock
He doesn't give the game away
And quickly fires the bullets off
Six hearts cut short
Still dreaming they're alive
Blown 'round in dusty circles
Like an absent state of mind
Who hunter? who victim?
God love America
He surely doesn't love him
Hitching out of nowhere
Lines of traffic knee deep
A chance to stave the morning off
And get some sleep
Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off
He wears a crucifix
His mother left to him
It's wrapped in chains around his heart
Rusted and wafer thin
Don't count on luck son
All the angels sing
Don't need to check a weathervane
We all know what tomorrow brings
Life is a cattle farm
Coyotes with the mules
Life is a bullring
For taking risks and flouting rules
Who needs a safety net
The world is open wide
Just look out for card sharks
And the danger signs
Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off

If I say I'll always stay by your side
Stupid things say some night
Can you tell me I am wrong till I cry
Tell me do you have the right
If I say that seas could never sweep me
Overboard and far away
Do you still say you wouldn't try to keep me
If I lost the will to stay
You won't promise this will last much longer
Than the time it takes to stay
You excuse is that my heart's much stronger
And some of you love has been drained away
I can't bear it when the tears fill your eyes
And I've said too much once more
Don't be angry now you must realize
My only fear's of losing something I adore

In my mind you're by my side
See you - wherever you are
I feel you're touching my skin
The time stands still just for us
Without you there's no hope in my darkness
You give me the moment
Which is never ending
Let me feel your heart
And I'll go with you to the end of this world
My angel of the night
I'm forever by your side fly with me to eternity
hold me in your arms and kiss me
I close my eyes and dream with you
Carry me so far away
Never let me down and kiss me
Angel of the night
Unite in one soul
You lead me on the way, the way of our shadows
Show me your burning desire
I follow you
I follow you into the garden of pleasures

I'm lying as far out
Towards the edge
As possible
So far out
That I'm almost tripping over
You lie behind me
Your breath is heavy
You're sleeping
There are some screws
That are coming loose
From two holes in the wall
The plaster's sifting down
Resting like sleep-sand in my eyes
There's a cabinet
(Hanging over my bed)
Filled with all my secret things
(Filled with all my secret things)
Every night I lie
(Staring at it)
I'm so afraid that it will fall down
Onto my face
I know what is keeping
My cabinet from falling down
It's very a small bird
Made of ceramics
Fastened by a thread
To the bottom of the cabinet
When you're awake
You play around with it
Then I get so scared
That the thread won't be strong enough
I'm hiding my head under the pillow
Hoping that
The bird won't fly away
There's a cabinet
(Hanging above my bed)
Filled with all my secrets things
(Filled with secret things)
Every night I lie
(Staring up at it)
I'm so afraid that it will fall down
'Cause what if the cabinet
(Were to fall down)
And what if it hit my face
(Would you get frightened by)
The things that you would see
(The things that you would see)
Or would try to mend it
(Would you even try)
There's a cabinet
Hanging above my bed
Filled with secret things

Call it love and devotion
Call it the mom's adoration (foundation)
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single mums out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-Da-Paul, Anne-marie, sing, make them hear
She works the night, by the water
She's gonna stress, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)
She tells him "ooh love"
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you (stay up there, stay up there)
She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life (straight)
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do" (stay up there, stay up there)

Just see and know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you well prepared
And no mamma you never shed tear
'Cause you haffi set things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find the school fee and the bus fare
Hmmmm more when paps disappear

Steadily you work flow, heavily you know so you nah stop
No time no time fi a jeer
Now she gotta a six year old

Young girl in the market
Music to the men
When the men leave
Her eyes are red
When her eyes are closed again she sees the dark market of above
And she sings
'They say the most horrible things
But I hear violins, when I close my eyes
I am at the center of the sun
And I cannot be hurt
By anything this wicked world has done'
Young boy in the market
Follows all the men
When the men leave
He's out of his head
When his eyes are closed again he sees the dark market of above
And he sings
'They break the most beautiful things
But I hear violins, when I close my eyes
I am at the center of the sun
And I cannot be hurt
By anything this wicked world has done
I look into your eyes
And I am at the center of the sun
And I cannot be hurt
By anything this wicked world has done'
Center of the sun
Young boy in the market
Sees the girl alone
And asks her
'Have you lost your way home?'
She sings
'You say the most beautiful things, just like my violins'
I look into your eyes
I am at the center of the sun
And I cannot be hurt
By anything this wicked world has done
When I close my eyes
I am at the center of the sun
And I cannot be hurt
By anything this wicked world has done
'Cause
I hear violins
I hear violins
I hear violins
I hear violins
Center of the sun
I hear ...violins

A sudden passing rain let up and once again
The sky shines so beautiful, it seems unreal
I smile at you like this, you smile at me like that
I'm lost inside your eyes in pure bliss, right here
Like a little girl I try to cling on to your shirt
All it takes is just a touch to bring me back to earth
So now...
I know I'm falling more in love with you
There's nothing more I want but you
Hurts to keep it all inside, wanna show you how I feel
If I could make this summer dream come true, I'd wish to be with only you
No one else will ever do, let me show you that it's true
I've searched everywhere
For someone like you
So many memories trapped in photographs
We shared it all together over cold ice tea
The greatest memories are always bittersweet
Wishin' time would stop I don't want to say goodbye
As the sunset hits the ground I slowly walk away
From the distance I can see you waving back to me
And you're gone
I know I'm falling more in love with you
There's nothing more I want but you
I can't deny the pain inside, I wanna show you how I feel
I always dreamed of finding you like this, somebody to love like this
No one else will ever do, let me show you that it's true
And I touched the rain... So I need your love
I know I'm falling more in love with you
There's nothing more I want but you
I won't deny this thrill of mine, I wanna show you how I feel
Now finally I've met my dream come true, never thought it could be true
My love for you won't ever change, even if the summer ends
I've searched everywhere... For someone like you

There's a brown shirt swapped for a thin blue tie
There's a black truth swapped for a thin blue lie
There's a slim man sporting a clean cut dream
There's a slim man courting a wide extreme
There's a fly-blown flag in a dry-bone town
There will be no ships because they've all gone down
There's a man with a medal but he'll never sleep
There are guns in his head, they say the war was cheap
There are heaped up dreams on the mounds of slag
There are moped up tears as the hours drag
There's a suitcase gone and there's an empty drawer
There's a broken cup lying on the floor
There are questions asked in the house tonight
There's a wife been involved in a pillow fight
There's a husband there who she hardly knows
There's a patched up dream for a winter rose
There's a soft touch finally come to blows

Boys, boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)
Ice cold in the summer, iced tea in the winter
I don't allow myself to fall, but I fall every time that my heart's ever near ya
And I don't ever let 'em, spend a lot of time to forget 'em
'Cause I know what they say about these boys, they'll trip you when you fall, its a set up
So he's gorgeous, maybe he's a babe
But he ain't doing nothing but getting all in the way
Sweet nothings 'bout love will never ever mean a thing
Throw the bouquet, keep him away
There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
Try to live without them, but I'm stuck here in love again
There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
So d-damn distracting, I just can't take my mind off them, boys
Boys, boys, boys
Boys (two, three, four)
Fluid like water, spit mad game to your daughter
But I know what mama say "I'm 'bout to get burned if I'm playing with the fire"
So I don't ever let 'em, and when they cross the line, I check 'em
See the sparkle in my eyes, 'cause love is blind, it's just a matter of time 'til I friend them
So he's gorgeous, maybe he's a babe
But he ain't doing nothing but a getting all in the way
Sweet nothings 'bout love will never ever mean a thing
Throw the bouquet, keep him away
There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
Try to live without them, but I'm stuck here in love again
There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
So d-damn distracting, I just can't take my mind off them boys
Boys, boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)
Boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)
Boys like girls, sugar-sweet
Sweep 'em right up off they feet
Boys like girls who try to please
Show me that you're into me
I don't rush, I move with ease
Tell me that you love me but I won't believe
Stand (?) my ground by any means
Me, myself is all I need

Hey
Hey

Deus does not exist.
But if he does,
He lives in the sky above me,
In the fattest largest cloud up there.
He is whiter than white and cleaner than clean.
He wants to reach me.
Deus does not exist.
But if he does I always notice him.
Getting ready in his airy room.
He is picking his gloves so gently off.
He wants to touch me.
I'm walking humbly down a tiny street.
Pulling my collar it gets bigger.
I once met him.
It really surprised me.
He put me in a bath tub.
Made me squeeky clean.
Really clean.
To create a universe you must taste the forbidden fruit.
He said hi. I said hi.
I was still clean.
Deus does not exist.
But if he does he'd want to get down from that cloud.
First marzipan fingers than marble hands.
More silent than silence and slower than slow.
Diving towards me.
My collar is huge room for two hands,
They start at the chest and move slowly down.
I thought I had seen everything.
He wasn't white and fluffy.
He just had sideburns.
He just had sideburns. and a quiff.
He said hi. I said hi.
I was still clean.
I was squeeky clean.
I was surprised.
Just as you would be.
Deus deus.
He does not exist.
Deus deus.

I am strong in his hands
I am beyond me
On my own I'm human
And I do faults
I do confess
I feel you trickling
Down my shoulders
From above
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
I turn myself in
I give myself up
Volunteer
You own me : I'm yours
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
You have to trust it
I'm eternally yours
All that I gave them
I gave to you
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
So needy of comfort
But too raw to be embraced
Undo this privacy
And put me in my place
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Generous palm stroke
The hugest of hugs
Undo this privacy
Embrace
Embrace me
Embrace me
Embrace me
Eeeeeemmmmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
I am strong in his hands
I am above
Way beyond me
I, con
She's strong in his hands
She is beyond her
On her own she is human
And she does faults

Earth. A biosphere.
A complex,
Subtly balanced life support system.
Et turtur nidum,
Ubi reponat pullos suos
Altaria tua Domine virtutum,
Rex meus, et Deus meus
(and the turtledove a nest
Where it might place its young
Your altar of strengths, Lord,
My king and my God,)
We are floating over the line
Let us follow our mind
All of our life we'll wait for the answer
And the question is why
If we're following our mind
We can glide into light
No one knows if there'll be an answer
While we're morphing through time
We are floating over the line
Let us follow our mind
All of our life we'll wait for the answer
And the question is why
We're just travelers
In endless space
If we're following our mind
We can glide into light
No one knows if there'll be an answer
While we're morphing through time

I feel it move through me
I feel it move through me
Ride this rhythm
with me baby
Set your soul at ease
Let's communicate in
sonic frequencies
Free your mind of
all this negativity
We were made to move
and groove eternally
I feel it move through me
I feel it move through me
Ride this rhythm
with me baby
Show the world you're free
Let's express the
art of true humanity
Free your mind of
all this negativity
We were made to move
and groove eternally

Alright, we'll do this your way
Alright, we'll make it anyway
Now'd be a good time
To send us all away, man
So what would it take?
And what would it take
To make you learn?
And what would it take?
And what would it take
To make you listen?
Oh man, you're not the only one
Oh boy, with that phantom other on
Now'd be the right time
To send us all away
It'd be a good time
If you just go away, man
What would it take?
What would it take
To make you leave?
What would it take?
What would it take
To make you listen?
My God in Heaven
What were we thinking?
My God in Heaven
What were we thinking of?
Look out, look out now
We gotta get out now
Look out, look out now
We gotta get out now
Wake up, wake up now
We gotta get up now
Wake up, wake up now
We gotta get up now

My love is generations old,
I was there when trees died as the world went cold
Still there when my people were bought and sold
What's going on? What's going on?
[Dido]
Your love is on a grand scale
Mine is in the detail
Your love is to change the world
We just want to have to hold
Two hearts, both forgiving
Two ways to see the same thing
One house there's room for all
We just want to have to hold (2x)
[Maxi Jazz & Dido]
No roots, no tree, no family, no me
[Maxi Jazz]
Our first fuck was more planning than luck
I had a deep understanding of what makes you (hot)
I did my homework till my dome hurt, I was a stone flirt
Hustling for some prone work, and I don't stop
I knew that you were good for me,
You 'n I fit together so beautifully
But only for three years were we in harmony
I've ended up part you, part me,
Love that we agree, not be ugly
And now that we're free to create our own destiny
You will always be a friend to me
My love persists over land and sea, through centuries
I'll fill you up like rice and peas,
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.

[Verse 1]
Read between the lines
My self respect has died
You got me in a bind
I'll never be confined
[Chorus]
You make me
You break me
And maybe it's draining
[Bridge]
OK, you want it all the same
I will not be that way
I'll take it day by day [Repeat x2]
[Verse 2]
Fill me with your lies
A product of these times
I'll leave it all behind
I'll hunt from deep inside
[Chorus]
[Bridge: x2]

Remember when we were young
Breakin' every rule they made
I'll never change what we've done
It made us who we are today
I'm takin' every chance I get
To make us who you won't forget
Who we are, who we are
This is what we started
This is what we started
They can't hold us down
They'll never be, never be
Never be, never be us
This is what we started
Remember we used to run
To the corner of '69
Yeah they would come chasin' us
We found a new place to hide
Our makin' out plans to brake out
Give me your hand and then
They will know who we are
This is what we started
This is what we started
They can't hold us down
They'll never be, never be us
Never be, never be us
This is what we started
It's everything that we ever wanted
They won't hold us back
They'll never be, never be us
Never be, never be us
(This is what we started)
(It's everything that we ever wanted)

They fired off the first shot
So we're on our feet and runnin'
We're re-writing all the textbooks
In the process of becoming
There's so much to live for
If we stop putting up a fight
There's a place for every story
And this one starts with us tonight
Let me take you down
To Cafe Europa
There's so much to be found
So much to discover
Let me take you down
To Cafe Europa
There's so much to be found
I won't let you down
We're travelin' by moonlight
From London to the Highlands
We lose ourselves in inner cities
In the hope of re-defining
The space that surrounds us
All the emptiness within
It's all in the papers
The boy's in love again
Always arriving
Headlights lit up from coast to coast
Empty days full to bursting
With the names of the people and places
We miss the most
I'm taking the last train
Flyin' the last flight
I'm calling on the angels
And letting in the sunlight
Let me take you down
To Cafe Europa
There's so much to be found
So much to discover
Let me take you down
To Cafe Europa
There's so much to be found
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
Let me take you down
Let me take you down
To Cafe Europa
To Cafe Europa
There's so much to be found
So much to discover
Let me take you down
Cafe Europa
Cafe Europa
It's the heart that has been broken
Finds the truth in what is spoken
Cafe Europa
Cafe Europa
Let me take you down

You're only two and the whole wild world revolves around you,
And nothing happened yet that you might ever wish to forget.
It doesn't stay that way, if I could I'd make stay that way.
And this you will recall in after years,
Though you may weary of this vale of tears -
These days remember, always remember.
You're only two and I've no wish to worry you,
So pay no mind to those who say the world is unkind -
That's just something they've read,
And if I could I'd strike them dead.
And this you will recall in after years,
Though you may weary of this vale of tears -
These days remember, always remember.
And honey there's no rush,
The world will wait for you to grow up.
And this you will recall in after years,
Though you may weary of this vale of tears -
These days remember, always remember.
I hope you never change,
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James;
Don't ever change,
I'll call you Jimmy, they call you James.

Come and dance, come
I was all alone, going for a ride
Travelling solo, off my guard
I had to follow this calling from the wild
Into the shadows
Into the shadows of my heart
I needed all my strength to
Stand up to your agenda
I said it, I said it again
I never wanna become
Stuck in your machine
I said it, I said it again
Come and dance, come
And as I moved on, thought I'd blow my mind
But as it turned out, I was wrong
I met my sorrow, saw her in the eyes
She tried my courage
She tried my courage, but left me stronger
(You better stand up straight and you gotta be strong
You gotta fight for your right and reclaim your own song)
I needed all my strength to
Stand up to your agenda
I said it, I said it again
I never wanna become
Stuck in your machine
I said it, I said it again
Come and dance, come

Try to keep up with me
'Cause I can give you some
All the loving you need
I give you such a rush
Baby step up your game
Keep up with my pace
Girl I know that you want it
Don't hesitate
I want you behind my bedroom doors
Ready or not, we're about to speed up
Try to keep up with me (me , me, me)
'Cause I can give you some, oh oh
All the loving you need (need, need, need)
I give you such a rush (rush , rush)
Baby step up your game (game, game, game)
Keep up with my pace (pace, pace)
Girl I know that you want you want, you want, want it
Don't hesitate
I want you behind my bedroom doors
Ready or not, we're about to speed up
I'm lovin' you girl (3x)
Try to keep up with me (me , me, me)
'Cause I can give you some, oh oh
All the loving you need (need, you need, need)
I give you such a rush (rush , rush)
Baby step up your game (game, game, game)
Keep up with my pace (pace, pace)
Girl I know that you want (you want, you want, want it)
Don't hesitate
I want you behind my bedroom doors
Ready or not, we're about to speed up
I'm lovin' you girl (2x)

Memory comes when memory's old
I am never the first to know
Following the stream up North
Where do people like us float
There is room in my lap
For bruises, asses, hand claps
I will never disappear
For Forever, I'll be here
Whispering
Morning, keep the streets empty for me
I laying down eating snow
My fur is hot, my tongue is cold
On a bed of spider web
I think of how to change myself
A lot of hope in a one man tent
There's no room for innocence
So Take me home before the storm
Velvet mites will keep us warm
Whispering
Morning, keep the streets empty for me
Uncover our heads and reveal our souls
We were hungry before we were born

A sudden rush of expectation
As I realise it's you
Like a river in a droughtful season
How cool you didn't call
Initial hint of disappointment
The mirror of my smile
That isn't there, that doesn't follow
A very causal 'hi'
Why did you come at all,
If it wasn't for me?
Another blow of resignation
When realise I do
Now in your hands
The book you borrowed
The whole way we first met
Comes together in my head,
When the picture's clear you've left

I lift you off the earth mundane and glum
Out of solar system where you passed the sun
'Til all the fear in your hart is gone and so on
Walking trough the world with no pressure
Inner peace beyond measure
I was leaving where it came in
When a man said stop
I want to have what you have
And get what you got
I got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learning to share my peoples pain
I got it making flowers grow in hearts of stone
I got it 'cause I always take thee long way home
I've been walking trough the world with no pressure
As fresher full of vigour life becomes my mirror
The further I go the more I know
Oh yeah, wherever the wind blow I'll be there
Turned up in places that I never intended to go
And so ended my youth I once deepended on proof
Now I'm in the flow, there I things I know beyond knowing
I've seen a seed growing, I was going back home
When a man said stop, I want to have what you have
And get what you got
I got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learning to share my peoples pain
I got it making flowers grow in hearts of stone
I got it 'cause I always take thee long way home

Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood
From the suicide of the Lisbon girls.
People saw their clairvoyance
In the wiped-out elms and harsh sunlight.
Some thought the torture tearing the Lisbon girls
Pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world
As it was handed down to them, so full of flaws.
But the only thing we are certain of
After all these years, is the insufficiency of explanations.
Obviously doctor,
You've never been a thirteen year-old girl.
The Lisbon girls were thirteen,
Cecile, fourteen, Lux, fifteen, Bonnie, sixteen, Mary, and seventeen, Therese.
No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon,
A math teacher, had produced such beautiful creatures.
From that time one, the Lisbon house began to change.
Almost every day, and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on her towel wearing a swimsuit
That caused the knife-sharpener to give her a fifteen minute demonstration for free.
The only reliable boy who got to know Lux was Trip Fontaine
For only 18 months before the suicides had emerged from baby fat
To the delight of girls and mothers alike.
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.
The girls were pulled out of school,
And Mrs. Lisbon shut the house for maximum security isolation.
The girls' only contact to the outside world
Was through the catalogs they ordered
That started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
With pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.
Unable to go anywhere, the girls traveled in their imaginations
To gold-tipped Siamese temples or past an old man,
The leaf broom tidying the Maw's carpeted speck of Japan ?
And Cecelia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
We couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds,
But they were slipping away.
The colors of their eyes were fading,
Along with exact locations of moles and dimples.
From five, they had become four,
And they were all (the living and the dead), become shadows.
We would have lost them completely if the girls hadn't contacted us.
Lux was the last to go.
Fleeing from the house, we forgot to stop at the garage.
After the suicide free-for-all,
Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.
They had Mr. Henry pack up the house,
Selling what furniture he could at a garage sale.
Everyone went just to look.
Our parents did not buy used furniture,
And they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death.
We of course took the family photos that were put out with the trash.
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
And it was sold to a young couple from Boston.
It didn't matter in the end how old they had been,
Or that they were girls.
But only that we had loved them,
And that they hadn't heard us call, still did not hear us.
Calling out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time,
Alone in suicide.
Which is deeper than death,
And where we will never find the pieced to put them back together.

There We Were
Alone Naked Rusty IERA Tonight...

Alone Naked Rusty IERA
There We Stood
Alone Naked Rusty IERA Tonight...
Tonight... (x8)
IERA Again Tonight My Love

There's someone out there selling one way tickets to the edge of the world...
Yeah, I think I'll go around and buy me some.
'Cause I can't even find my peace while listening to the radio,
No....the songs, some sing about us.
Why me, why now?
Thought I had it figured out but my heart wont shut down.
Why me why now?
I'll be caught red-handed when love comes around.
I wish I never met you I was doing fine all on my own...till you came passing by.
I wish I stayed not never knowing how emotions really feel...this is real.
The rules just don't apply.
Why me, why now?
Thought I had it figured out but my heart won't shut down.
Why me, why now?
I'll be caught red-handed when love comes around.

A touch too much, too soon,
Got cast away with you.
Got cast away with you.
Your words, can't hear, cause they hurt,
Can't spend another day with you.
Can't stand another day with you.
These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
It's like you are hopelessly in love,
But I will watch you.
It's like you are hopelessly in love.
Don't move, just close your eyes,
I grab your hands and then (x2
You see, although you've been blind,
I saved your world again.
Just saved your world again.
These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
It's like you are hopelessly in love,
But I will watch you.
It's like you are hopelessly in love.
But it's okay, okay,
'Cause I will stay with you.
You don't need much operation done,
You want the moon but you've got the sun.
You don't need much operation done,
Too much, too soon, for a bit of fun.
These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
But it's okay, okay,
'Cause I will stay with you.

Yeah, I keep dreaming
That I have it all
I'm still craving
To have you by my side
I know our love is fading
But soon it will shine
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head
And in my brain it's going wrong
And I will live today
And I will live tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
You're burning out my head
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
You're burning out my head
I keep searching
But soon we will shine
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head
And in my brain it's going wrong
And I will live today
And I will live tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
Even if it's going wrong
You're burning out my head
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out my head

But you don't seem to share my impatience

I cannot understand your reluctance

Give me some more of the warm little beasts
I'm so fond of
You seem so
I could melt the frozen wall you raised between us
and now I'm on the other side, you seem rather surprised
Constricting viscous rings around your warm body
Holding you tied, holding you tied... and I feel so happy
You seem so tender
As the warm little beasts
I'm so fond of

I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deeper
Into this thing
The deeper I go
The more knowledge I know
What to sing
What to bring
Wha
I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deeper, deeper, deeper
Into the rhyme
Chillin' in the corner at the shelter all by myself
Checkin it out I'm not dancin' no more but
Why? why? why? wha
How on earth are you supposed to vibe around the fake ones
The one, the ones that say
They know what is what but they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deeper
Into this thing
And I pretend that they're not there
I just stare
Up in the booth at the dread man spinnin the song
Spinnin it strong
Playing things like
We cannot house we can
That's my shit
What?
Whoooooo!
I get deep, I get deep, I get deeper, I get deeper
When people start to disappear
And it's about six o'clock
Whoo I'm feelin' hot
Take off my sweater and my pants
And I start to dance
And all the sweat just goes down my face
And I pretend that there's nobody there but me in this place
I get deep, oh I get deep
I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deep
He takes all the bass out of the song
And all you hear is highs and its like
Oh, shit!
Ahh
I get deeper
I get deep, I get deep, I get deep, I get deep
And the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol
And I get drunk and I oh all over the place
And I catch myself
Right on time
Right on line
With the beat
And its so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
I get deeper
I get deeper
I get deeper
If the house music was ale
And Doctor love would be my song
And I would only take deep breaths
And fill my lungs with the rhythm or the bass
I get deep
Now it's about three and I see people goin'
Spinnin' jumpin' and grindin'
As if they had wings on their feet
Raising both hands in the air as if Jesus was the DJ himself
Spinnin those funky funky funky house beats
And in this temple we all pray in unity for the same thing
With matic pause without cause
Bass from those high definition speakers
Sitting in the corner on each side of the room
Givin' us the boom boom boom
To our zoom zoom zoom
The smell of a L lit while walking by
But the music gets me high
Saint defy like and old lady in church
We get happy
We stomp our feet
We clap our hands
We shout
We cry
We dance
And we say
Sweet Lord, speak to me
Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me
Because we love house music
And on this planet it brings us together
Like a family reunion every week
We eat
We drink
We laugh
We play
And we skate
So for all you hip hoppers
You do woppers
Name droppers
You bill boppers
Come into our house
To get deep
You guys just keep it rollin'
You gotta just keep it rollin'
(x19)
Sunday, Monday morning (its backwards)
Out under the big bright yellow sun (x40)

The way move & Grind on me,
You drive me crazy you're something I need,
You are like a drug so addicted to you,
You say you want me I want you too.
Yooooooooooooou are so damn fine,
And another one like like like like
Yooooooooooooou is so hard to find,.

I look toward the ocean
see reflections on the water
a glossy illumination
of the city lights
far out in the waves
is the shape of a whale
hear it singing its old song
like it has always done
it was just a dream
which comes and goes
as do the old seasons
while the wind still blows
it will take a hundred years
waiting for the summer
and no one just yet knows
if we'll hear the whales again
nuclear winter covers the world
for almost 20 years
all what we own are dreams
and hope for the next generation
chorus:
open the door, step outside
walk on the frozen ground
look in the sky - a grey cloud
winter is still around

Your booty move, your booty move
It's so easy to get acid, you can get it anywhere.
If you don't make your booty move, your booty must be dead

You've come around, you've come for more
I don't believe we've met before
Forget the day we saw the end
Just come and fall in love again
Here's where it starts
The same place, the same breaking hearts
And where it ends
We'll meet here and fall apart again
I'll stay a while to watch you sleep
The sun is fading and so are we
I'll stay a while to watch it end
Then break your heart to know I can
The first time that I learned I could make you cry
Was just like how I thought you looked inside
The last time will be one night of whispered lies
The last time that I'll pretend you could be mine

My baby blue is a new star,
In the sky,
The world the world the world the world,
Just for you for nobody else.

How do I feel for thee?
You smell of great disease
'Cause we're young
Fell in from the stars
When your skin is dead
On a pile of your head
Now then, I look so smart
Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate
Heaven should interfere
I'm coming from your tears
When they wander into their cage
So their arms and thighs
And their holy covered eyes
Just yet, will never age
Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate
Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate
Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate
Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Make you participate, okay

Found money and fame
But I found them really late
So in my mansion I'd sit
Waiting for it all to end
My material, my friends
I made lots of friends
I made lots and lots of friends
And on me did they depend
See the horror on my face
I can finally leave this place
Over Blue Star Moonbeam Trace
I can't remember my address

The days count me down
Hit's close to home now and I don't
So I'll pause like it sunk in
But I don't listen, I never listen
It'd break your heart were
I killed by a tidal wave
An ocean away torn apart by the coral
Trying to breathe
This hope to grow old is a joke now
And it gets funnier every time I tell it
So here we are now broken school boys
In love with a girl who is no more alive than I

Being here in the darkness, starless sky
It's quieter than a church before the crowds arrive
And the world is mine
And no one else sees with my thanks and love in my thoughts
And wishes to give and to ask
It's a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
With the years doors have been locked and windows closed
And the things I'm sure I knew are no longer due
But I see comfort in my home in my heart
To make a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
And above me
If there is nothing and no one knew I really care
It's just a now, a now I prefer
Not the future and not the past
So put the chairs to one side and let us dance
It's a strange kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
It's a strange kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
Being here in the darkness, starless sky
It's quieter than a church before the crowds arrive
And the world is mine
And no one else sees with my thanks and love in my thoughts
And wishes to give and to ask
It's a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace

Lung of love, leaves me breathless
Tongue of fool lap me in enmity
Four walled secret lies among the hessian and
A flicker of the future could of saved the cindered sister
And I'm motioning still
They stand inside me
And moments until
The one I leave
Colorless I kiss her cold forehead
I feel life
Loose it in a minute
And the ones to come feel too far to care
And I'm motioning still
They stand inside me
And moments until
The one I leave
People concertina to my private magic lantern move for me
With the senses all inclusive
In the theater of triggered memories
Motioning still
They stand inside me
And moments until
The one I leave
The one I leave
Moments until
The one I leave
The one I leave
The one I leave
The one I leave

If one kiss led to another, baby
I'm ready to forgive you honey
There's a light that shines between us
And it's worth the crying, lady
I was falling on sharp stones then
And my bones were cracking daily
No more weeping and lying now
And I'm holding you forever
And I'm holding you forever
[Chorus]
Love love Lord above
Save us from the push and shove
Let us blend together
Find us and forgive us
Love love Lord above
Save us from the push and shove
Let us blend together
Find us and forgive us
Time they say, is the great healer
But I believe in chemicals baby
When the waves come crashing in
We are closer now than ever
We are closer now than ever
There was a cold space between us
Still we bridged that chasm lady
Desire love and friendship
We are sanctified together
We are sanctified together
[Chorus]
Love love Lord above
Save us from that push and shove
Love love Lord above
Save us from that push and shove
Love love Lord above
Save us from that push and shove
Love love Lord above
Save us from that push and shove
Love love Lord above
Love love Lord above
Love love Lord above
Save us from that push and shove
[Chorus]
Love
Love
Love
Love

I'm more dope than heroin, sharper than a needle
I'm more dope than heroin, sharper than a needle
Maybe I'm a loverboy, hooked on an aphrodisiac
Maybe I'm a strange one, maybe I'm a twisted maniac
Hey, you never can tell
Maybe you can touch the taste by the sense of smell
Who's to say that heaven is in hell
Escaping reality's touch
Just in time ? just in time before the bite gets too much
Who's to say that heaven is in hell? Can this be hell?
Maybe I'm a loverboy, hooked on an aphrodisiac
Or maybe I'm a strange one, maybe I'm a twisted maniac
Hey, you never can tell
Maybe you can touch the taste by the sense of smell
Who's to say that heaven is in hell
Can this be hell, oh well, oh well, oh well
Escaping reality?s touch, yeah
Now just in time before the bite gets too much
Hey, hey, hey, you never can tell
I said, said, hey, you never can tell
Maybe you can touch the taste by the sense of smell
I said maybe you can touch the taste by the sense of smell
Who's to say that heaven is in hell
Can this be hell, oh well, oh well, oh well
Escaping reality?s touch
Just in time before the bite gets too much
I'm more dope than heroin, sharper than a needle
I'm more dope than heroin, sharper than a needle
Sharper than a needle
I'm sharper than a needle
Sharper than a needle, needle, needle, needle, no
Yeah, sharper than a needle
Yeah, sharper than a needle
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you never can tell
Maybe you can touch the taste by the sense of smell
Who's to say that heaven is in hell
Can this be hell? Oh well, oh well, oh well
Escaping reality's touch
Yeah, just in time ? just in time before the bite gets too much

Well he never thought that he could feel this way
And he never knew the pain he'd bring that day
Never telling her he had too much to drink
She got in the car and he just drove away
Never thinking of the life that he could lose
All the choices that we make can break us too
Too young to say goodbye
Too many hearts left broken
Too young to ever learn or see what life could bring
A mother left alone
With no one to come home to
Another lesson learned from teenage tragedy
As the rain was coming down he couldn't see
All the lights went out the sky was filled with grey
As the car slid off the road his life would change
As he screams to god 'you should have taken me'
Never thinking of the life that he will lose
All the choices that you make can break us too
Too young to say goodbye
Too many hearts left broken
Too young to ever learn or see what life could bring
A mother left alone
With no one to come home to
Another lesson learned from teenage tragedy
Too young to say goodbye
Too many hearts left broken
Too young to ever learn or see what life could bring
A mother left alone
With no one to come home to
Another lesson learned from teenage tragedy
Too young to say goodbye
Too many hearts left broken
Too young to ever learn or see what life could bring
A mother left alone
With no one to come home to
Another lesson learned from teenage tragedy

King Tubby died today,
Struck down by a careless cliche.
The Hitman had to say it was an error,
He was aiming for the airplay.
Is there hope, in being ahead of our time?
Brother can you spare me a bassline?
How come you've got pre-pubescents fainting,
When Van Gogh died before he sold a painting.
Now time keeps on slipping,
And we're to blame.
While the pioneers are starving in J.A.
So we spied like a fly on the wall,
Deep within the halls of the record companies.
And they know it is poor,
But what the hell, it's going to get "A" listed.
Now we've hit on 24 tracks,
Before the ink is dry upon the contracts.
We've a dream of Marx & Lenin,
Drowning in a sea of snow-washed denim.
Why should the masters innovate,
When every time we come along & rob them?
And well may you shrug & renovate,
If you're not part of the solution,
You're part of the problem

All these accidents
That happen
Follow the dot
Coincidence
Makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel
Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
All that no-one sees
You see
What's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts
You heal
Deep inside of me, oo-oohh
You don't have to speak
I feel
Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me confuse
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
State of, state of
How beautiful
Emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be

What's that you're saying there
Oh well
Rain rushing window pain
Oh well
Can't see what space i'm in
Oh well
But i'm safe inside me here
Oh well

It will take some time for me
To get the point of what
Was wrong with this
I saw it was
Too many cold
Too many scared
And bold and failed
Turn on the lights
And watch me run
You will follow me to the end
You will see
I will take care of everything
And I will make you better off
I assure you
And you won't even be around
And you won't say a word to cope
And I will ask the better ones
How come you lie
How come you ain't a part of us
You will see
And you will always watch for me
You will see
And you will always watch for me
Turn on the lights
And watch me run
You will follow me to the end
You will see
And you will always watch for me
I will take care of everything
And I will make you better off
I assure you
You will see me
You will see
And you will always watch for me
You will see me
Turn on the lights
And watch me run
You will follow me to the end
You will see
I will take care of everything
And I will make you better off
I assure you
You will see
You will see
You will see
You will see me.

Greed's all gone now, there's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ear
Regain your balance
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight
For the love of that girl
Greed's all gone now, panic subsides
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Try to put myself on the inside
Of the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl
Promise is never over, never questions that needed reply
But she could breathe deep into my neck
Let me know I'm just on the outside
Of the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl
Greed's all gone now, there's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears
Regain your balance
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight
For the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl

I can't sayâ?¦
It's ever been easy watching time go byâ?¦
While everybody finds somebodyâ?¦
I say â??no love, no cryâ??
I believe the words to every sad song on the radioâ?¦
Could love be a stranger? Heartache can't change it.
Now I've found you, I'll never let you goâ?¦
CHORUS
Now, I'll never let a day go byâ?¦
A day without your loveâ?¦
I never can say goodbyeâ?¦
I'll never give up on youâ?¦
I'm living in a perfect worldâ?¦
And you're the reason whyâ?¦
Oh, oh, oh, why?
I'll never let a day go byâ?¦
I'm now saying I can be certainâ?¦
Somewhere in my mindâ?¦
Somebody up there brought us togetherâ?¦
Same place, same timeâ?¦
I used to tell myselfâ?¦
I can be strong and live my life aloneâ?¦
I must have been lyingâ?¦
My heart was cryingâ?¦
'Till you came and made it your homeâ?¦
Now Iâ?¦

Hey what's this?
Yea, excellent I love this kind of stuff
Is this your track or is this?
Hey, have you just put some ? ? ?
No longer any place mother nature can hide now
Far from space culture
Dazzling, spacial
That the instant the omega point's reached ...
With gain control of all matter and forces
Now all mean a single universe
But in all universes it's existence is logically possible
Life will have spread to all spacial regions in all universes
Which can logically exist
We have stored an infinite amount of information
Including all this knowledge which is logically possible to know
No longer any place mother nature can hide
Far from space culture
Exude your phenomena, exude the phenomena
Turn it on, dazzling, spacial
My calendar, the most concentric figuration of recorded time
You know the axis of the northern star shifts like two inches every year
And it ends near 2000 and 11 on the nears of 2011th on the last half of hour
Is aaa when time speeds up
Come back, dazzling, spacial
Distant cosmos

Sometimes we seize the day
A harlot's game they try to play
To take our lives and eat them up with false pride
Make it go away
So make it go away
The twisted secret out to make us weak
Become not his in vain
At least we'll never go away!
go away..go away..go away..
It's evilution!

This is the life I know
The sun never seems to shine
There's nowhere else to go
But I keep looking towards the sky
When the falling rain becomes my only friend,
Can't help but think there's more to this life
But I keep my head up high
Here we go, here we go again
You're looking at me like I'm your only friend
The ocean glistens with the timeless age
The rain starts to fall on my face
It seems my luck has run out
It seems this was a lie
I'll fill this glass one more time
It always felt like it was right
Where is my luck tonight?
Oh, I want to hear you sigh
(Please reply, angels are falling from the sky)
Where ever we may go
(We never talk like we never did)
The sun never seems to shine
(Who is this that I'm talking to?)
But I keep looking up I hope
(This looks like the end, so on that bitter note)
Not a soul on our side
(Hold me tight, because in my mind)
But we'll make it out alright
(We die together in a flash of light)
Where was our luck tonight?
We'll break free
I was quick to give you away
Didn't want to feel you so soon
I've lost something I never ever had

These hands
Like strangers in the wind
These eyes
Float in the breeze
These hands
Like strangers in the wind
This voice
Calling to me
These hands
Like strangers in the wind
These eyes
Float in the breeze
Run to the lights of the city
These moments pass and we'll be there
(And she looks good)
Run to the lights of the city
(And she looks good)
This dance will last us forever
Forever
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
Run to the lights of the city
These moments pass and we'll be there
(And she looks good)
Run to the lights of the city
(And she looks good)
This dance will last us forever
Forever

'Bout a month ago, I've never seen your face -
I've never heard your voice. 'Bout a month ago.
I'm a careful hunter and I have to say -
Before I found your love. 'Bout a month ago.
Are you my boy or the flowerstand man -
You bought such color to this place.
Are you my boy or the flowerstand man -
With you I'm laid back.
I don't care if every river runs so dry.
I don't care if every species were to die.
I don't care about the ozone layer -
I wouldn`t notice if it wasn`t there, oh no.
I don't care if we sell - coke to Africa.
I don't care about apartheid.
I wouldn't notice if it all get better.
I don't care about the starving who've died.

Backwater
We're sailing at the edges of time
Backwater
We're drifting at the waterline
Oh we're floating in the coastal waters
You and me and the porter's daughters
Ooh what to do not a sausage to do
And the shorter of the porter's daughters
Dips her hand in the deadly waters
Ooh what to do in a tiny canoe
Black water
There were six of us but now we are five
We're all talking
To keep the conversation alive
There was a senator from Ecuador
Who talked about a meteor
That crashed on a hill in the south of Peru
And was found by a conquistador
Who took it to the emperor
And he passed it on to a Turkish guru
His daughter
Was slated for becoming divine
He taught her
He taught her how to split and define
But if you study the logistics
And heuristics of the mystics
You will find that their minds rarely move in a line
So it's much more realistic
To abandon such ballistics
And resign to be trapped on a leaf in a vine

Shall I go, shall I stay
107 light years away
Many times, so many doubts
But no reason to talk about
Mission is over, mission is done
I will miss you, children of the sun
But it's time to go away
Goodbye milky way
For a better world without hate
Follow your heart, believe in fate
Only visions and the mind
Will guide you to the light
Mission is over mission is done
I will miss you children of the sun
But it's time to go away
Goodbye milky way
Mission is over, mission is done
I will miss you children of the sun
I go home until someday
I say goodbye, goodbye milky way
In 5 bilions years the
Andromeda galaxy will collide with our milky way
A new gigantic Cosmic world will be born

White bird in a black cloud
You flept, eyes rolled back
Medicine gave you a heart attack
Big flight for a small ride
First flight into white light
Pull the trigger love at first flight
Big plan for a big man
Tough change for a tough guy
Teaching out the corner of your eye
White bird in a black cloud
Rain comin' down, thinking hey
maybe we should turn this boat around
Heaven - maybe freedom
What''s the word? Right, I forgot
Quiet is the closest thing we got

Electric, I feel you
I feel you, oh
Start line, fall down
For you, oh
And I never wanted to let you go
To hold someone
Somebody else, no
Breaking hearts everywhere you go
Tell me where you go
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love
Star sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Ill be giving it all
Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold
No one, before you
No one, no
Sky falls, around you
Before I, let go
And I never wanted to let you go
To hold someone
Somebody else, no
Breaking hearts everywhere you go
Tell me where you go
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love
Star sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Ill be giving it all
Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold
Star sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Ill be giving it all
Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold

the butter flowers are in bloom.
but you're staying in.
The beauty that you know from before
don't mean a thing now
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.
there are others way to love than to love a man.
Other ways to fill your life
with meaning.
maybe there's a city somewhere
where you won't feel alien.
if new friends are waiting for you
go sail with them.
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.
loving you is like waiting for the rain to come.

Although I don't really know how to handle you
I will have nobody kicking no sand in your face
Not even a trace of bland in you
Teenage and it's a trouble understanding you
You got plenty of energy and stamina
Forgot all the little tricks I tried to cram in you
There's a bit of, 'I don't give a damn' in you, ha
And that's your old man in you
Stand in your way, never or ever abandon ya
And on the day people say what they can't stand in ya
Don't let your ego get out of hand on ya
It ain't a good look when crook-kharma land on ya
Balance yourself, bring out the Zinedine Zidane in you
The I will and I can in you
Execute the grand plan in you
I'm your daddy and happy to see the man in you
Might know too much but I'm no soft touch
Brought you up, to recognize lies as such
I need no crutch, child hood was arduous
And if there is a God I'm sure He would pardon us
Must be working hard in us, not to harden us
Ten, that you really wanna be
Twenty, exactly what you see is on telly
Eleven, you can't tell him anything
That he don't know already
Twelve, they get together steady
Explore the first keeping up with the many
Thirteen, none of them are ready
Living on old raised broke not a penny
Fourteen, baby in the belly
She's all done a runner another no daddy
Fifteen, Nanny and she loves it dearly
Head strong proving all along but wary
Sixteen, scale we were quite contrary
This is how the garden grows
This is how the garden grows
Children, you still own the power
To turn this into your finest hour
Now a young ma mum that mistake
Can make a contribution why don't we wait and see
Give back the mothers their dignity
And the fathers who roam free a lesson in humility
This society needs to learn empathy
It happened to you, it could happen to me
It happened to you, it could happen to me
It happened to you, it could happen to me
It happened to you, it could happen to me
Birds and bees without flowers
Girls be strong, boys don't cower
Stand by your seat, scream and shower
Oh, how the sweet can turn sour
Birds and bees without flowers
Girls be strong, boys don't cower
Stand by your seat, scream and shower
Oh, how the sweet can turn sour

Why must virgins drink the blood of a monkeys erect member
Possibly
Possibly
Never ending aquatic love throughout the ocean
Oh so jolly
Oh so raunchy
Step onto my boat here
Here
Here
There
Oh yes
I love that flavour

I'm tellin' ya, I can not wait for this band to come on,
Because I've got a few left over here,

So Irvine, I'll bring it home, a one two

And then we're sending for the Chemical Brothers

You'll need some kind of saint to pull those
Impure thoughts right out your head
Love the poor complexity
You wouldn't want it any other way
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more, a little bit
Just beating during the sun
Defibrillated hearts with every pulse
Without your own defiling
You'd backwards circle right above our heads
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more, a little bit
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more, a little bit
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
We've had to cross the line
Despite the fact our feet dipped in the fire
We pressured a bull again
Then shake your tambourines into the dust
You need some kind of saint
To pull those impure thoughts right out your head
Like the poor complexity
You wouldn't want it any other way
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
(Don't stop)
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
(Don't stop)
Giving it a little bit more
(Don't stop)
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
(Don't stop)
Giving it a little bit more
(Don't stop)
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
(Don't stop)
Giving it a little bit more
(Don't stop)
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
(Don't stop)
Giving it a little bit more
(Don't stop)
Climbin' on, climb on aboard

The unfolding of the year
And now our season is here
All the balances are clear
Now that our time is here
In a perfect present tense
Through our wide, rose tinted lens
When the words have all been spent
Will we still have meant them?
Through the window, see the place
Like a fond and sweet embrace
For a moment face to face
In the sweetest embrace
The unfolding of the year
And now our season is here
All the balances are clear
Now that our time is here

I ran into her on computer camp
Was that in '84, not sure
I had my commodore 64
Had to score
(Not with a -- tramp)
She's not a tramp
Her name is Judy
That's a nice name
Yeah she's a nice girl
Big deal
Did you get in her pants
She's not that kind of a girl booger
Why, does she have a penis
Seen as supremus
You better know she's a genus and a Venus
Tell me more was it love at first sight
That's right this was god giving grace with a face you could praise
Tell me more did you put up a fight
I don't think so but before we tour the chorus stall let's all explore a more a
Computer cabin war
That right
I said before we explore the amore on my story do a dora
Computer cabin war
Seen as supremus
You better know she's a genus and a Venus
Tell me more was it love at first sight
That's right this was god giving grace with a face you could praise
Tell me more did you put up a fight...
I ran into her on computer camp
Computer cabin war
Hard core
It started like a boar ending up on the floor
Come on now tell me more
Seen as supremus
You better know she's a genus and a Venus
Tell me more was it love at first sight
That's right this was god giving grace with a face you could praise
Tell me more did you put up a fight...

I can feel your skin on mine
I smell your body I smell your lust
We play this game of forbidden pleasures
I feel your warm lips on my mouth
[Chorus] 2x
We're praying for salvation
But we can't regret our sins
We're only slaves to our temptation
And we hurt the ones we love
We know everything is wrong
But you can't stop touching me
We're diving in a sea of lust
I wish this moment will last forever
[chorus] 2x

Ghastly protector
Save me from this waste
He's drifting asleep faster
Drowning the waves of rye
Spinnin' round the ballroom floor
Round and round the ballroom floor
Never seen but always saught after
After, after
Ghastly protector
Save me from this waste
He shakes me up like no other
Laughing in my face
He's mouthing off like a bastard
Drowning in those waves of rye
Spinnin' round the ballroom floor
Round and round the ballroom floor
Never seen but always saught after
After, after

I can sense it
Something important
Is about to happen
It's coming up
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big time sensuality
We just met
And I know I'm a bit too intimate
But something huge is coming up
And we're both included
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big time sensuality
I don't know my future after this weekend
And I don't want to!
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big time sensuality

Your voice, your words
Echo wherever I go
Your touch it hurts
You're so far away when you close
And I can't take it another day
I can show you any other way
If I told you "would it make you stay?"
Make you stay, make you stay
You don't even know it
That your love is mine
I'm ready to show it
That your love is mine
You don't even know It
You don't even know it
That your love is mine
I'm ready to show it
That your love is mine
Each step we take
Is pushing you further from me
I dream awake
Your shadow refuses to leave
And I can't take it another day
I can show you any other way
Cause I always been too afraid
But I won't let you slip away
I got you in my mind
Your heart, your kiss
You stuck in my head
Your touch is bliss
I'm running outta time
I'm running outta time
I'm running outta time
To make you see
You don't even know it
That your love is mine
I'm ready to show it
That your love is mine
You don't even know it
You don't even know it
That your love is mine
I'm ready to show it
That your love is mine
You don't even know it
That your love is mine
I'm ready to show it
That your love is mine
You don't even know it

Hanayo lives in Berlin cos she says the rent is cheap
Couldn't afford that lifestyle, Tokyo's too fast and steep
Juergen lives in Munich, that cozy comfy town
Got a nice BM that he drives all over town
Mimi lives in Hamburg, that fishy harbour breeze
She says it's the best place in the world
And then she starts to sneeze
dean lives in London, does the music business thing
He likes to take girls to the park
And do that sweet, sweet thing
People and places, people in different towns
Erkki lives in tampere, now where the hell is that?
works the web like no other, gotta put him on the map
Weasel she's in New York, she got it all set up
she drinks her frappuccio from a glass and not a cup
Jeremy moved to Rome, Italiano style
Gave up all that fashion jazz and says that with a smile
Russell lives in Cov, that a really brutal place
It's in the middle of England, right into your face
People and places and places and people

So many people looking for happiness
Expecting more of a brighter day
You'd sell your soul running from loneliness
Instead of giving yourself away
[Chorus:]
When you're walking in the sky
Heaven's holding hands with you
So you better learn to fly
Before you're falling through
'cause I'm walking in the sky
Heaven's holding hands with me
Now I think I've learned to fly
I'm happy just to be
You guide me here asking the question why
I used to close every open door
I'd find the sun even on cloudy skies
I've had my time and I don't need more
'cause I'm walking in the sky
Heaven's holding hands with me
Now I think I've learned to fly
I'm happy just to be
I'm happy just to be
Cause I'm walking in the sky
Now I think I've learned to fly

I may be wrong, I may be right

You run on the floor,
Feels like dancing is the way to go,
But if you let her see that fancy footwork
Show her that you're not that shy,
Let her see that fancy footwork
Show her you're that type of guy.
Two step, two step, two step
Two step, two step, two step
Young boy don't be late,
This girl ain't really got time to wait,
You think its all for show,
But this is just the only way I know,
But if you let her see that fancy footwork
Show her that you're not that shy,
Let her see that fancy footwork
Show her you're that type of guy.
Two step, two step, two step
Two step, two step, two step

A partner for the week

And maybe do the work,
So show me what you got in terms,
Of fancy footwork.

You think you're bad, but I'm badder than you
'Cause mine has come through consideration,
While your reaction is nothing new
So go on genius, be who you are
You're so flat and one dimensional
[Chorus:]
If you go my way, you won't go wrong
You'll find out where you really belong
If you search it out, it will make you strong
Then you'll go on and on and on and on
You want what's mine, but you don't deserve it
One tenth is all you can have
Why care, why share?
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
Why care, why share?
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
[Chorus]

Walking in
Walking out
Walking into my life
Stepping in
Stepping out
Stepping into my life
You can do what you want
But get into my life
Alright, alright, alright
Every single morning
I get on up and do my thing
Work for my money
But with you, I could go insane
Oh yes I, I've been on my way

You were someone to believe in
A place for hope in a changing world
Feeling every moment
Every one of the years spent in your arms
After a lifetime of living
These soiled hands show no life at all
Working at all hours
Never facing the fears here in my heart
Grieving for the loss of heaven
Weeping for the loss of heaven
By the wailing wall
You were someone to believe in
Giving life where there was a will to learn
But it's the nature of living
To count only the years left in your heart

She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She didn't want to conquer you
Another misconception
It tasted strange
She can't explain
But it's all forgotten now
Her fingerprints
Are on your hands
That's all she's left for you
You just untangled all her words
They're inexpensive now
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
You walked the world
It's almost over now
Your satellite escape each day
You've got an alpha female muse
A little introspection
She isn't there to be misused
The shallowest reflection
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost
She's lost
Words mean nothing
She's lost

I am the master of this realm
The land will obey my every command
This the future, you cannot deny us any longer
We are the future
We are the future
We are the future

Strike it up, strike it up, strike it up
Strike it up, strike it up, strike it up

If I have the line and you have the bass
Then strike it up and you'll find the rhythm's on time
Line after line going straight to your mind

Moving your waist to the bass is no doubt
Roll up the groove, melody is essential
Drop the knowledge on this instrumental
Cast your doubts about house music

Naturally swinging your thing to the song

Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings

Strike it up, you know how lovely one can be
If I have the line and you have the bass
Then strike it up and you'll find the rhythm's on time
Line after line going straight to your mind

Moving your waist to the bass is no doubt

Been building glass houses when it's raining stones
There's crap on your doorstep, now you're all on your own
You gave it no quarter, now you're treading water
Bartender rang time, it's too late for last orders
You're making a meal out of keeping it real
Sold your soul to the man, it's all part of the deal
Your rhymes were incredible, your marker indelible
So full of yourself you think your shit is edible
Bow, wow, wow, wow, wow
Bow, wow, wow, wow, wow
Getting high, getting high
Getting high on your own
On your own supply
Because in the end you are all on your own
It's what's in your heart and not what you own
You can't see where you're going, you slip, now it's snowing
It won't be too long before the rhymes they stop flowing
Reality bites as they switch off the lights
It's a long way to fall from the dizzying heights
You cut through the pretension too late for redemption
It's the end of the line, now pay close attention
Bow, wow, wow, wow, wow
Getting high, getting high
On your own, on your own
Now it's got to the point where you just can't connect
You've lost all control, you've lost all respect
The mixers are mixing it, the fixers are fixing it
Over inflated there's no restricting it
You're no Captain Scarlet, you're not indestructible
Just who's in your pocket? And who is corruptible?
You speak the unspoken, your will has been broken
Your own self-delusion, your gestures are token
Getting high, getting high
Getting high on your own
On your own supply
Getting high, getting high
Getting high on your own
On your own

Kill the lights
Hello ladies and gentlemen
I'm glad you've graced me with your presence
You're in time to see me wrestle with my conscience
Staring into the si-si-silence
You see I came to save the stage
I hope I'm not too late
Passion called from back
Behind the curtain screaming
"Sonny, this is urgent
Fill these 50 voices with a purpose
But don't just give it away
Inspiration isn't cheap these days
You better make them earn it"
You better
Make them earn it
Make them earn it
You better
Make them earn it
Make them earn it
Hello ladies and gentlemen
I'm glad you've graced me with your presence
You're in time to see me wrestle with my conscience
Staring in the si-si-silence
You see I came to save the stage
I hope I'm not too late
Passion called from back behind the curtain screaming
"Sonny, this is urgent"
You see I came to save the stage
I hope I'm not too late
Passion called from back behind the curtain screaming
"Sonny, this is urgent"
How do I address a letter to my generation?
"Sonny", she said, "Save yourself the postage"
How do I address a letter to my generation?
"Sonny", she said, "Sing it in person"

A troubled mind in search
Of a bright neon bay
I swim to shore
The only route to take
Is perfection itself
The stars lead the way
As waves make oceans complete
Fate is the shell of my beat
O how I feel all that I need
Under my thoughts under my fears
Little things I know they?re real
They make my soul complete
Little things and all they bring
Are fragments bitter sweet
Little things not everything
'Cause glitter is no goal
Simple things are all I need
a friend to guide to hold
If you should go
(Go now)
I find myself alone
With no center no home
But I won?t close my eyes
The thing I love the most
I'm letting you go
But I won?t give up hope

It doesn't have to be this complicated
Or is it just me?
I cherish you it's true
And this love, I value
If it's not meant to be
I'll bow to destiny
And settle for friends
Looking to the left, turning to the right
My life is full of no regrets
I'll settle, I'll settle for friends
[Chorus]
Friends, I'll settle for friends
All I want, is to be your friend
Friends, we can be friends
All I want, is to be your friend
You tell me you're not ready
But I'm precious
You don't want to start something
You can't finish
Sometimes we're blinded by desire
What you want, not what you need
Then it's too late
To make ends meet
[Chorus]
Your friend, your friend (repeat)

When you move, you rock me
When you move, you get me something
When you move, you rock me
When you move, you get me something
When you move, you rock me
When you move, you get me something
Some just move are ain't down
When you move, you rock me.

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
Somewhere in this darkness there's a life that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away or maybe I'm just blind, maybe I'm just blind
So, hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So, hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared but you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone, love me when I'm gone
When your education X-ray cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends
Now roaming through this darkness I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone
So, hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
Ill never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So, hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
(Maybe I'm just blind)
So, hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So, hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone, love me when I'm gone
Woa love me when I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

Another sock in the belly day
Why don't you go away?
Inside your storm
It kinda keeps me warm
At night well, I know it to be true
Swirling through inside you
Your light is my light
Your light
After you left I couldn't sleep
I have nowhere to be now
And if you go then I go too
And if you leave then I will find you
I was kicked in the belly today
And it wasn't fair play
I would scream
But I've too much to say
Life isn't fair play

A stranger walks swiftly thorugh the moonlight
Still in a criminal mind
Stopping for no one and nothing on the way,
Only to fall asleep
A broken man follows his lover
Been hungry for miles and miles
Fire burns bright, and consumes her soul
Feet of her lover born to run

I know that I could not survive
All alone in isolation
I got to get to my body heat
From the many people I know
I got to have a steady flow
Of voices and pretty faces
I stay in crowd places
'Cause I need the body heat
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Save me from the blizzard
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Save me from the cold
All I want is your body heat
To keep me from freezing
You can make me warm inside
If you give me your body heat
Something scares me every time
I'm alone in seclusion
I don't have no body heat
When I'm all by myself
I got to have a place to go
To get some embraces
And the speaker cranked up
Because I need my body heat
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Make me a fire
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Oh, save me now
All I want is your body heat
To keep me from freezing
You can make me warm inside
If you give me your body heat
You can make me warm inside
If you give me your body heat
Gimme, gimmbe body heat
Make me a fire
All I want is body heat
Save me from the cold
Gimme, gimme body heat
Make me, make me a fire
All I want is body heat
Save me from the cold, oh
Gimme, gimme body heat
Make me a fire

Waiting for the dawn
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the dawn
Waiting for the night
The day's too long
The day's too bright
The day's too long
The day's too bright
Love me,
love me to the end
this man pursues
a dagger in his hands
this man pursues
a dagger in his hands
Yet he will never
get into our land
Yet he will never
get into our land
Love me,
love me to the end
Fall down by my side
down in my arms
fall down by my side
down in my arms
this night forever
no morning will come
this night forever
no morning will come
Love me,
love me to the end
Love me,
love me to the end
Love me, love me....

Now that the show is over
and we have jointly exercised our constitutional rights
We would like to leave you with one very important thought
Sometime in the future
you may have the opportunity to serve as a juror
in a so-called obscenity case
It would be wise to remember that the same people
Who would stop you from viewing an adult film
May be back next year to complain about a book or even a TV program
If you can be told what you can see or read
Then it follows that you can be told what to say or think
Defend your constitutionally protected rights
No one else will do it for you
Thank you

Are feelings cast in stone
Or can you navigate a desperate road
Is change a choice for everyone
Or are we destined when we're born
I know you've waited so long
Though you've waited so long
I know you've waited so long, so long
So long
And now you have the sun, the moon
Helps you blossom, makes you bloom
You can't deny
That all our fading hopes and dreams
Light up like Christmas trees
Well ask me how I know
Ask me how I know
I feel like I'm alive
I can't lose
On a scale, on a scale, on a scale
It only proves
The sun, the sun, the sun
Gets in my eyes, my eyes
I saw the sun through the dark and the grey
Even the sun in the light of the day
Never it turns, never turns my way
I, I, I, I, I, I'm not breaking
Somewhere with love in a space I have known
In a massive city of stone
Even though, even though I'm not breaking
I'm not breaking
Truth as we see it
Our strengths to the limit
And everyone's coming over
Treat me like no other
You treat me like no other
No Other
No Other
No Other
Deeper down
Deep Below
How happy
How many hopes
How many blows
How many highs
How many lows
How many dreams
No I will, I will, I will, I will
I'm the light below you
I'm the light below you
I'm the light below you
Below you
So don't look down
Don't look down
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Even the sun in the light of the day
Never it turns, never turns my way
I, I, I, I, I, I'm not breaking
Somewhere with love in a space I have known
In a massive city of stone
Even though, even though I'm not breaking
I'm not breaking
I'm feeling the sun in the light of the day
It's simmering heat gonna lead my way
I, I, I, I, I, I'm not breaking
Somewhere there's love in a place I have known
I gotta get back, yeah I may be alone
Even though, Even though, I'm not breaking
I'm not breaking
I'm not breaking
How much truth can you handle
Hot smells like candles
Heart failed
And everyone's coming over
Everyone's coming over
Everyone's coming over
Everyone's coming over

Why Lucy, your eyes are filled with tears?
My heart is filled with gladness
Oh look, the orchestra's getting ready
Dance with me, George
Check the scene outside of Medellin
Make a fuss in Caracas
Big cigars in dark Havana bars
Mambo slow Guantanamo
Was so glad escape in Trinidad
Upside down in Kingston town
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota
Space cake break at the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Asked for a dance in a dive in Port-au-Prince
Went too far in Bogota
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
A little weak, a little pale today
Rip 'em up
Space cake break on the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today

[Chorus]
Tell me your stories, write down your secrets,
And play this music as loud as can be.
Get me a sandwich, buy me some hot tea,
And sing this song as loud as can be.
Teach me poker, dance with me slowly.
And play this music as loud as can be.
Open the window, draw down the curtains
And sing this song as loud as can be.
I live all deadly like a cartoon
Maybe I can see myself in you
Yes, I want to see myself in you.
Oh it is all great
No it's not.
Yes, it is all great.
It happens to everyone.
If you think about it, it starts out at a younger age.
[Chorus]
Jumping in the pool, swimming in the cold
I ain't gonna swim at the speed of sound
I ain't gonna climb the walls, no no.
It would take more than a day to change.
It would take more than a thousand pens and papers
to let go, to grow, so much crap.
Tell me a story, write down a secret,
Buy me a sandwich, get me some hot tea,
Speak in your language, turn off the t.v.,
Make me a drawing, cut me some radish
Send me a postcard, write me a letter
And sing this song as loud as he can be
I'm a black eyed raccoon working from the moon
I look back and all I did was blank
Not there never there
It was all dream of gray fantasy
To much hope tricking me
Draw the smiles on my face
Draw your face on my face
I miss you
[Chorus]
[Repeat: x2]
And sing this song as loud as can be

Certainly someone who is frozen is not alive, but neither are they dead
They are in a third state a biostasis what I would use to describe ... liquid cool
Make me immortal yeah yeah
I am immortal yeah
I am nothing yeah yeah
Becoming liquid cool
Waves of oblivion yeah yeah
Lap at my feet yeah
Laugh in my face yeah yeah
Devil take me... liquid cool
I is another yeah
We blackout together yeah
Our little death, yeah yeah
Twilight elixir... liquid cool
Make me immortal yeah yeah
Once more around the sun
über religion yeah yeah
Ultra-evolution... liquid cool
He who lives these words
Shall not taste death
Becoming nothing yeah yeah
Forever liquid cool
The number seventy-two living in another lifetime, the number seventy-two ? future ones
To get into some place in the future where nobody?s ever beautiful
But some day we?ll look back and wonder how we ever tolerated it, life and death.

The spark in your eyes
Tell me you sure.
Though it comes in no surprise
It was never there before
If this was a game
would you fight for a prize?
Suddenly swain
Under Indigo light
What took us so long
to realise
It's not our sun
It's just summer skies
If this was a game
would you fight for a prize?
Suddenly swain
Under Indigo light
What took us so long
to realise?
It's not our sun
It's just summer skies
What took us so long
to realise?
It's not our sun
It's just summer skies

All the boys hangin' out down in the parking lot
The night riders giving all they've got
While the girls look so good at looking bad
Out strutting dressed in the latest fad
Valentino looks for something new
Escapes for the night and waits his cue
And I love the way they make their move
Yes, I love the way they're makin' moves
Kids clothe armor hands like battle dress
Got his act down, some kind of feelings
And tonight they're gonna make the run
Downtown, call the garrison
From the back roads, through the alleys it screams
You gotta get a feeling mean, mean, mean
And I love the way they make their move
Yes, I love the way they're makin' moves
Rockface going nowhere fast
Some gonna make it, some don't even last
Just one night, they don't give a damn
I'm the star, hides another sham
There's no silver and there's no gold
It's just that one shot before they're old
And I love the way they make their moves
Yes, I love the way they're makin' moves
Ooh, I love, I just love the way they're makin' moves
Makin' moves, makin' moves

Chic
Chic
Everybody strut
Chic
Chic
Everybody strut
Come on everybody
Give me a C C
Give me an H H
Give me an I I
Give me a C C
If your friends are chic
Consider yourself unique
Just one favour we ask
We hope it's not too hard a task
If you don't mind, would you please
Get up off of your seat and repeat
Chic

Armored cars sail the sky
They're pink at dawn
If I lived forever you just wouldn't be so beautiful
As the sun
When it shines
All over the world
We're pilots watching the stars
The world pre-occupied
We're pilots watching the stars
Who do you think we are?
Ice and clouds
Shimmer outside
Rain just falls
At magic hour
It's just the sound
Of you and me
Time twitching
Murmurs of our friendly machine

I lay down beside him
He gives me kisses
Follow the tracks
From another dream
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow the tracks
And spin
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
Into the open
I lay amongst the clouds
Dissolving falling down
Follow the tracks
I promise to send word
I enter the visible world
With a tongue of secrets
I breathe the neon
With a calm, calm, calm, calm fear.
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I breathe the neon
With a calm fear
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I Breath the neon
With a calm fear
I Breath the neon
With a calm fear
I Breath the neon
With a calm fear

Get up, we are eternal funk.
Alias, the phemaldehyde funkmen
You can't see us, but you can feel us
Get up on the funk funk, funk funk, funk funk
Feel it begin to rock rock, rock rock, rock rock
If you're tired of the same o' sound, get up on the Molly funk sound!
'Cause we are living funk funk, funk funk, funk funk
"c'mon, dig the funky horns"
"It is our will to let you know that we exist, so don't resist,
Let it all hang out. Huh, don't be a dead boogie, baby!"
Ya dig my heavy drift, ya dig my heavy drift,
My drift's too hip to resist, my drift's too hip to resist
To get off on is a trip, to get off on is a trip, funk funk
If you can do with me I can do with you, just like 2 supposed to do. Hey, hey,
Shepdopopdobelieaaaaay!
This sure ain't gonna be funk, it's gettin' down on the sea thunk
'Cause we are living funk funk, funk funk, funk funk! Hey!
We can be funky as we want to be and can be funkier than that!
We were here before you felt the funk.
And we will be hear after the funky feelin's gone!
I'm stretchin' out on the floor! I'm stretchin' out on the floor
It feels too good to ignore It feels too good to ignore
Sweats all over my face, baby, sweats all over my face
It's a crazy place!
I'm breakin' out on the floor again, baby, da-nah nah na-nah na
It feels too good to ignore, da-nah nah na-nah na
Sweats all over my face, da-nah nah na-nah na
Funk funk, it's a crazy place!

Long ago, for many years
White men came in the name of God
They took their land, they took their lives
A new age has just begun
They lost their Gods, they lost their smile
They cried for help for the last time
Liberty was turning into chains
But all the white men said
"That's the cross of changes"
In the name of God, in the name of God
The fight for gold these were the changes
Tell me is it right, in the name of God
These kind of changes?
They tried to fight for liberty
Without a chance in hell, they gave up
White men won in the name of God
With the cross as alibi
There's no God who ever tried
To change the world in this way
For the ones who abuse His name
There'll be no chance to escape
On judgment day
In the name of God, in the name of God
The fight for gold these were the changes
Tell me is it right, in the name of God
These kind of changes?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell why
The white men said
"That's the cross of changes?"
Tell me why, tell me why, tell why
In the name of God
These kind of changes

[Maxi Jazz]
We're floating from right to bright news [Repeat: x 3]
Making sips of your pop skin
All I need to know it
What more I have to do
All I need to know it
What more I have to do
[Low voice]
What do you want?

You tore my skin
But I didn't bleed
Tried to steal my thoughts
From in my sleep
Its through, not blue
Its through, not blue
You tore me down
But I'm standing tall,
From over here
You look completely small
Its through not blue
Its through not blue
But now you're bleeding faster,
Bleeding faster.....

You can close your eyes it's over now
It's over now
You can close your eyes it's over
Baby baby baby
Make a wish
Tell me have you ever been afraid like this
(It's over now)
I've seen it watching me
That misty thing
Without a face
It weaves my thoughts
Lined them up in black lace
It buries my shape
And leaves no trace
Tomorrow I will have no shame
And I will start again
Make a wish
Tell me have you ever felt alone like this
(over now)
Better do it sure
Just wishing
I could move in some more
Tomorrow I will have no shame
And I will start again
Make a wish
You can close your eyes it's over now
Baby I have never been afraid like this
You can close your eyes it's over now
(Make a wish)
(Make a wish)
I took off my shoes
I took off my face
And then I undid the buttons on my dress
(I will start again)
Make a wish
You can close your eyes it's over now
Tell me have you ever been exposed like this
(You can ???)
Baby baby baby
Feels like a kiss
(You can close your eyes and start again)
I bet you never thought that I could feel like this
Tomorrow I will have no shame
Tomorrow I will have no shame
(Make a wish)

Everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
Everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
When it comes, it falls in pieces.
Eating holes and gems unbound.
Birds and hearts and flags and everything.
Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
Money matters. Does mercy matter?
Suddenly, as things are clearer,
See the sights are getting nearer.
Said, everything. Devoured.

Ooh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And ooh, I lost the feeling but I'm tryin'a hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore!
When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been laying on the floor, sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life, I'd know how!
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up to the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
Ooh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared,
Visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words 'til I can't make a sound
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
Can't hold back, reaching out
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it to you, give it to you!
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

Doing me in jigging under
Your part of destination
And it's time to go
To the sleep and driving slow
Your destination
And it's time to feel
To hit it one's for real
Your destination
There's no turning back
The world is come to attack
Your destination
Your destination

I see right through to you
See right through to you
See right through to you
I see right through to you
It's not like I don't feel your mood
What you have for me is different
Then the rest that moves
I'll be positive I know that I could be there to
'Cause you have it all, have it all
I see right through to you
See your every move
See right through to you
See your every move
I know you now
I reach your mind
You've shown some how
What I could find
On the inside
There you will see
We're all alike you and me

Riding on my bicycle I saw a motorcrash,
A proper motorcrash and lots of spectators.
I rushed to the centre saw the injured parents,
Cuts on the children,
An awful motorcrash.
Dangerous terribly bloody motorcrash,
Destructive motorcrash.
Took the mother,
Sneaked with her secretly all the way to my home,
And nursed her gently put on her bandages,
Gave her milk and biscuits,
She sighed pleasantly after this awful motorcrash.
That girl on that bicycle showed great interest in
All the motorcrashes in the neighbourhood,
She look quite innocent,
But believe you me I know what innocence looks like and it wasn't there,
After she got that bicycle.
Then we disguised ourselves,
Took a taxi to her home,
When her husband opened the door she introduced her-self,
He said "where have you been all this time? "

I've given up again, maybe I'm just tired
Of thinking that there's one way, only one way out
I was hoping by now, that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down
Even though I'm not over it yet
I can put forever in the plans that you have
Stupid and low with the odds that you bet
I can put forever in the plans that you have
Take my life and start it somewhere else
I breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again
I wanna take it back, everything we had
The curse of love has had me and it turned my heart bad
With a will there's a way, definite, you say
I'm looking out to the water, I'm singing my heart out
Even though I'm not really over it yet
I can see forever in the plans that you had
Stupid low with odds that had you bet
I can see forever in the plans that you had
I've given up again, maybe I'm just tired
Of thinking that there was one way, only one way out
I was hoping by now, that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down
Take my life and start it somewhere else
I breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again
It's time to take it back, everything we had
The curse of love is healthy if it gives your heart back
With a will there's a way, to definite, you say
I'm running out to the water, I'm singing my heart out
Take my life and start it somewhere else
I breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again
I've given up again, maybe I'm just tired
Of thinking that there's one way, only one way out
I was hoping by now, that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down
(I'm singing my heart out)
The only way is up again
(I'm singing my heart out)

Do it!, just do it!
exploit yourself just sellout, cash cards, just sellout
Do it to yourself before its done to you
It's the euro, dollar, the yen or rubal
Sellout is the aim
On the billboard, in the adverts, this is the big game
Exploit, sellout, poser sellout,
Cos were up for sale
This is steep not cheap and get in now
Before it all goes stale

Jet set in poverty

Cultural jammers, hey'all
Paper tiger, this is your call
come with me let's burn down the mall
the world has gotten just so unbelievably commercial, right?
And people are starting to go a little bit crazy from it!
They've completely bought into it
And it's been a hell of a ride
But now they're reaching a saturation point
They think, maybe, they're getting to the end
of this business of glitz and hype and you gotta have it
so we say, in a fact, yeah, your instincts are right
for the first time in forever, marketing isn't cool
eccess isn't cool....
we do a trend piece, not a think piece
but more of a package for four or five spreads
we built a package around these people
we turned them into stars
exploit yourself just sellout, cash and cards, just sellout
Do it to yourself before its done to you
For the cash

It`s later than I thought it was
The shadows long and lost

My alphabet angels come out to play
Yeah

There's a Belfast girl I loved and lost
On the rolling hills around my home
Now she stays home nights behind locked doors
Since a plastic bullet stopped him
And he don't come no more
There's a Belfast boy was loved and lost
On the crowded streets of his own home town
Pepper my heart with a lover's words
And I'll pepper yours with a Gatlin gun
Mother my heart is full of lead
And it weighs me down and I just can't cry
Remember me to schoolboy friends
And tell it as it was, please try
So come by my boy and sit you down
There's a tale to hear, a tale to tell this town
You say the devil will get me some day
You can tell him I'm waiting
Cause these are the things I must say
Mother my heart is full of lead
And life holds few surprises too
Tell that to the little ones
Before they learn to laugh at you
Mother my heart is full of lead
And it weighs me down and I just can't cry
Remember me to schoolboy friends
And tell it as it was, please try

I grew up on the edge of a cornfield at the end of a long dirt road
Carolina plow boy, ain't had a free summer since I was ten years old
Mama made us pick our own switches so we could feel the sting of doing wrong
That set me straight on the road I'm still on
I am who I am
The product of a good woman loved by a real good man
I've learned what I've learned
By finding the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me
I grew up on gospel cause that's all my daddy'd listen to
I found my soul in rock and roll when me and my first guitar were introduced
Truth is I've only loved one woman
And she'd have stayed, but I made her leave
She's still hauntin' me in every song I sing
I am who I am
The product of a woman still loved by a stubborn man
I've learned what I've learned
By finding the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me
Like me or leave me
Either way you know it the second you shake my hand
I'm a long way from Jesus, but I know He knows I'm doing the best I can
I am who I am
The product of the good Lord lovin' a sinful man
I've learned what I've learned
By finding the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me

You blew it if you try, little sister
You're blowin' it sky high, little sister
You killed your brother when you blew his brain
You're high on money and your lover's pain
An' kiss your mommy with your life again, oh-oh
Oh was it a good time?
Oh was it a good time?
Oh was it a good time?
Oh was it a good time?
Good time
Good time
Good time

Oh my god it's so hot
Oh my got it's so gold
Oh my god I'm so messed up

Stars above try to guess
Where's my gin, where's my glass?
All this mess comes from your ass
Fuck with us we are CSS

We didn't come into the world
To walk around
We came here to take you out
Come with us, we'll make a toast

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Feel the love generation,
Ooohhh yeah-yeah,
Why must our children play in the streets,
Broken hearts and faded dreams,
Peace and love to everyone that you meet,
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet,
Just look to the rainbow, you will see,
Sun will shine 'till eternity,
I've got so much love in my heart,
No one can tear it apart,
Yeah.
(whistleing)

Come on! go!
Too dead for me... too dead for - too dead for me!
[Repeat: x2]
What do you say?
Too dead for me!
What do you say?
Too dead for - too dead for -
Too dead - what do you sell your soul for?
Too dead for - too dead for - 1, 2, 3, 4!
Too dead for me! too dead for -
It's just too dead for me!
Too dead for - too dead for -
What do you sell your damn soul for?
It's just too dead for me...
We won't keep quiet! we won't keep quiet!
We won't keep quiet! we won't keep quiet!
Never!
Fast like a blizzard - cold like stone
Luxury depression crushed your bones
This kinda think is too sad for me... go! go ! go! go!
You cry later - dope calculator
Nothing else but an empty prayer!
The safe side didn't work out? that's too bad for you...
What do you say?
We won't calm down! we won't calm down! we won
[Repeat: x3]
Too dead for - too dead for
Too dead for me!
There's nothing going on for you?
Just look around you!
No! no! no! that's too dead for me!
Like a toy without belief -
Like a sead for a fascist society
You! you are too dead for me!
That's too dead for me... I don't want to listen...
It would destroy the last dreams I've left for you...
[Repeat: x8]
Too dead for - too dead for - (x8)
[Repeat: x5]
Too dead for me!
I run around to see my soul smashed into pieces
Like a hole in my chest and it burns and it burns
It never stops!
They can't wait to waste my youth
Consumed like a corporation's entity
And then it stops! it just stops!
Come on!
Watch out! watch out!
Fools around me through the back door
Backbite! and we define what's hardcore!
And that's what I am! that's where I go!
I never understood what you sold your soul for...
[Repeat: x10]
Too dead for - too dead for
[Repeat: x7]
Too dead for me!
What do you say?
[Repeat: x3]
Too dead for - too dead for
What do you say?
Too dead for me...
What do you say?

There is no contemplating,
Its all negotiating,
It makes no sense what weve become,
There are no words to explain,
Its all just birds and aeroplanes,
We stretch but we cant even touch.
They talk about our present,
The past and almost everything,
Before they never even tried,
But I cant find the answers,
To all the questions inside,
Some things just are the way they are.
Yeah but tonight its all,
An ever lasting out of here,
The kind that makes my story disappear,
Tonight its everything Ill ever need to know,
I am searching for the right way to go.
Ive tried to see it your way,
Ive made up stupid stuff to say,
But you never really did reply,
There are tons of bricks between us,
But we still have to meet up,
And be the people that we are.
They talk about our present,
The past and almost everything,
Before they never even tried,
But I cant find the answers,
To all the questions inside,
Some things just are the way they are.
Yeah but tonight its all,
An ever lasting out of here,
The kind that makes my story disappear,
Tonight its everything Ill ever need to know,
I am searching for the right way to go. (3x)
They talk about our present,
Before they never even tried,
But I cant find the answers,
But I cant find the answers

Don't let the routine kill our life
Do you still want to be by my side
Remember the time we were both right
Like on the photos that you hide
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Just be an easy going woman
Alright
Easy going woman
I tried so hard to please you
That i forgot my own happiness - happiness
Don't play that game like you used to do
Do you believe what you say - what you say
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Just be an easy going woman
Alright
Easy going woman
I still believe that people can change
Please let me know if you want me to
How many years do we have to wait
For understanding each other - each other
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Just be an easy going woman
Alright
Easy going woman
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Just be an easy going woman
Alright
Easy going woman

(Latin Chant "O Fortuna velut Luna")
Turn around and smell what you don't see
Close your eyes ... it's so clear
Here's the mirror, behind there is a screen
And with wings you can get in
Don't think twice before you listen to your heart
Follow the trace of a random star
What you need and everything you feel
Is just the question of the day
In the eye of storm
You'll see a lonely dove
The experience of survival is the key
To the gravity of love
(woman)
The path of excess leads to
The tower of Wisdom
(man)
The path of excess leads to
The tower of Wisdom
Try to think about it ...
That's the chance to live your life and discover
What is it, what's the gravity of love
Look around just people,
Can you hear their voice?
Find the one who'll guide you
To the limits of your choice
But if you're in the eye of storm
Just think of the lonely dove
The experience of survival is the key
To the gravity of love.

Two wishes, a lifetime
A sad and real man
And hoping for money
A higher grade
The beggars are waiting
They've got enough time
Time that you are missing
But don't shout it out:
Taxi driver telling you
Nasty things you'll never do
And the thief is watching still
With that sinful tiny king
My adored beloved one
Give me kisses burning sun
Meet me later at the bar
And the devil's dancer's car
Sit down, wait and enter hell
Share the laughter, put a spell
On the ones that smile too much
And walk upstairs and touch the sky
And drink my tears and dance tonight
Betray betray betray betray
Marching down the hill
Overpaid overpaid overpaid overpaid
Will you pay the bill
Money is a friend of mine
And I will never thrill
Overpaid overpaid let me pay the bill
Influence my will
Masterpieces are for sale
Naked bodies ring the bell
Mister goodtimes knows for sure
Any splendid new encore
Enter now his secret room
Walk around and sip teardrops
Lay down by the golden side
And make love 'til morning light
Enjoy the laughter, put a spell
On the ones that talk too much
At the top climax countdown
And run downstairs
And touch the ground
And eat my sins
And dance tonight
Betray betray ...

Time to take another walk
And vanish without trace
Under the surface
Finding my own space
No one really knows
The hidden sight of time
Behind the one way mirror
Of the closed mind
Looking so far
The things we cannot see
Inside I've lost a part in me
Lost a part in me
And as I disappear from the face of the earth
Straight in to the ground
And as I disappear from the face of the earth
No one else around
Looking so far
The things we cannot see
Inside I've lost a part in me
Lost a part in me
And as I disappear from the face of the earth
Straight in to the ground
And as I disappear from the face of the earth
No one else around

Get down get get get down
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
Get down
The bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Up from the roof - 100% proved
B.O.Dubb - giving it nuff
Push and a shove - burning hot
You're brain starts to rattle and you're nerves get shocked
You get scared but it's just the take off
It's all funky like the odor in you're underarm
Loosen up 'cause' we're about to make your head nod
And all you freaks grab a hold of your nuts
Here we come the one's on the run
Came back for more 'cause' we just ain't done
It's the funk addictive like skunk
Gotta have some and put the rest to the trunk
We deliver the brand new formula
It won't be long till' everybody wants a
Piece of this you ask what it is
It's the way of the flow that throws away you missories
Yep yep with yep and a yep yep
You don't stop 'cause' we come with a kingstep
So make a room, make a room, make a room now
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
Get down
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Straight ahead - levels onna red
You want action well that's what you get
It's a effect of direct approach that you cope even if ya ruffneck
The ingredients - hard funk dividends
Make you move even if you don't wanna dance
We bring the heat and cut you up open
There'll be no pretending I'll leave the mic smoking
Operation bigger than the bang-
The freestyler nigga with an other dope jam
You go damn - taught we couldn't hang.
Now here's how it goes I make you understand
These lyrics combined with spirit
Spread all around all the major cities
You can't avoid the new sound boy
It's right here like the real mc coy
Yep yep with yep and a yep yep
You don't stop 'cause' we come with a kingstep
So make a room, make a room, make a room now
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
Get down
We renovate you're whole mind state
Our boogie is the bomb sure to stimulate
But be cautious take small doses
We don't want you to hyperventilate
The speakers kick the riddim and the riff
Right on point - no question if
You feel the shakes - transform aches
Ain't nothing wrong the whole place vibrates
Yep yep with yep and a yep yep
You don't stop 'cause' we come with a kingstep
So make a room, make a room, make a room now
'cause' the bomb and the funk is about to get down

Devine, fantasy, like a dream, never ends.
Fairytales are in my head
And in my head they start
To tell you bout the deepest thoughts
That lives in side my heart
Fairytales are in my head
And in my head they start
To tell you bout the deepest thoughts
That lives in side my heart
Devine, fantasy, like a dream, never ends.
Fairytales are in my head
And in my head they start
To tell you bout the deepest thoughts
That lives in side my heart
Fairytales are in my head
And in my head they start
To tell you bout the deepest thoughts
That lives in side my heart

I can see she's in for this
She can't see her
It can make her happy
And I can see
She's says she's gone forward
And she's crying
And see she's calling
Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And it's the first thing that I would do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house
They say that I'm lonely
That I hide away
That I hide away from all of you
And I can't see
She's says she doesn't follow
She need an answer
And see she's falling
Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And it's the first thing that I would do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And don't tell me what I should do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house
And she can call my number
The way she feels like home
And I'll come and catch her
When she feels she's gone
And yeah we're both alone now
And yet we're not forever
The thing that makes us lonely
Will bring us back together
Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And that's the last thing that I would do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house

Slowly runs the lazy river
And in it I pitched all my dreams
And all the things I ever wanted
And watched them heading slowly downstream
For I have learned that such things fade
Like photographs and family holidays
And every Monday is Goodbye Sunday
I guess you'd like me to throw away
That box of diaries and old letters
For they do nothing
But feed my memory
But really you should know me better
For I am too fond of the past
But I think I am learning at last
That every Monday is Goodbye Sunday
Yes it's true that I cling to things
That I should leave behind
As if those were the goldens days
Well, I just hope that you really don't mind
Slowly runs the lazy river
Every Monday is Goodbye Sunday etc etc

Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve (ah ah)
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve (ah ah)
I put my ear on your chest
To hear the message that your body sends me back
I'm going to eat all your food
To try to feel what is that that music is to you
Kiss you in the photo booth
Duct tape you in my roof
Look at it know it's true
Look at it know it's true
Duct tape you in my roof
Kiss you in the photo booth
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve (ah ah)
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve
Believe, achieve (ah ah)
I'm going to wear your shoes today
Walk around the block hear what your neighbors have to say
And then read all your books
To know what you were thinking when your body didn't move
Kiss you in the photo booth
Duct tape you in my roof
Look at it know it's true
Look at it know it's true
Duct tape you in my roof
Kiss you in the photo booth
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
Share with me your moments of glory
Tell me tell me tell, your sad sad stories
Where did you sit in the classrooms
How did you behave as a teen in high school
I'm gonna take your eyes, use them as a sea
Curl up in a tree on my balcony
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true
I believe that love was created just for me and you
People say it's not but I know that it's true

Baby
Hey
La doo doo doo doo
Step into my secret world
Tonight I'm going to be your private angel
I just want to be your girl
Love you all night
Love you all night
Slip into a heated bath
The scent of cherry blossoms fills the air
As I rub your body down
You can just relax and let me work it
1 - I'll show you how
I break it down
Candles, Chardonnay, & flowers
I'll tend the lights
Warm the bed
Preparing for the hour (when the shades go down)
2 - We can bath in my red light
Getting naughty through the night (naughty)
Sharing love and all love sounds
When the shades go down
When the shades go down
In the comfort of my bed (in the comfort of my bed)
Silk, satin and jade
Exotic pleasures can be found
When the shades go down
When the shades go down
Somethin's on the menu tonight
I know you're going to like it from the first bite
Tell me what's your appetite
Do you like it raw
Do you like it raw
Kisses, there so warm on the skin
Come and taste the sweetness that's within
Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Steam on my window
Reflections of red light
(You and I through the night)
To simple it seemed that night
(Impressions from my fingers)
And my fingertips leave impressions
Of the love's intensity
See the pleasures of love
In the lowest tattoos
Like a joyous slick
I'm waiting for you
Dive into my waters
And ride the waves
Everytime the love is made
See the pleasures of love
In the lowest tattoos
Like a joyous slick
I'm waiting for you
Dive into my waters
And ride the waves
It's time to pull down the shades
Repeat 2
Umm, go down, go down, go down (naughty)
Go down, go down, go down
(When the shades go down) (go down, baby)
Go down, go down, go down
(My shades - yeah) (go down, baby)
Go down, go down, go down (go down baby)
When the shades go down

I could be persuaded,
To give my heart to you.
If you promised not to break it,
Cause that's so easy to do.
You could be the answer,
To every prayer I've prayed.
So keep on doing what you do,
Cause I could be persuaded.
If just one kiss makes me feel like this,
I know there's a chance we could make it.
If you want this dance, offer me your hand
Chances are good that I'll take it.
Cause I could be persuaded,
To give my life to you.
I know it's crazy, baby, we were meant to be,
And I could be persuaded.
Keep on doing what you doing,
Cause I could be persuaded.
I could be persuaded, yeah, yeah.
I could be persuaded.

I search alone on empty glasses
The lights come on illuminating
A nowhere bar that's like a Tardis
It's the longest night
I've ever known
Too much, too little
Too late to wanna dance
Too much, too little
Too late tonight
I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know
No damaged goods can be refunded
On broken hearts I can't rely
I found a diamond that shines brightly
I can't let that go
Don't pass me by
Too much, too little
Too late to wanna dance
Too much, too little
Too late tonight
I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know

I don't know, what went wrong
If I did, would it matter cause
It just wasn't enough
You know when the moment comes
To be strong, show resistance
And that's what
We're led to believe
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
And when it all seems to fall apart
You can't breathe
You don't know what you're thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
Yes when things didn't work out
It will soon disappear and will be miles away
Away from here
You don't mind if life's not that pretty
It will soon disappear and be miles away
Away from here
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
And when it all seems to fall apart
You can't breathe
You don't know what you're thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
Oh oh oh oh oh
I will be here, I will be here
Oh oh oh oh oh
I will be here, I will be here
You know when the moment comes
To be strong, show resistance
And that's what
Will lead you to believe
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
And when it all seems to fall apart
You can't breathe
You don't know what you're thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here, I will be here

Couldn't leave you if I tried
Couldn't weather this alone
And through the darkness you still provide
The sweetest love I've ever known
Take the shadow from the road I walk upon
Be my sunshine, sunshine
And in the emptiness
You look and find someone
The damage is undone
And love has made you strong
And heaven gave me mine, thalheim
The saddest words have come undone
Changing the very air I breathe
And miracles have just begun
In which only you and I believe
Take the shadow from the road I walk upon
Be my sunshine, sunshine
And in the weightlessness
You look and find someone
The damage is undone
And love has made you strong
Heaven gave me mine, thalheim
When I'm all at sea
You never let me down
I'll just keep coming back to you
'til I walk on solid ground
From the foothills to the mountains
On the waters of the rhine
Face to face in shahbagh gardens
In communion, out of time
Thalheim, thalheim
From the lilies of the valley
To the grapes upon the vine
The well of speculation
Is it his or hers or mine?
Thalheim, thalheim
In the everything and nothing
In disharmony and rhyme
In the sound of shot and echo
Who's the victim, what's the crime?
What's the crime?
Be my, be my sunshine
In the keening cries of evening
Unforgotten, underlined
We slipped into the water
Out of focus, out of time.

Counterfeit, counterfeit
That's what you're, shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And I make her bleed
Liquid blood stain from your finger
Say what do you see?
Remind you that whatever you get is
What you want it to be
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends 'get out the way!' of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance.
Oooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend [Repeat x4]
Coming back coming back
To a place where, I never knew.
Pushing knobs, pushing faders,
But I, don't know what they do.
This reflection in my mirror, reminds me of you.
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view.
You get a feeling, that's what you choose.
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends 'get out the way!' of all the lightning hitting the trees today?
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance.
Oooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

[Repeat: x 8]
We all feel the pain,
Is it necessary,
When we feel the pain,
Better stick together,
Music is the way,
To releave the pressure,
Music "on the way",
Do you get the message.

This temperamental side,
The one you say that you can't hide.
D'you ever see yourself
The way it looks to someone else?
This temperamental trick,
The one you say you can't predict.
You're like an empty cup.
Forgive me if I don't wait up.
I don't get where you're coming from
What is real and what's put on,
What has stayed and what has gone.
How long will this thing go on and on?
I don't want you to love me.
I don't want you to love me.
You're like an empty cup,
But I can't fill you up.
What planet are you on?
Not the same one I am from.
Do I just waste my time?
You pour your heart on mine.
You say it screws you up.
Forgive me if I don't wait up.
I don't get what you're trying to say
What is wrong and what's okay.
You beat yourself up one more time.
You trample on this fierce heart of mine.
I don't want you to love me.
I don't want you to love me.
I don't know what you want from me.
All this endless sympathy.
You beat yourself up one more time.
You trample on this fierce heart of mine.
I don't want you to love me.
I don't want you to love me.

I try to figure out but I don't understand
What makes one man better then another man
I try to figure out if there's something I can do
To change the way u see me and I see u
The color of my skin, unlike the color of my eyes
Is getting me in trouble, costing me a hefty price
I try to stay away from all those sacred clans
I'll try to stay in town, I'll try to make a stand
Heads down, make sure your head's down
Don't get to this town, face down
Face down, make sure u stay down
Don't stay in town, heads down
If u look in to my eyes, u will see the color blue
If I look at u I'll see a human who is living in this town
Like I live every day
Trying to survive, trying to find his way
If u are looking at my skin u see the color black
We better look ahead then look back
We better make this town a better place to live in
Cuz what u are going to get, is what u are giving
Heads down, make sure your head's down
Don't get to this town, face down
Face down, make sure u stay down
Don't stay in town, heads down

You lied
Around me
Me be
It's so cold

She rises early from bed
Runs to the mirror
The bruises inflicted in moments of fury
He kneels beside her once more
Whispers a promise
"Next time I'll break every bone in your body"
And the well-wishers let the devil in
And if the river ran dry they'd deny it happening
As the card players deal their hands
From the bottom of te deck
Row upon row of feudal houses blown away
Medicine for the popular complaint
When the poets dreamed of angels
What did they see?
History lined up in a flash at their backs
When the poets dreamed of angels
What did they see?
The bishops and knights well placed to attack

In a wilderness of foggy thoughts
Battling with your minds retorts
And walking on empty plains
Where deserts so calm
Even drowning rains
Soldier on
To this marching song
Head held high
With eyes fixed strong
Drum beat died
Cymbal crash down
The mud it is thick
With desires to drown
Your feet in earth
Your boots are sinking
Sink with the memories
Of long lost thinking
And armies of many
Are fighting their fight
Lost in the blackness
They're losing their sights
Your veins are my trenches
My gun is my own
The whispers fall heavy
With delicate moans
Arms and legs
Teeth and nail
Our fragile companions
Are destined to fail
For this battalion
Has been run through
Therefore captains and comrades
I bid you all adieu

Back down
And touch
The door is shut
In the end
You're just too close
There's no-one here
There's no-one there
I still can't tell
Try this
And you might find
I'm in your face
I see your face
The air is cold
I'm still on hold
I still can't tell
What's been said

Hey
Stay home
Won't go
You stay home
Hey
Stay home
Won't go
You stay home
Hey
Stay home
Won't go
You stay home

Don't go to bed mad at your lover
You'll wind up pulling the covers from each other
Don't make love without wearing a rubber
They might have slept with another

Just have a good time
Just have a good time
Don't be rushin' when you're pushin' for your lovin'
Take your time when you do the natural thing
So divine to feel the passion in this fashion
Put your brain before your ding-a-ling
Just have a good time
Just have a good time

Just one more thing
Remember the whole world's a circus
Don't you be the clown

Oh Jonathan
Don't be angry Jonathan
Can you lay your hand on my forehead?
Through darkest nights
Can you handle the darkest nights?
At the crack of dawn I am ashamed
Oh sister, oh
Can you forgive me?
Sister old
Can you lay your hand on my forehead?
Oooh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Can you give it, give it, give it, give it, give it?
Oooh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Can you give it, give it, give it, give it, give it?
Seulement la nuit
Et pourquoi seulement la nuit?
Je sais que tu ne répondras pas
Seulement ici

Est-ce qu'ailleurs je ne t'appartiens pas?
C'est interdit
Et pourquoi est-ce interdit?
Je te croyais au-dessus des lois

The coil of the spring
Has tighented too tight
It's awkward and tense
And it no longer fits me
Disappointment and stress
Has drained me away
I can't think anymore
It leaves me lukewarm
The intention was here
Along with a purpose
Then came the worry
(Now I'm all nervous)
I want it complete
But it all falls apart
It's never enough
And it's always too much
I don't want it no more
It left me lukewarm.

All the time
Some people just want to lie on beaches in the Caribbean
All the time
Some people want to do crazy with green amphibians
All the time
Some people want some people to do as they please
All the time
We just want to have a good time
All the time
Some people go ou, they go quoi quoi, they go qui
Some people have nothing, and want nothing, and are free
Some people want to burn the world with their greed
We just want to have a good time
I just want good times
We just want good times
I just want good times
We just want good times
I just want good times
We just want good times
I just want good times
All the time
We just want to have a good time
Tonight
We just want to have a good time all the time
We just want to have a good time
Tonight
We just want to have a good time all the time
Some people want pussy pussy pussy all the while
Some people want nothing only staying home with Mama
Some people want nothing and need nothing and are free
We just want to have a good time
I just want good times
We just want good times
I just want good times
We just want good times
I just want good times
We just want good times
All the time

Just a feeling i have,just a feeling
Just a feeling i have.
Would you love me like that?
And if you love somebody else,
will you still pretend you're mine?
Would you leave me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
Sometimes i lie awake while your are sleeping.
I think of all the things that we've been through.
I can't deny suspicious minds,
seeing things that don't exist.
Would you leave me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
It doesn't feel the same the way you hold me.
Sometimes you turn away when i kiss your lips.
And if you love somebody else,
will you still pretend you're mine.
Would you love me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
Just a feeling i have.
Just a feeling.
Just a feeling i have.
Would you love me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
There are times when words can take new meaning.
And all the sweetest things can sound the same.
And there are thousand ways to say goodbye i haven't heard.
Would you tell me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
Just a feeling i have.
Just a feeling.
Just a feeling i have.
Would you love me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
And if you love somebody else,
will you still pretend you're mine.
Would you leave me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.
Just a feeling i have.
Just a feeling.
Just a feeling i have.
Would you love me like that?
It's just a feeling i have.

Mmh, you're sticking to my finger
Mmh, you smell like used before
Mmh, your skin to me tastes rotten
Let me lick a little more
First time we walked the junkyard you said the magic words,
Love should be decorated with a little bit of dirt
More or less neglected from backbone to the heart,
It was more than I expected and I knew it from the start
That you'd fit into my trash box
Mmh, a perfect place to be
Although I know how much that cash sucks,
I want you there for free

[Verse 1:]
Is it strained, when I call you
Or do you think, that I might forget
Oh your love, is radiating
The farther away
I go
I go
[Verse 2:]
Do you count, on me now
And do you wait, up for me all night
I wish I could run, to you when you need me
You know I can't be far
For long
For long
[Chorus :]
Heart don't fail me now
Cause there is no time to waste
Don't shut me out, we shouldn't wait another day
I've searched for you, on my hearts high speed chase
Hear me out, may be the only chance to say
Hold me now
I've said it Every Other Way
[Bridge :]
These tears I've cried
More moments gone to waste
I've searched for you
I've said it Every Other Way

I'm never relaxed even when I say I am
I'm always on the alert looking for the problem
This isn't my style, I flirt with guys but they don't get me
I think I'm ready to kill the next person who doesn't fit
I am all of these things, I am this and more
It's hell above the water
Hell above the water
Hell above the water
Hell above the water
I'm the one in command, look at the state that I'm in
I really fear for my friends at everything that they have seen
I've got no reason to say a thing, got no reason to say a thing
'Cos you don't scare me at all
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no no
It's hell above the water
Hell above the water
Hell above the water
Hell above the water
Keep your clever mouth shut
I am all of these things, I am this and more
You don't scare me at all, you don't scare me at all
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no no
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no no

Hell above the water
Hell above the water
Hell above the water

Be free from what you are
Be free where you are
Be free from this world
Does she care for me
Be free from what you lie
Be free where you are
Be free and love me more
Oh baby
All I feel is falling
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna feel falling
I wanna, I wanna
All I feel is falling
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna feel falling
I wanna, I wanna
She was fucking weird
Why was she staring at me like that
Why is she staying here
Oh no, copy paste again, I'm always on the run forever
Be free from what you like
Be free where you are
Be free from this world
Does she care for me
Who is watching me now
Who is touching me now
Do you believe in love
Oh baby
All I feel is falling
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna feel falling
I wanna, I wanna
All I feel is falling
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna feel falling
I wanna, I wanna
She is fucking weird
But I can't stop thinking of her
She disappeared through the wall
I guess I got to keep falling

Tonight may have to last me all my life,
Tonight, tonight, tonight ...

Please, don't hold me back
Please, don't hold me back, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We found some time
To break each other's heart, yeah
You said "Don't look back
And find the road to follow, yeah."
Please, don't hold me back
Please, don't hold me back, no
You said "Don't look back
And find the road to follow behind."

You fashion people in your camouflage wear
You think you're really quite up there
But the fashions you wear aren't so cool
You really should go back, you're old school
And Martin hides behind our stripes
The T-shirts yeah! that's what she likes
Nicking off with logos at cartier
The grand mister D, or Charly, some say
Fashion!
Dress-up dummies for a little while
Crashed the crash party in real chicks style
Karl and his lens they like to watch
King of the thing
But we don't give a fuck
Gucci's got the monopoly
Fifty handbags - that's victim's luxury
Voguefied in 01, enough of that fake, it's said and done
[Chorus]
Fashion is for fashion people
It's hard to be cool if you don't follow these rules
Fashion is for fashion people
Get out there now and break the rules
[Repeat Chorus]
Fashion!
Bless your dress, you're out of style
You're a brainwash victim for a while
Off with their heads is what we say
After marie antoinette it's the only way
You're a model and you walk the beat
They even told you what to eat
Bacteria inbred in fashion schools
Get out there now and break the rules
[Repeat Chorus]
It's hard

down on the other side of things
the triggers fast and light
bringing home this emptiness
for which you had to fight
it doesn't matter if your giving
for they do not compromise
the world will keep you guessing
until the day you die
and everyone will say "I told you so"
yeah they'll all just nod and sigh
but I'll make a run at something real
and they'll never even try
and everyone will say "I told you so"
yeah they'll all just nod and sigh
as I go down in a ball of flames
they'll just watch, i wonder why
When the people downtown are freezing
sometimes you cannot hide
so what can you do its often true
then we shift away our eyes
but maybe that moments ours to live
and maybe that's what we were for
as fate will share a chance with you
to open up your door
I don't understand
why your just standing there
I don't understand
why you don't seem to care

Mother of motion, the eyes can't capture time,
falling emotion, the blind now lead the blind,
we commit indescretions, and omit our sins from sight,
in a world of intangibles, too many things seem right
No hand to scribe, the sinking sickness I have seen,
no face to judge until you've been the monster I have been,
to hunger is noble, where beauty is silent sleep,
my hunger is noble, but my pain is driven deep.
Cruelty and consequence-cannot eliminate this relevance
Your selfishness, your hatefulness cannot take away my immanence
Cruelty and consequence-cannot eliminate this relevance
Your selfishness, your hatefulness cannot take away my innocence from me
Mother of motion, the eyes can't capture time,
falling emotion, the blind now lead the blind,
to hunger is noble, where beauty is silent sleep,
my hunger is noble, but my pain is driven deep.

Never leave me
Walk close beside me
Your hand my hand
Fits so easy
No tomorrow
Let us stop here
We did some great things
Didn't we?
Dry and dusty
I am a capsule of energy
You speak softly
We are capsules of energy
Work as I've been told
In return I get money
Small feet in the hall
And I long for every moment

... He wasn't responsible for the act.
I've been warned...
I believe it wrong not to warn the people.
And the machine... he come upon them and strike. ...
I understand that somebody began to...
And the song began to move up.
I understand like this. Move up.
I understand like this. ... Move up.
So, they get tired.
It was come dark and rain'll make you very tired.
And then he went and knocked on an old lady house
and old lady ran to the door, say "Who is this?
" Jack say "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?
Cause we're far from home, very tired.
" And old lady said "Oh yes, come on in." Said "Come on in.
" So I'm realizing I'm in trouble.
It was come dark and rain'll make you very tired.

Jah, Jah is real, Jah, Jah is real
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
Every day you get up and you wish to have a meal
Now you get a cut and wish to have it heal
And still you cannot accept that Jah Jah is real
Tell me Mr.Man what's the deal
You say you have everything sign and seal
Thought you won the case but not you a appeal
You are the one who couldn't hear, now you the one to feel
Evidently clear we choppin' down your shield
Dem ain't going nowhere no time soon
Dem corrupt the east and now dem turn it to the moon
Plantain your garden and wish that it will bloom
Still you're singing Satan tunes
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
Mother Earth was meant for man and woman to stay
Me find out 'nuff a dem drifting away
Children can't even find a place fi play
Birds can't find no seeds, horses no hay
I see the weavers weaving but dem income delay
Still me see dem searching for a brighter day
And now me come fi give it to you right away
Do you hear what I say
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
What happen 'em?
Give me the mic deh for a moment make me talk to dem
And watch the heathen dem a scatter when we walk to dem
And if you know you are not guilty, stand up and don't you run
To all my foes and friends
You may live to see today but you not know the end
Just read the writings on the wall, it's a message we send
And Babylon will never live to stop the rising of Jah son
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone so far away, dem gone
The hole a dem ago regret it one day

Another land, another culture
With a different kind of life
What was once forbidden
Belongs here to social life
While you travel to those countries
You can live a thousand lives
In a castle somewhere in Britain
Or a temple down in asia
Give me a golden shower
Give me a new thrill
Give me this experience
And give me the last kill
Give me almighty power
Give me a strong will
Give me a new life
And give me the final thrill
Hatred, boredom and the lies
Plenty of false moral rules
Breaking them in many ways
You don't belong to these fools

When I bear my soul again
Don't go wasting my time
I'm giving it my all, believe me that I'm yours
And you're mine
I'm giving it my all, believe me
You don't seem to care
Say what you have to say, don't mislead me
Don't you dare
I'm still trying, I can't do any more
I've loved you all my life

One day the day will come
And all will settle
Before you know what happened
And when you speak of dreams
You'll only have one
Before you know what's happened
Slow, gets slow
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
Listen to it slow, gets slow
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
My friend your solid gold
Won't be here long
Before the gold has traveled
One day the day will come
When we'll be sayin' goodbye
Before you know what's happened
(Give a little gold)
All that you're keeping will be all gone (Give a little gold)
In the spaces where you fit in (Give a little gold)
These pieces are apart of you (Give a little gold)
Tie them together again (Give a little gold)
(Give a little gold)
All that you're keeping will be all gone (Give a little gold)
In the spaces where you fit in (Give a little gold)
These pieces are apart of you (Give a little gold)
Tie them together again
Slow, gets slow
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
Listen to it slow, gets slow
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat
The rhythm of love is an irregular beat

My angel make him dream of me tonight
Just tell him I'm alone, he'll hold me tight
Angel of love
Angel of love
Why don't you try
My angel wipe the dark clouds from the sky
My angel let our lovelight shine on bright
Angel of love
Teach my heart how to fly

Concentrate, listen to me, while you do me
Should I surrender when you pursue me
You think a man don't have heart and soul
When a hand's that good, anybody will fold
It's like poetry in motion
But the heart regulates the devotion
Love is floatin' in a sky blue ocean
Think about it
Feel the motion, young queen
It reminds me of a smoothed out movie scene
Two bodies intertwined on the screen
Everybody makes love in their dreams
But this is real, know what I mean
Passion is the way of the world
Electricity when boy meets girl
And making love is the key
A burning flame that will last eternally
You should know that I'm here for you
As long as you see me through
I would give all I have just to be with you
Don't you see honey it could be me and you
I really look forward to being with you
When you're not around I don't know what to do
You give me a feeling that I can't control
You take my heart and soul
[Chorus:]
Never question what I do
Cause you need me baby and I need you
So there's no need for ya to have no fears
Without a doubt I will be here
Now I know what I want to do
Everything's all right as long as I'm with you
Oh, don't you understand I don't want to be alone
Baby don't you know
I really look forward to being with you
When you're not around I don't know what to do
You give me a feeling that I can't control
You take my heart and soul
[Chorus x2]
Never question
(You should never question)
Cause you need me baby
(Yeah boy)
So there's no need for ya
Without a doubt I will be here
[Chorus To Fade]

All right?
Dancing floor for you is ready
Step on a step
Don't be so shy
Carry on
Dance with us!
Stomp hard on (the) beat
Let's start together
Dive into the bass drums you hear
This shit is still just a damn warm up you know
Oh! Let us get high now!
Oh! Let us get extremely high right now!
"Damn it"
She is still not turning back to me today
I can never be honest to myself
I'm about to give it all up after all
The day I was waiting for
It's (the) day I was waiting for
The moment suddenly appeared
When I stood on that low stage
You were there in the front row of the crowd!
All right?
Dancing floor for you is ready
Step on a step
Don't be so shy
Carry on
Dance with us!
Stomp hard on (the) beat
Let's start together
I just want to see your biggest smile
Might seem like a dream but it ain't, it is here
Oh yeah! let us get high now!
There are people inside you just can't deal with
So it ain't easy to gather hearts to one
Fighting since monkeys, and probably will be the same now on.
Still fighting. just like the ancient days
We are still fighting from ages ago
But here, there is a drip of hope
Making big noise, and we come along with the flow of the noise
And we can become one
There is a small little hope
"Dance tune it is"
We have been hitting the floor from the days we were born
Sound will keep changing but what we do won't change
We have been hitting the floor from when we were born
It's all the same since we were apes

You're on thin fucking ice, my pedigree chum, and I shall be under it when it breaks.
You're on thin fucking ice
thin fucking ice
You're on thin fucking ice, my pedigree chum, and I shall be under it when it breaks
Now FUCK OFF.

I dreamed about you again last night.
You never have the same face twice,
But I always know it's you,
And you're always looking better than you really do.
Than you really do.
And I walk around the whole next day
Feeling like I've still got something to say.
But I don't know what it is,
And I don't know how to reach you even if I did.
Even if I did.
Do I want to hear that you forgive me?
Do I want to hear you're no good without me?
Am I big enough to hear that you never even think about me?
Why should you ever think about me?
And I thought that I'd outgrow this kind of thing.
Tell me, aren't we supposed to mature or something?
I haven't found that yet, is this as grown-up as we ever get?
Maybe this is as good as it gets.
And years may go by, but I think the heart remains a child.
The mind may grow wise, but the heart just sulks and it whines and remains a child.
I think the heart remains a child.
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?

Step outside
Can feel the warmth
Much stronger than inside
Crazy path that led you here
Creates a place too high.
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
Frightened eyes taking the view
Forgetting how it feels
Look around, believe yourself
The world outside is real
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
Gave myself to you,
No one can deny
I'm still waiting 'til you be
So content to feel,
Can't despise myself
I'm still waiting 'til
Leave me break my heart
Can't control the pain
I'm still waiting 'til.

every little step you take
every little move you make
they're watching you they're watching you
without respect for your life
Everywhere are microphones
they listen all day and night
to every tiny word you speak
in your very little world
so you better speak a word
keep the silence in your heart
no more shoutings anywere
until they leave you
every little step you take
every little move you make
they're watching you they're watching you
without respect for your life

Can't you find something else to talk about?
Is this song the only one you sing?
Makes you look better when you put things down?
Value your opinion!
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
Don't criticize my life style
I'm fed up 'cause all you want to do is criticize.
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You don't realize, all you want to do is criticize.
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize.
Now can't we talk this over?
Cause your conversation ain't right.
We can make our love stronger
You don't have to think twice.
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
Don't criticize my motive
Criticize my feeling
Don't criticize my business
I'm fed up 'cause all you want to do is criticize.
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!

His embrace a fortress
It fuels me and places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Stone by stone
If you ask yourself
Patiently and carefully
Who is it, who is it
Who is it
That never lets you down
Who is it
That gave you back your crown
And the ornaments are
They're goin' around
Now they're handin' it over
They're handin' it over, handin' it over
Who is it
That never lets you down
Who is it
That gave you back your crown
And the ornaments are
They're goin' around
Now they're handin' it over
Handin' it over
He demands a closeness
We all have earned a lightness
Carry my joy on the left
Carry my pain on my right
If you ask yourself now
Patiently and carefully
Who is it
Who is it
That never lets you down
Who is it
That gave you back your crown
The ornaments are
They're goin' around
And they're handin' it over
Handin' it over, handin'
Who is it
That never lets you down
Who is it
That gave you back your crown
The ornaments are
They're goin' around
And they're handin' it over
Handin' it over

I would like if you could see,
that something different's what we need.
If I said change,
I'd hope you'd say yes.
Because everybody knows you're just a problem
that looks great in a little black dress.
Dressed to impress
You know we need one more throwdown,
with no opinions or changes of heart.
You know we needed this right from the start.
(x2)
Well I'll be fine 'cause you left me,
a little time for me to be, someone else
someone without you.
So I'll give what you took right back.
Live like I wish I had.
You didn't treat me right,
but you didn't want to.
If it's real why can't we see it?
If it's so strong why can't we feel it?
'Cause it's all gone, you'd better believe it.
It feels so wrong, but you know I need this
You know we need one more throwdown- (x4)

This is why we won't delay for your birthday
Secrets that we held that day will be kept straight
All your friends have gone away, so let's celebrate
Your holding hope open for the one, making you wait
Lights and music, are on my mind
Be my baby, one more time
Lights and music, are on my mind
Be my baby, one more time
Coding crystals you cant hide as your tears race
I'll be waiting by in time, put your dreams away
Your holding hope open for the one, making you wait
Lights and music, are on my mind
Be my baby, one more time
Lights and music, are on my mind
Be my baby, one more time

Take me from the city
Let's go for a drive
Take me, Take me anywhere
Just make me feel alive
Make me feel this fire
Higher than the sun
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
We could save our money
We could buy a house
Hit back on our patio
Watching fireflies
We could feel this fire
Higher than the sun
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

Going out tonight
Like I ain't never left the house before, oh
I'm all laced up tight
Feelin' so fly as I walk out the door, oh
Heels hit the pavement like a drum
So you know they hear me come
When I strut in
Like I own the club
And I'm not wasting any time
So I'm makin' a b line
Underneath the spot light
You'll find me there all night
Cause these boots were made for dancin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
When I move, the whole world's watchin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sweat drippin' off the ceiling
There ain't no concealing
My body's revealing, woah oh
Don't you know that these boots
Were made for dancin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I'm starting a fire
This white hot leather's smoking up the room, oh
I'm electrified
I whip my hair to the music
My body's so into it, I'm so in tune
And I'm just here to have fun
Go hard 'til I see the sun rise
Blazin', we sh-shuttin' it down
And the DJ's a friend of mine
Turn it up we getting so live
Ain't no stoppin' us now
Cause these boots were made for dancin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
When I move, the whole world's watchin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sweat drippin' off the ceiling
There ain't no concealing
My body's revealing, woah oh
Don't you know that these boots
Were made for dancin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Dirty, dirty dancin' the way I feel
Nothin' else can quite match it
When I put my boots on
Feels like I'm so far gone
I'm lost in the music
I'm ready to do this
All night long
These boots were made for dancin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
When I move, the whole world's watchin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sweat drippin' off the ceiling
There ain't no concealing
My body's revealing, woah oh
Don't you know that these boots
Were made for dancin'
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
These boots were made for dancin'
Yea yea yea
Made for dancin'
Yea yea yea

[Verse 1:]
I see it in your eyes
Yeah you make me feel uncomfortable
I know, I know I turn to mud
Yeah you lead me to the edge again
[Chorus:]
There you go taking all I follow
Got me hanging by a thread again
Talking all I follow

Yeah you lead me to the edge again
[Chorus:]
There you go taking all I follow
Got me hanging by a thread again
Talking all I follow

Can you do me a solid?
Don't drag me down
Cause I'm hanging by a thread again
[Refrain:]
Did you feel it coming?
Did you feel it all?
Cause I don't know where we went wrong

There is no more time left,what is your side,
Will you live like traitor,or fight with the pride.
Lets finish this,talks will get us nowhere,
Time to line up in your last fucking warfare.
I dont need to depend on anyone,
Who the fuck they think they are?
Droping a bomb on somebody whos in their way,
Making fake earthquake,what more can i say?
They say,they dont know whos killing the planet,
And their holding loaded gun,with their fingerprints at it.
When will people learn,when will they stop suffer,
Time to digg them grave with our shovel.
Theyve gone to far,time to put an end to it,
No excuse,time for them to see our bullet.
God is watching every single step of them,
But still we are burning in hell with rest of them.
So many bulshits people had to live,
Who knows maybe we are all radioactive.
But that is not our biggest problem,we are on their track,
Problem is that our alies are gonna put knife in our back.
The war is around us,all they long they are planing to brake us,
To brake the whole world so they can bee numer one.
But all we are doing is siting on our ass and leting them pass,
First day of world there was a heaven,after them there wont be grass.
Theyve gone to far,time to put an end to it,
No excuse,time for them to see our bullet.
God is watching every single step of them,
But still we are burning in hell with rest of them.
There is no more time left,what is your side,
Will you live like traitor,or fight with the pride.
Lets finish this,talks will get us nowhere,
Time to line up in your last fucking warfare.
Theyve gone to far,time to put an end to it,
No excuse,time for them to see our bullet.
God is watching every single step of them,
But still we are burning in hell with rest of them.

As the salmon swim upstream, reddened with decay
To die there in their birthplace, so will I change
As the stream becomes inert and the wildflowers fade
As the forest turns to desert, so will I change
When the devil appeared, I locked him in a box
Sure if it opened, that he would eat me up
Oh, how I feared at what my fate might be
I couldn't see, locked in that box, that love held the key
Strands disentwine, and realign, an egg divides, cells multiply
And so I'm told that I was born of halves, and I then so remained
Halves reunite a single slave
The mind a lorn enclave both hateful and attrite,
the body turned a grave of muddy appetites
If the truth is an open mind, love is an open heart
Love cannot be unkind, love is blind
The mind is a deathcamp apart from love so divine
Love in its own time, love has its own designs
The mingling of two souls in transformation, encoded in this chain
Through all transfiguration, all essence must remain, all is changelessly in change
Come out, the winter's over, come out into the day
Come out, the winter's over, no season ever stays
All is changelessly in change
If the truth is an open mind, love is an open heart
Love cannot be unkind, love is blind
The mind is a deathcamp apart, from the love of an open heart
Love in its own time, love is divine, love has its own designs
Love is changelessly in change
Love is change

You've waited for so long
To be where you are and
Where you're comin from
And you gave it all so much, yeah
In return for human love
You've waited all this time
But the sweetest thrill is the one you've yet to find
And you started to believe
It's not all as it may seem
When you've waited for so long
To be where you are and
Where you're comin from
And you gave it all so much
In return for human love
...return for human love...
In return for human love...
All the pleasures that you'll find
Don't the expect a thrill like the blind the blind
To a world where you belong
For a moment then it's gone, gone, gone
When you've waited for so long
To be where you are and
Where you're comin from, yeah
And you gave it all so much
In return for human love
...return for human love...
In return for human love...
...return for human love...
...love...
And you've waited for so long
To be where you are and
Where you're comin from, yeah
And you gave it all so much
In return for human love
...return for human love...
In return for human love
...return for human love...
In return for human love

Is reach into the heart of you
Is as simple and true as the love you inspire in me
So let me fall
If I go, would you wait? Would you wonder
Would you know what I'm thinking and why I'm ashamed
Of the girl I am and the stranger that I became
Hold tight to the heart of an angel you'll never know
'Cause her face looks a little like mine
And it keeps you going just knowing I'm here tonight
So let me fall, let me love you
Let me free your inner child
Let me sit inside your silence
Let me ease the hurt you hide
'Cause I'm alive, I'm unlucky
I'm a line too fine to trace
But I could be your consolation
If you'd be my saving grace
My wild world is the shape of a sound that can't be heard
But it rings when I'm unraveled by you
There's a quiet storm and my skin gets torn and I wake brand new
Higher and brighter than yesterday
But I'm still a dark, mysterious night
When the sun descends and the moon leads you to my side
So let me fall, let me love you
Let me free your inner child
Let me sit inside your silence
Let me ease the hurt you hide
'Cause I'm alive, I'm unlucky
I'm a line too fine to trace
But I could be your consolation
If you'd be my saving grace
Is reach into the heart of you
Is as simple and true as the love you inspire in me
So let me fall
Is reach into the heart of you
Is as simple and true as the love you inspire in me
So let me fall, let me fall

I was given wine
We feeling okay ?
And we're quite all right
You wash my tears away
And make me wanna stay
And bonfires lit up the shores
Walk far far away
To go beside you
Is where I want to be
Walk far far way
To laugh, to love
Days are roses and wine
Drifting astray
With your hand in mine
You stroke my fears away
You make me wanna stay
And bonfires lit up the shores
Walk far far way
To go beside you
Is where I want to be
Walk far far way
To laugh, to love
Walk far far away
Where to go and hide it?
We're going to the sea
Walk far far away
To laugh, to love
This is how it went
I am here to stay
Roaring with the wind
There's life within
This is what I give
A circle is complete
Another circle spins
There's life within
Within

You always laugh
when I cry
I'm always looking to tomorrow
as you mourn the days gone by
You always stepped
on my toes
Took my guide in hand of love
is helping everywhere you go
I'm always wrong
you're always right
But I can see right through the lies
Till the never changing light
Rain on me
my arms are cold
I want to get home
but there's water on the road
And if I do
you will not change
I'm just a singing satellite
and another dirty strange.
I want to laugh
I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
and stop me thinking for a while
I'm just a fool
I'm gonna sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am the king
The king
The king of everything and nothing
I'm on my way to heaven
I'm always here
I'm in denial
When there's nothing left between us
I will stay another while
You know you're free
You've got your wings
And I am just another angel
With a voice who wants to sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All mighty
I'm on my way to heaven
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on my way to heaven
I want to cry
I want to steal
A little ray of perfect sunshine
From the sun above your head
I want to laugh
I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
Stop me thinking through our love
I'm just a fool
Oh I'm gonna sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am the king
The king
The king of everything and nothing
I'm on my way to heaven

As we fall into sequence
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care
If I'm lost please don't find me
If I jump let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink
When it's cold outside hold me
Don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me
Don't coax me
When it's cold outside hold me
Don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me
Don't coax me
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care
Have they cleansed you with chloride
And scrubbed behind the knees
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze

Clap your hands right
Clap your hands etc
Let him to my bed
Throbbing in my head
Nothing could be said
You wouldn't understand
Ripped him from my breast
My lover failed the test
Shed him from my skin
Too long he's livin' in
I love bad behavior
Addicted you might say
It's hidden in my nature
It's a fix I obey
Baby don't you sweat
I've got plans for you
I don't make idle threats
But I've got no respect
And I feel so alone yeah
Lover I feel so alone
Ooh yeah
Inject me I'm your flavour
You know what's good for you
Nothinga gonna save you
When the poison drips through
Led him to my bed Throbbing in my head X2

you say I'm not afraid but I linger.
the pleasures still the same.
she gets sicker.
I'll break your heart, if I can't stay
it's more than I might be safe to play.
It's hidden in the clouds where I can see
how easily my mind could just break free
Arise sweet demon and have your say
I deserve nothing, but fortunes way
arise sweet demon and have your say
I'll break your heart, but I can't stay

Where do we go? Michael
Look out here I come
Michael Jackson look what you've done
Michael Jackson
Tina Turner

Think I met you somewhere in my dreams
And you held this feeling deep inside
Let me with your Visions haunting Demon
And I wish so hard, I think I cried
Would you be?
Could you be?
Tigerlilly is your maiden name
And you seem so young and yet so wise
Your heart filled with so much tragedy
Though I'd only see it in your Eyes
Would you be?
Could you be?
Jesus Christ, please
You know what it is, what you mean to me
Take my Hand, please
Show me what it is, what I mean to be
Once you held me in your nervous blow
And I thought I never be the same
Now you've lost me in this drunkenness I get
So sleep away my guilt and shame
Would you be?
Could you be?
Jesus Christ, please
You know what it is what you mean to me
Take my Hand, please
Show me what it is, what I mean to be

You never got to bloom
They cut you from the stem
You're innocent at birth
Until you understand
Repeat every word that you say to me
They put you to use or put you to sleep
I cant tell you the difference between
An embryo or a planted seed
So many shades of white
So many shades of pale
I know what you hate
So I do it constantly
Many shades of white
Many shades of pale
I know how to cut
A wound that will not heal
Consistency of dirt
Insects that spun your silk
They wait for gratitude
They wait for mother's milk
Repeat every word that you say to me
They put you to use or put you to sleep
I cant tell you the difference between
An embryo or a planted seed
So many shades of white
So many shades of pale
I know what you hate
So I do it constantly
Many shades of white
Many shades of pale
I know how to cut
A wound that will not heal

Give your morning sigh
Give your morning sigh
He will see you now,
Come and take your bow
Nothing seems in place
You want to find your face
You realize your mistake
So give your morning sigh
Wake up, and take a night on the city
You can run to the light but you'll never find what you're looking for
Wake up, and run with the sinners
You'll find that everything are in the pieces that you left behind
Do you see the light?
Do you realize?
You finally saw too late
So give your morning sigh

Ow!
Ho!
A lot of people say that you can make it in this world today.
But, I know exactly how, I'd like to show ya if you let me now.
Just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line just be yourself. Just be yourself put it on the line!
If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just...say it. Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?
Sometimes it might take long to clear your mind and make yourself feel strong.
I know its worth the wait just tighten up and keep your head on straight. Just be yourself say what's on your mind just be yourself.
Put it on the line just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line!
If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just, say it. Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?
You've got to get your nerve up
Your nerve up
Your nerve up
You've got to get your nerve up
Your nerve up
Your nerve up

You told me you don't feel like, coming around
A year ago, that'd be the strangest sound
You told me we could talk about this yesterday, but you avoided me you sure we're okay?
You told me you got things going on inside your head, it's not about me, but everything instead
You told me all you needed space and a little time, to work out all the things that's going on in your mind
Hold on tight, we're gonna take a fall
It's gonna hurt, I've taken one before
I'd love to fight, but I've said and tried it all
The dance is over, and the band left the hall
Ohoh yeaheh
ohoh yeaheh
ohoh yeaheh
woohoo yeaheh (2x)
Don't waste your pity, you've seen me cry
And I don't need your sympathy since you stopped trying
and I can see your love has gone
so please for me, stop holding on
Ohoh yeaheh
ohoh yeaheh
ohoh yeaheh
woohoo yeaheh (2x)
I know tonight when I close my eyes, yeah
I wonder really what is on the horizon
I know I really need to pick up the dice and just go
I know that I'll be trying to call, trying to find the little crack in the wall
Trying to see the little light in your soul and go
Ohoh yeaheh
ohoh yeaheh
ohoh yeaheh
woohoo yeaheh
Hold on tight, we're gonna take a fall
It's gonna hurt, I've taken one before
I'd love to fight, but I've said and tried it all
The dance is over, and the band left the hall

Stars are fun she said with a beautiful smile
As I looked above and stuffed her side
Astrology is not my cup of tea
I'd rather go inside and watch some TV
What about clouds
I think you should give it a try
But watching clouds is something you wanna do tonight
I hope you understand it's been a bad week
But it's not for me, no it's not for me
[Chorus]
Maybe it's been so long I've been waiting
Oh baby just call it off or call me crazy
We walked inside and watched TV for a while
The news crept me out the x put me down
I got so bored to death
And than outside the bugs starting eating me up
I felt so bad I looked up to the sky
The stars the clouds the moon the beautiful light
It all made sense but just for a while
But it's not for me, no it's not for me
[Chorus: x4]

Lately I've been feeling different,
Like I've come from outer space,
And I notice something missing
When it's you I can't replace
And as I walk into the sun
And as I stare across this ocean
And as I start a brand new day
But I felt we'd be the same, again.
Up ahead there in the distance
Shadows coming through the haze
You're the only one that listens
To help me break loose from these chains,
And as I walk into the sun
And as I stare across this ocean
And as I start a brand new day
But I felt we'd be the same, again.
The same again
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
And as I walk into the sun
And as I stare across this ocean
And as I start a brand new day
But I felt we'd be the same, again.
And as I walk into the sun
And as I stare across this ocean
And as I start a brand new day
But I felt we'd be the same, again.

I've missed you so much now I'm whole again
Come, come tonight
Just hold me tight
This desert rain you're my guiding light
We, We were close
This world of pain
I've missed you so much now I'm whole again
Come, come tonight
Just hold me tight
This desert rain you're my guiding light
We, we were lost
This world of time
We forgot about love, We forgot about us
Now I am here
Dreams become real
I feel like a sand that's blown away
back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain

I am in this mood
It's good, it's the best place to be
I got in
I got in
I got in to the mood
This great big balloon
Carrying me to the sky
Above everything
Above you
Balloon mood
Balloon mood
I'm in a balloon mood

Oooooo [x3]
Staring me down in the mirror
How long will it take til these cracks disappear?
Feeling ashamed, forgetting my name
Where did I go?
Praying to God for a cure
It's so dysfunctional here in the hurt
Lost and confused, feeling the wounds
Where do I go?
Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive
Oooooo [x3]
Climbing the height of my walls
Watching them crumble beneath me in awe
I will be brave, I will be safe
Here in your arms
Now there's no room for afraid
Breaking the boundaries to make myself brave
Hearing the change, turning the page
And now I am free
Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive
Oooooo [x3]
Ahhhhh
Give it all away, give it all away
It's gonna be okay, gonna be okay
I give it all away, give it all away
It's gonna be okay, gonna be okay
Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive, oh alive
Every dim shade of gray in my scars
All of the mess I have left in the dark
Still the light shines through the cracks in my heart
It's proof I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
Ohhhhh [x3]
I'm alive, I'm alive

Deep river runs its course
To a warm horizon
Shadows of falling leaves
October moon and rusty skies
Ever changing feelings
The seeds of autumn in my mind
The hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
Hiding summer's age no more
No more leaves in summer sky
Turning dark on empty car lots
When summer was my only friend
Say you're back this way again
Winter's one breath away
Say you're back this way again
Winter's one breath away
It's turning cold
Like the hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
The hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
Like the hiding sun
Like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun

Suburbia, one a.m.
You're walking home again
Shopping bags and broken glass
I hate going through the underpass
I wish there was some other way around
But you got beaten up by the playground
And it's no use
You'll have to go through
Suburban shopping center
Pedestrian walkways
I think they were meant to make things better
It's just emptier
The scary nighttime
Hatfield, at that time
This is the place I live
Where is everyone?
Are we the only ones?
This is the place I live
And so does everyone
And so does everyone
Hatfield nineteen eighty
I'm seeing my first knife
My first ambulance ride
I hold your hand the whole way crying
Get home the next day
Police have already been
Well, you can imagine the scene
And if I'm going home
I better change my clothes
I better change my clothes
This is the place I live
Where is everyone?
Are we the only ones?
This is the place I live
And so does everyone
And so does everyone
When I'm looking back
I look for everyone
And when I fall down
I fall for everyone

Cross my heart and look into the sea
Cross my arms and turn to me
Turn to me instead of telling the truth
And now, now I can honor you
Since you've left, all we're talking about
Is different problems
While I'm dragging my heels
So long to be my mother
So long to be my friend
Will you talk to me? I'm real bored
We're in the house, looking at the dark
If you learn to follow me
I'll know that you can honor me
Since you've left, all we're talking about
Is different problems
While I'm dragging my heels
So long to be my mother
So long to be my friend
You're covered in the lotion
That was inside of me
I'll throw you in the ocean
I'll pass you to the sea
You're covered in the lotion
That was inside of me
I'll throw you in the ocean
I'll pass you to the sea
If this is love
Then I'm fucking proud of it
If this is love
Then I'm fucking proud of it
If this is love
Then I'm fucking proud of it
If this is love
Then I'm fucking proud of it

What is it that makes you do
Things that will bring harm to you
What is it that fills your head
And keeps you in your smoky bed
What is it that makes you lie
To yourself you don't know why
What is it that has the power
To keep you coming back for more
You're blinded eyes
What is it that makes you drink
Destroys your mind so you can't think
What is it that makes you take
Another fix, there's no escape
What is it you sacrifice
Your everything, your very life
What is it that pulls you down
And kicks you when you're on the ground
You're running dry
Is there some place I can go
Is there some place I can lie
Take me under your wing
I need to fill this space inside
Made in a shape of light
Vocoder
What is it that ties your hands
Trips you up and claims the land
What is it that makes you laugh
For a while, then all is dry
What is it that pushes you
Closer to the edge, each time
What is it that makes you pay
You're giving everything away
It's time to rise
Is there some place I can go
Is there some place I can lie
Take me under your wing
I need to fill this space inside
Is there some place I can go
Is there some place I can lie
Take me under your wing
I need to fill this space inside
Made in a shape of light
Vocoder
Is there some place I can go
Is there some place I can lie
Take me under your wing
I need to fill this space inside
Is there some place I can go
Is there some place I can lie
Take me under your wing
I need to fill this space inside
Made in a shape of light

Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
Your alarm call's on,
And I'm coming to your rescue.
I know exactly what to do,
I make the call and sit by you,
Check your heartbeat against mine,
And mop your brow from time to time.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
Your alarm call's on,
And I'm coming to your rescue.
I'm the person by your side,
I'm your mentor I'm your guide,
Upon me you can rely,
When you're high and when you're dry.
The irony is, that my recovery is always slower than yours.
You're back on your feet in no time,
When I'm left floored.
Haunted by the sound of your alarm call.
Living in fear of your next fall.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
Your alarm call's on,
And I'm coming to your rescue.
I know exactly what to do,
I make the call and sit by you,
Check your heartbeat against mine,
But there's no trace of it this time.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
My siren's on,
And there's so many things that I need you to do.
I never asked when you were here,
Because it seemed so crystal clear,
That it was you who needed me,
That was the way it had to be.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
My siren's on,
And there's so many things that I need you to do.
Be my mentor, be my guide,
Show me when to run and where to hide,
I know you would have known just what to do,
With all the things a life could throw at you.
My siren will remain on for awhile,
Waiting soundproof, by a timid little smile.
I'm still haunted by your alarm call,
Without the fear,
Of your next,
Fall.

Can't stop spacing, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing, and when I'm on the cloud
My feet square on the ground
My head up in the clouds, looking down, out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again, after that
Can't stop spacing out, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Yeah nigga, shoot 'em all, throw 'em right now
Starin' at ya sweatin' my wallys
My mind got vivid thoughts of what I'm supposed to be doin'
Got the blue and the cream, me and Rah blowin' steam
Sittin' with Tarrentin', nigga stackin' the green
Roll rockin', fan fuckin'
Snatchin' up mics at award shows, rollin' up O's
Wu clothes, my flows are so detrimental
Space cadet keep a cassette of instrumentals
Sling slang the track like 'dick the hoes'
Super intelligent, verbally diminish the pros
A visionary, my mind's like a rhyme war-zone
You can't postpone the inevitable, king of the thrones
Ghostface
Can't stop spacing, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing, and when I'm on the cloud
My feet square on the ground
My head up in the clouds, looking down, out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again, after that
Can't stop spacing out, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream

How much black youth behind iron curtain
Thrue mi naw go trod inna Babylon order
Mi haffi bun fire fi one name Seaga
Everyday cost a living get harder
Have more seller more than buyer
Oh my Lord , what a pressure
Chorus
Verse 3:
So many things politician have stolen
Still them return with the one Bruce Golding
Saying a brand new party dem forming
But a part dem a part we with dem politics meeting
Out A politics poor people get them beaten
Look who dem have a tun metropolitan officer
Fi tek yuh hustling out a yuh hand
When yuh look pon dem face a yuh own black man
Well out of the slum di poor people send mi
Fi look what a gwaan and don't disagree
What is the benefit of GCT?
It benefit you but it never fit me.
Chorus

hide to show what we are
empty graves to the open gap in the sky
to overcome this futile life

Moments of perfection
Idle in the sunshine
Over there in Honda
In another world
I'm not your kind
I'm not your girl
Dreams we had seen bright
A pastel time
Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini
Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini
Sunlight in your eyes
Driving over stateside
Left the smoke behind glass
Could we be together
In another world
I'm not your kind
I'm not your girl
See I'm in your car
But not your life
Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini
Cologne cerrone, cerrone Houdini
Cerrone Houdini
[x2]
Sunlight in your eyes
Sunlight in eyes
Like dirty mud in your hair

You soldiers love is muddy dirt Yes Sir yes Sir

But when we're through you'll get a rest Yo yo yes Sir
Ejo zak zak zak Captain Jack is coming back
Turn it up, turn it down, move it all around
Pow wow tak tak tak come and fight for Captain Jack
You say yes, you say no, just say yes to start the show
Give me a hundred sit ups, fools Yes Sir yes Sir

No more conversation
I know who you are
Let's take this no further
or I may go so far
as to keep you from leaving
I would like to see
you begging, barely breathing
leaving on your knees (on your knees)
Oh, the things that I'd do
the things that I'd do
I'd do to you if only
I could do all the things that I want to
if only you... you knew all the things I'd do
the things that I'd do
if you knew what I'd do
if I told you, you would keep me from you
No more false pretension
You know who I am
Let's end this flirtation
You already have given me inspiration
far more than I need
to reclaim your lost smile
searching on my knees
Oh, the things that I'd do
the things that I'd do
I'd do to you if only
I could do all the things that I want to
if only you knew all the things I'd do
the things that I'd do
if you knew what I'd do
if I told you, you would keep me from you
You won't feel again that gentle touch
you hate so much
so I must refrain, 'cause what I'd like
you'd love too much
Oh, the things that I'd do
the things that I'd do
I'd do to you if only
I could do all the things that I want to
if only you... you knew all the things I'd do
the thing that I'd do
if you knew what I'd do
if I told you, you would keep me close to you

[Chorus]
Give love a chance.
Give love a chance.
Give love a chance to shine all through the earth.
If we would all put hate aside,
Then we might live to see love have a chance.
[Chorus]
If we would all put hate aside,
Then we might live to see love have a chance.
[Chorus]
If we would all put hate aside,
Then we might live to see love have a chance.
Then we might live to see love have a chance.

Girl was so fine, fine, fine

And me damn near broke my neck
On everything me know
On her, everything a yes
Excuse a rudeboy but she the finest in this b*tch
Pardon my naughty language
Just speaking her body language
She start moving like a snake
I start screaming like Bigga Rankin
I hope she ain't taken, I don't think i could take it
Movado got her winding like Moscato which she drinking
She move her hips like she from the same place Rihanna is (Barbados)
Open her lips sound like she kin to Nicki's mama nem (Ahh Trinidad)
Or she might just be from Kingston like Sean and nem (Jamaica)
Girl was all that like her got roots tied to all of them
Exactly what me call a ten
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Damn it is a shame
She all up on me brain and me not even know her name
But I know her body bang bang bang
And she hot as flame flame flames
Drop down with the wine bout blew my mind
Girls off the chain chain chain
So it's like get it girl, get it girl
Represent yo city girl
Might not know her name but know she represents for pretty girls
Drop dead gorgeous, All of that
Beauty's her name, Me'll call her that
She saw me apparent she was staring where the ballers at
From the same place Rihanna is (Barbados)
Open her lips sound like she kin to Nicki's Mama nem (Ahh Trinidad)
Or she might just be from Kingston like Sean and nem (Jamaica)
Girl was all that like her got roots tied to all of them
Exactly what me call a ten
[Hook]

Don't Fall Asleep...
Don't Fall Asleep...
I just want your hand
walking through the dark house
of symphony of highrony
Falls at your feet
Don't fall asleep
(2x)
Take a pill
Don't you sleep
your soft face is always in my dreams
Wake you up
your speaking in tongues
your speaking in tongues
about our love...
I just want your hand
walking through the dark house
of symphony of highrony
Falls at your feet
Don't fall asleep
We'll take it slow
Until we get home
Laughing at the jokes we used to know
I'll keep you warm
Until the night gets cold
Until the full moon
Takes us home.....
Lets just pretend...
again and again.
Lets just pretend...
again and again.

Oh, darling, I miss you.
An boy has it hard
The thought of you leavin'
Is breakin' my heart
New York, New York, temperature's droppin'
The band's out shoppin', not stoppin' 'til ears pop
Cops protect shops, lots of yellow cabs and bellhops
And it never stops
I'm waitin' to do an interview, so much to tell you
Today I feel close enough to smell you
Additional dates they were plannin' just fell through
Florida's out
We fly September 22 to Heathrow, but there's not really long to go
Tonight will be a brilliant show
Lettin' you know I miss you
More than four hits the floor at a party
Send my love to everybody
Oh, darling, I miss you
An boy has it hard
The thought of you leavin'
Is breakin' my heart
Honey, I'm writin' from d.c., feelin' queasy
Stayin' healthy on the road isn't easy
The tm. recommends an antigen
One of them could resist taking a piss
I miss you like a lock in the door
What's more, I go to sleep with my walkman 'cause half the crew snored
Don't mean to be a bore, everybody's been great,
But there's fifteen of us in a bus state-to-state
So I stay up late with a tape, or meditate
My bed is travellin' at fifty-five m.p.h.
When we make it to la, I'll still be miles away
It's not my best day
Oh, darling, I miss you
God bless
An boy has it hard.
The thought of you leavin'
Is breakin' my heart.
If these walls can hold you,
My house will be down.
If these walls can hold you,
My house will be down.
Oh, darling, I miss you,
My house will be down.
Oh, darling, we urge you
My house will be down.
Oh, darling, I miss you

I feel that magic moment, when I hold you in my arms
I wish that it could always be, but I know you've got to go
Then I will wait until you're here again, remember the things from now and then
Even if you're a hundred years away, I'll be waiting till that day
That day, that day, that day... (fade)
Magic moment, Magic moment
Magic moment, Magic moment
Magic moment, Magic moment
I feel that magic moment, when I hold you in my arms
I wish that it could always be, but I know you've got to go
Then I will wait until you're here again, remember the things from now and then
Even if you're a hundred years away, I'll be waiting till that day
That day, that day, that day... (fade)
Magic moment, Magic moment
Magic moment, Magic moment

I had to see you again
Can't understand it
Just want to feel you again
I couldn't help it
Guess I'm falling in love with you

I wanna be where I can't be found
And I don't need anybody around
And I have to leave 'cause this is my escape
I wanna see, just walk away
Don't look for me, I'll be out of sight
This is the place to be
Come on out and fight
Come on out of the fight
Come on out of the fight
Come on out of the fight
I wanna be where I can't be found
And I don't need anybody around
And I have to leave 'cause this is my escape
I wanna see, just walk away
Don't look for me, I'll be out of sight
This is the place to be
Come on out and fight
Come on out of the fight
Come on out of the fight
Come on out of the fight
I wanna be where I can't be found
And I don't need anybody around
And I have to leave 'cause this is my escape
I wanna see, just walk away
Don't look for me, I'll be out of sight
This is the place to be
Come on out and fight
Come on out of the fight
Come on out of the fight

She doesn't want me around
She's got something to hide
I think she want's a clown, someone to take for a ride
What I keep telling her
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride
And I know its not my foolish pride
She hates the sight of me
Because I turned her offer down
She's always saying we were meant to be
Somehow she thought Id be her clown
And this is what I sing
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride
And I know its not my foolish pride
She doesn't want me around
She's got something to hide
I think she want's a clown, someone to take for a ride
This is what I sing
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride
And I know its not my foolish pride

If you want to know me, know me
Gotta show what you know
And then show me
Ooh it's a feeling
And I know, do you know
That I'm dealing
If you want to throw me, throw me
Gotta show that it's love that witholds me
Ooh, I'm fizzing up nicely
Plutonium beats, they define me
I've got some mochomo cake
Strawberry mousse, it will make your heart quake
Ooh she's a liar, waxen with the scent of pariah
She took it all to Venus City
Where the girl showed a whole lot of pity
If you want to scold me, scold me
Don't beat around the bush and dethrone me
Ooh it's a feeling
And you know, do you know, that I'm reeling
If you want to shame me, blame me
Let it out, it will turn around and save me
Ooh the angels didn't like that
Left my soul for the sugar in the body bag
I got some mochomo cake
Strawberry mousse and it killed my heartache
Just say it concisely
Neptunian beats they decide me
She sold her soul to the sandman
And if the grains in the earth
Couldn't feed her land
I'm walking through dark lands
And the angels let go of my hand
And love just seemed to be a minion
In another time
And everything I ever did
Came back to haunt me
And everything I ever was
Became sand
By the time I was floating
Slowly floating
The angels sang ...

Burnt out, restless and tired
Slipped a gear, clutch plate burning red
Kick-start a revolution
By kicking sand in the eyes of the fake
Sat here dreaming to the scream of the siren
Taking me of to the hospital
I gotta get it gotta get it all even
And re-shape this mould that is
Me
Absent without leave
Without interest or understanding
Lets say, I wont be present for the time being
Living in a reoccurring nightmare
Another day of filament daylight
Pray for our salvation
As our souls are torn apart
Woke up screaming to the sound of the siren
Taking me off to the hospital
Now I get it, now I get it all even
If I cant re-shape this mould thats
Me
Absent without leave
Without interest or understanding
Lets say, I wont be present for the time being
Without interest or understanding
Leave my body and enter my mind
Me
Absent without leave
Without interest or understanding
Lets say, I wont be present for the time being
Without interest or understanding
Never assuming what it takes
To leave my body and enter my mind

when she comes around
she brings sunlight to a cloudy day
when i kissed her lips
she put a smile right on my face
ive been shot by cupid
got me feelin stupid
could it be ive fallen for this girl
my mind running crazy
heart beat different lately
I never felt this way before
these are symptoms of love love
I don't need a doctor
don't need a prescription
cuz by the description
these are symptoms of love love
if there was a way
I could get this girl to understand
Id cut to the chase
and let her know jus how I feel cuz
ive been shot by cupid
got me feelin stupid
could it be ive fallen for this girl
my mind running crazy
heart beat different lately
I never felt this way before
these are symptoms of love love
I don't need a doctor
don't need a prescription
cuz by the description
these are symptoms of love love

I've waited here
Between the light and the rain
Hiding in the cracks in the walls
Trying to break my fall
As I lose you again
And you're gone
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here again
I've waited here
Holding on to pieces of the past
But nothing, nothing makes sense any more
I can't seem to push us back together
I thought we'd be forever
But you're gone
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here again
As though love never came
I guess love always leaves me here
You leave me here
But I run from the shadow
The darkness always hides behinds the sun
I'm still holding on
In silence and the emptiness
The darkness seems to leave when you're gone
But I'm still holding on
But I'm still holding on
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here again
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here
You leave me here

I want more than you can give
I'm so cold with every kiss
I can cope with a love like this
I let go, but I cling
To a love I've never seen
Give me faith
It feels like I just opened the doors
I steal, all thought
Nothing ever comes for free
This world is watching me
This world is watching me
It drains the blood from me
It pains my skin so deep
Now all that's left is all I need
This world is watching me
This world is watching me

She said Hello mister Pleased to meet ya
I wanna hold her I wanna kiss her
She smelled of daisies She smelled of daisies
She drive me crazy She drive me crazy
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane

RPT Verse 1

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this auch a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time... on your own
Do you need some time... all alone
Everybody needs some time... on their own
Don't you know you need some time... all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time... on my own
Sometimes I need some time... all alone
Everybody needs some time... on their own
Don't you know you need some time... all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Should I stay
go away
felling right
evening light
shines on my head
you are gone
said never dare
to find
here tonight on my own
no-one there
you are gone
all alone
try to find
without your help
a guiding hand
I still ask myself
is this love
this hate
I'm feeling
I was dead
would you weep
remember now
earthly world
place unsanctified it is
Done no harm
remember now
earthly world
wail for what I believe
and believe what I know
me, a coward
Let undress
those memories
forget the place
where found the doubts
wonder why
guiding light
me a coward
you liar
I still ask myself...

Throwing sparks at my frozen angel
Gathering the words to coax the fire to start
Throwing sparks at my frozen angel
Words to melt the ice around your pretty heart
Turn the ice to water, the water into flood
The flood becomes a river, a river of pure love
Love comes into delta, nourishing the sea
Sea goes out to ocean
Ocean endlessly
Throwing sparks at my frozen angel
Gathering the words to coax the fire to start
Turn the ice to water, the water into flood
The flood becomes a river, a river of pure love
Love comes into delta, nourishing the sea
Sea goes out to ocean
Ocean endlessly
The second before you walk into the room
I had no thoughts of love whatsoever
Love was not on my mind
Nothing but my life,
My life was all settled in,
It was just the way it needed to be
And I fell upon you
Like something out of the blue
It was out of the blue, I didn't know
I didn't see it coming
But it came upon me
And it held a hold on me
Took a hold on me
And I could not help but believe
I have faith in this thing
I have one chance in my life and I must take it
And I've got to give it to you and I will not let it go
I will not let it go
It's the only thing I can believe in.
Oh, I can believe in.

So they rode the sea,
It went on and on
They were years away
Though it seemed so long
But the captain never told them what he knew
As the poor ship laboured on through the endless blue.
Oh the storm was strong
And the ship was so frail
But they stumbled on
Raising broken sails,
And they held the heavy sky on their open hands
And they dreamed of when their poor feet would touch the land.
Baby, we're going round in circles!
Where is this place we're going to?
Does anybody know we're out here on the waves?
And are any of our signals coming through?
We're going 'round in circles.
We have no single point of view.
And like the clouds that turn to every passing wind,
We turn to any signal that comes through.
At the edge of the sea
Were the signs of the dove -
But the wrong way out
And the wrong way up.
We pushed the empty frame of reason out the cabin door,
No we won't be needing reason anymore.
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah.

Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, they don't like you
Verse 1:
Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other
Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Verse 2:
Hard drugs won't do
You're just behaving like they want you to (yeah)
Arrogance is much different from ignorance
And I know you feel the same way too
Many live this life without having a clue
No reason why they are so sad and blue
Places to go so much things to do
Not a moment to reflect on the cycle of life (yeah)
A who free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you
It hard, it hard, it hard (yeah)
Mek them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (oh god)
We waan go home
Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you
Repeat Verse 1
A who free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you

It's just one of those hazy memories
I was in the mood for loving
And later that night when I fell asleep
I kept thinking of it
I saw her in the mirror
Thought I could get near enough to whisper
It's just one of those types of memories
I could barely miss her
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away (carried away)
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away
Because I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
A smoky atmosphere
I had nothing to fear
The night was young
A message loud and clear
She spoke into my ear
My heart was stung
So I looked to the left, looked to the right
Only one girl was outta sight
And I wanted her
It's just one of those types of memories
And I'm still thinking of her
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away (carried away)
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away
Because I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
And the sparks are flying, it's no wonder why
And the lights are shining bright enough
They're almost blinding my eye
I feel like my fate and your fate are combined
On the floor tonight
'Cause no one escapes from lust
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
Because, I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you

I am the lowest of the low
It's hell being enlightened
You've got to live with what you know
Worst case scenario
Always fighting with my mind
Always kicking down to compromise
My grip is gone, the past is black
It's been done before, and I like where I'm at
I am the lowest of the low
It's hell being enlightened
You've got to live with what you know
Worst case scenario
Higher, high, high
You've got to come down

You send me just colors
I'm waiting don't hold back
Trees bow to the wind and
I'm falling inside you
Slide in feel the future
Rushing slowly
Right now
So close I could touch it
I'm dreaming don't wake up
Slide in feel the future
Rushing slowly
Light now
Nothing makes me feel like
Show me real love
Right now

Ruby always waits a while before she stays
Never looking back till he's miles away
Keeps her reputation like a stone
She's not really tired, she's just overgrown
[Chorus]
She says, hey, I could be wrong,
But at least I'm breathing!
Hey, we could go anywhere but down.
She says, Hey, let me be you
And I'll fall down screaming!
Everything's a miracle when you've got your face in the ground
Ruby never says what side she's on
She lives in the shade of unfinished songs
She has got a photographic soul
Everyone she meets in a fractured hole
[Chorus]
Ruby likes the sound of people's clothes
No one ever knows when she'll go
She's got reservations with the ghost
She's not looking back
She's just growing old
[Chorus]
Ruby always waits a while before she stays
Never looking back till he's miles away
Keeps her reputation like a stone
She's not really tired, she's just overgrown

When the lights go down in your town,
And the band begins to play,
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say
When the lights go down in your town,
And the band begins to play,
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say
When the lights go down in your town,
And the band begins to play,
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say
When the lights go down in your town,
And the band begins to play,
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say
Everybody calls him wonderkid
Everybody calls him wonderkid
Everybody calls him wonderkid
Everybody calls him wonderkid
Everybody calls him wonderkid
He gets kicks from guitar licks
When the lights go down in your town,
And the band begins to play,
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say
When the lights go down in your town,
And the band begins to play,
You can feel the energy coming
From the people as they say

Midnight coming
I'm farther away than I used to be
Running down these city streets
Where the future beckons to me
We've got nothing
Written down in our history
Moving on two hearts agree
But you can call on me
On the horizon line
I see the form reflecting in time
In the blue-green light
There's a movement all around me
I feel there's something
Coming on this sudden breeze
Colors changing on the leaves
The scene's got nothing on me
Drift from the softness
Drawing out this strange disease
Moving towards the deeper seas
The future's calling to me

Have you ever seen the fields of love?
Have you ever felt the seeds of love?
Have you ever seen the fields of love?
Have you ever felt the seeds of love?
The fields of love
The fields of love
The fields of love
The fields of love
Have you ever seen the fields of love?
Have you ever felt the seeds of love?
Have you ever seen the fields of love?
Have you ever felt the seeds of love?
The fields of love
The fields of love

I keep my cool for one more day
Laugh along enough to keep getting paid
I'm losing my hold on hope
Is this your idea of a joke?
I just keep talking to myself
Wondering to myself
What have I done, what have I done?
Under the moon that follows me
Someone watches me,
Under the sun, under the gun
I've been down but never out
I can't see what you're so happy about
Losing is not what I wanted
All is not lost, but now it's haunted
I just keep talking to myself
Wondering to myself
What have I done, what have I done?
Under the moon that follows me
Someone watches me,
Under the sun, under the gun
I just keep talking to myself
Wondering to myself
What have I done, what have I done?
Under the moon that follows me
Someone watches me,
Under the sun, under the gun
I just keep talking to myself
Wondering to myself
What have I done, what have I done?
Under the moon that follows me
Someone watches me,
Under the sun, I'm under the gun

You ask me what I did today but I'm not gonna say
I was watching something in a really really really big way
I'm asking you questions better tell me
something good
Fifteen minutes ain't fast enough
Culture vulture
Smashing things on the weekends to get my kind of thrills
Smashing things on the weekends to get my thrills
I use sensation to get my stimulation
My stimulation it spells sensation
I need sensation to get my stimulation
My stimulation is spells sensation
More, more, more of what?
I need sensation to get my stimulation
My stimulation is spells sensation
More more, more of what?
Another necessity left here on the shelf
Do it fast or just tag along
Another necessity left here on the shelf
Do it fast or just tag along
In the evening when I come home
You ask me what? What did I say?
Well, I'm not gonna say
Anno dommini but add another d
Attention deficiency, that's me
I'm the disease of the century but I don't care
Anno dommini but add another d
Attention deficiency, that's me
I'm the disease of the century but I don't care
Stop flicking my channels with your remote control
Stop flicking my channels with your remote control
Stop flicking my channels with your remote control
Defining the world through regurgitated, updated, mediocre, mainstream
media information
that smacks of sensation
You ask me what I did today but I'm not gonna say
I was watching something in a really really really big way
Culture vulture
Hey you culture vultures
You ask me what I did today but I'm not gonna say
I was watching something in a really really really big way

Mama told Mary not to go downtown
Too many lovely boys hanging around
Mary didn't listen, she went anyway
There she met a boy who took her away
Soldier, soldier, don't look down
(Soldier, soldier, don't look down)

Sixth months later all was gone
We had a little son, we are having fun
Mama, don't think twice
Soldiers can be nice
Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town

A lie, whatever happens you will know
It's everything you're taught it was
Thought it was, fall along the line
A lie, if nothing happened then it worked
They tell me it's a healthy sign
A healthy sign, a healthy sign alive
As soon as backs were turned
The cracks return, return, return
Say you're asking them again yourself
As soon as backs were turned
The cracks return, return, return
Saves you asking them again yourself

Somewhere in South End when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge
Why can't we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead
(Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead)
Somebody said that I'm a fuckin' slum
Don't know that I belong
Maybe you're fucking dumb
Maybe I'm just a bum
Maybe you're fucking scum
Don't you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time
Pineapples are in my head
(When you were fun)
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead
(You made me run)
Pineapples are in my head
(To the seafront)
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead
(She took the plunge)
5000 footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms around my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won't forget how you looked at me then
I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times when we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don't I say it then?
I want you all the time
Why can't we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead
(Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead
(Got nobody 'cause I'm brain dead)

I'm falling down, I'm turned around
I'm falling down, I'm turned around
I'm falling down, I'm turned around
No matter what I do I hit the ground
I don't want to do this anymore
But everyone is coming back for more
With my love, they want to play
I could stop them but I look away
What have I done? I should have known
If I hide something I'll be alone
But now I know how to be strong
I have to find a place where I belong
And take a plane, maybe to Spain
I will never be betrayed again
I'm falling down, I'm turned around
But everyone is coming back for more
With my love, they want to play
I could stop them but I look away
What have I done? I should have known
If I hide something I'll be alone
But now I know how to be strong
I have to find a place where I belong
And take a plane, maybe to Spain
I will never be betrayed again
I'm falling down, I'm turned around
But everyone is coming back for more

Good evening
This is the voice of Enigma
In the next hour
We will take you with us
Into another world,
Into the world of music, spirit and meditation
Turn off the light,
Take a deep breath
And relax
Start to move slowly,
Very slowly
Let the rhythm be your
Guiding light

There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home
'Cause, I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed it's knees
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
I held on as tightly as you held onto me
I held on as tightly as you held onto me
And, I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust

I want to love you
Like I've never loved you tonight
If it's alright
I want to tell you things I've never said
In my life
I'm gonna hold you when the sun refuses to shine, yeah
I want to show you that I'll always be by your side, oh
[Chorus:]
When you call my name
And you need me there
Girl you know
That I will be waiting for you
When you close your eyes
And you see me there
Don't you know
That I will be waiting
I want to kiss you like
I'll never kiss you again
If it's okay
I can't imagine loving any other this way, whoa
[Chorus x2]
When you call my name
And you need me there
Girl you know
That I will be waiting for you
When you close your eyes
And you see me there
Don't you know
That I will be waiting
So what ya want to do?
I want to be with you
I know you like my style
So why don't you stay a while
And when you want me to
I'll wait for you
[Chorus x2]
When you call my name
And you need me there
Girl you know
That I will be waiting for you
When you close your eyes
And you see me there
Don't you know
That I will be waiting
You'll call my name and I'll be there
You'll call my name babe
Oh ooh oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Call my name yeah

In the end
There was no-one to see
No helicopters in the sky the next day
Or the day after
No-one was searching
'Cause no-one knew he was missing
He followed me home
Can I keep home
He followed me
A pretty boy like you
With hands that could break me in two
But don't
Breaking away gently
Come on
Let's go
He's still warm
And close to me
I can see tears in his eyes
And I feel better
He followed me home
Can I keep home
He followed me
In the end
There was no-one to see
No helicopters in the sky the next day
Or the day after
No-one was searching
'Cause no-one knew he was missing

Late at night, I'll run through streets and empty corridors.
I'll find my counterpoint, inside a red room locked behind a door.
I keep holding my head up, holding it up.
Holding my head up, holding it up.
But you just don't come back, around.
It seems to me that we will never be.
And tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong today.
Just tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong today.
Late at night, I'll run through the streets and empty corridors.
I'll find my counterpoint, inside a red room locked behind a door. Behind a door.
And someone tell me,
Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong today.
Just tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong today.
Oh, everything I want.
Oh, everything I'm not.
Is suddenly gone.
And tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong today.
And someone tell me, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong today, today, today, today.
Today
Today
Today
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing
And someone tell me,
Nothing

Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
But we know that we're brave enough to be
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me
Break through from the other side
And lead me to paradise
Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
And every time I close my eyes we disappear
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

[Intro]
Yo, them man know I'm not here to play the game
I'm here to change it
And with change, come questions
Watch this
[Verse 1]
I hear man have been asking man about me
Questioning my whole team
Asking man if the tings got bodies - don't question what you can't see
Please don't touch what you can't reach
And miss me with the bad boy speech
Man came from selling OZ's, to running a business - And now I keep the receipts
I was a bad boy back in 03'
Locked up back in 06'
I robbed man but I never lost sleep
And now I got more legal money that I got bricks
I've had more vehicles than you've had chicks
They said I made my money on YouTube
But I've done more robberies than vids'
And I've took more drug money than I took pics
[Hook]
But I think they forgot that when I went clear
They must forgot that when I went clear
I kinda forgot that when I went clear
But then I just stopped, and then I look back
And still nobody got near
[Verse 2]
I come from the bottom where there's nothing but mud
Turned OZ's into boxes of bud
Turns out water is thicker than blood
So I'm talking to B'Loke about the hood
Told him I'll lick man down if I could
But he told me I made way too much money this year to be chatting like a reckless thug
I'm chatting like I don't live good
Like I have to address these scruffs
I don't care if there's been a drought in the bits - round here there's been a flood
I told Darkee to go get a crib - forget the roads for a minute and lets live
Then I thought, wait
What about when my man gets out?
Fuck it, It is what it is
[Verse 3]
I'll make it bang until it go click, click, click
I'll make it bang until it go click, click, click
Nobody's banging on my clique, clique, clique
But then I went clear
Never looked back
Best thing that I ever did, that I ever did
[Verse 4]
Can a real nigga respect a snitch? - No
Can a fake nigga try it with [?]? - No
Can you have family in the police force and still represent the bits? - No
Them man are washed up now its a minor
Their on a swegway, I'm on a night rider
They can keep coming and coming and coming
But how can a meerkat fight with a tiger?
They need me cause they know i'm in a different league, different league, different league
Last year man made about 100G's
I let them make music based on me
I'm like a sawn-off shotgun, letting off ball bearings
Them man are letting off a BB
I'm on your radio and your explorer page and your mind and more time on your TV
[Hook]
They don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
Nope they don't like that a brudda went clear, brudda went clear, brudda went clear
But then I just stopped, and then I look back
And still nobody got near, nobody got near
[Verse 5]
I rolled up and told her she's better without me
Took of my trainer
Took of my tracksuit
I left the house and jumped in my Audi
Next time I seen her was on Facebook, with her holding her boyfriends hand so proudly
But she's constantly turning the radio down when the radio is talking about me
[Verse 6]
Love is a funny thing when they love you, but you don't love them
I don't need their adult problems
I tell a lie
I got one I love, the rest I don't want
The funny thing i just like knowing that I could have got them
I told her I'll settle down
But not right now, cause I'm not here too often
[Hook]
But I think she forgets that when I'm not here, when I'm not here, when I'm not here
I think she forgets that when I'm not here, when I'm not here, when I'm not here
I think she forgets that when I went clear, when I went clear, when I went clear
That was the plan
And I won't stop till I'm a legend out here, legend out here

Every little thing you do
Makes me smile
And if I had my way, baby
I'd drive you up the wall
I'd take you through the pages
One by one
I don't want to get too serious
I just like having fun
Yeah, yeah
I just like having fun
Oh, sugar
I'm living the single, single, single
Life
The single, single, single
Life
Now I don't want anybody
To get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothing to hide
I want the world to see
Just like a car I'll drive you
Out of your mind
It's always the first step
In us having a good time
Oh, oh, oh, sugar
I'm living the single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single
Life
Single guys clap your hands
Yeah
Oh, sugar
Single ladies clap your hands
Feels so good
And it feels so good
Feels so good
I'm living the single, single, single
Life (Oh, sugar)
Single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single

Oh, I wish you could be here
To see the flowers, they only smell so sweet
Since you've been gone,
And all the day you left they bloom for hours
To compensate me for what you've had done
Oh, and I don't wish misfortune on your head
For I'm ask much to blame on, only stay
So wherever you'll may be and in which ever land you
Roam
I hope there always be here a place you can call, oh
And I wish you could be here to see the baby
She is growing and she is walking in all its own
And I'm a working woman now, and maby
The child don't need a daddy much at all
And yes I've got a front door and a back
Oh but runs more than the roof above your head
So wherever you'll may be and in which ever land you
Roam
I hope there always be here a place you can call, oh
Home from home
And whoever you love
And how many good friends you know,
I hope you'll always have a place you can call
Oh, Home from home
Home from home

Under my soul, I hide, chasing emotions
Can't you see?
If I let it go, will we reveal a sign of devotion?
All you feel
Sometimes there's a moment
Sometimes we don't see
Now we stand to frighten, scared to believe
Now I wait for you
Till you wake me, from my sleep
And I'll wait for you
Let my voice be, yours to keep
The touch of your hand, on me
A night everlasting, comes too deep
Don't make me wait, for what I need
This passion is burning, deep in me
Sometimes there's a moment
Sometimes we don't see
Now we stand to frighten, scared to believe
Now I wait for you
Till you wake me, from my sleep
And I'll wait for you
Let my voice be, yours to keep
Now I wait for you
Till you wake me, from my sleep
And I'll wait for you
Let my voice be, yours to keep
Wait for you
Wait for you

In the sky and in the eye and
In the sky and in the eye and..
If you want to touch the sky
Just put a window in your eye
See the sun and
See the rain
See the window
See the pain
See the sun and
See the rain
See the birds eye
See the brain
Ancient cities
Rise again
See microscopic
See world view
See the future
Leaking through
See the person
Who once was you
See the seashore and
See the sand
See the windows
In your hand
See the Lie.
Gold is the sky
In concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power surge
Power will rise
Through the windows and
Through the skies
Misrule is kind.
See the sky and
See the eye and
See the sky and
In your hand in the sky
And in your eye
See the sky in your hand
See the sky and understand
Gold is the sky
In concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power will rise
Power will fly
Through the window
Through your eye
Gold is the sky
Riches, treasures, riches
Richard's treasures
Riches, treasures, riches
Gold is the sky
In concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power will rise
Power will fly
Through the window and
Through your eye
Gold is the sky.

I've forgotten how to write
And I'm giving up on speech
I can't remember how I look
Or the day of the week
Your love is a distant memory
Along with most of my family
I'd get on my knees but I'm not allowed
Even though I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how to walk
And I can't use my hands at all
I'd cross my heart and hope to die
But I'm heading for a fall
Just let me go for my sanity
Put me out of my misery
I'd get on my knees, but I'm not allowed
Even though I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
Decay, decay, decay, decay
Your love is a distant memory
Along with most of my family
I'd get on my knees but I'm not allowed
Even though I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how
Put me out of my misery
Let me go for my sanity

You sure do got a pretty mouth
Why don't you drop my pants, I'll make you squeal like a pig
Feet in the water is not cold enough, you're not woman enough
Inside your daughter is not warm enough, and you're not woman enough, no
Don't compromise what's gold
For the soul you never sold
For the soul you never sold, no
So I follow you down this road
Well you try but you can't let go
So hold on to years ago
Cold as a lover, don't you want to stay?
Breath from another, and I'll have my way
Inside your daughter
You can never hold what you can't let go
'Cause he wants it so
She'd sell her own mother
Just to make a dime before closing time
When he tells her so
Don't compromise what's gold
For the soul you never sold
For the soul you never sold, no
So I follow you down this road
Will you drive? well you can't let go
So long, two years ago
She said she wanted me to hit it
But I said I wasn't with it
Eyes red thighs spread better come get it
While it's hot the goods I got nevermind my bad credit
Told me how she was soaking wet and I'm the one who wet it
Can't lie I sweat it, but I knew that if I ran through that
It's up the creek I'm headed
Body was there without nor sight nor vision still embedded
But I knew for fucking sure that in the morning I'd regret it
Had to debt it I jetted
He got me hooked 'til I was shooking in the middle of the game
Teary eyes, touch my thighs, future high you'll be my game
Could have kept it but I left it embedded instead of it dissecting me
Free spirit I feared it but steer it to clear it the stress in me
Possessing me the chemistry mother want me in the ministry
Where misery influenced me corruption claiming custody
And I knew this time that I had to feel the pain
It was needed so I'll see what cause deception in this game
Don't compromise what's gold
For the soul you never sold
For the soul you never sold, no
So I follow you down this road
Will you drive? well you can't let go
So hold on to years ago
I'll try to understand
When you're down on your knees in front of a man
I'll try to understand

(the road to graceland)
Darshan
Two birds
One stone
One chance
Is thrown
Don't make
Mistakes
Two thieves
Strung up
One knife
One cut
Two doors
One shut
One light
One way
One road
To take
We stand
And wait
From cool
To warm

Once upon a time science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry fields till they couldn't eat no more
But the potions that we made touched the creatures down below, oh
And they grew up in the way that we'd never seen before
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
They were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night
For a hundred miles or more you can hear the people cry
But there's nothin' you can do even God is on their side
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
How can I explain, things are different today
Darkness all around and nobody makes a sound
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care
Supernature, better watch out
Look at you now, better watch out
Look at you now, supernature
Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay
Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now
Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now
Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
(Supernature)
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay
Maybe nature has a plan to control the ways of man
He must start from scratch again many battles he must win
Till he earns his place on earth like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end, now that all depends on you
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature

Take my word for it, this never should have happened
What in the world do you think got into me
We fire at will and as we watch the pieces shatter
We find were closer than we've ever been
She calls my name and I come running
I have lost the voice I listened too
And in the blindness as my world stops turning
There's a sadness like I never knew but I still see the shining of things
As the morning breaks, it hardly seems to matter
I hear a shallowness in everything I say
We've played the night out in all too familiar fashion
To wear the heartache through another day
She calls my name and I come running
I have lost the voice I listened too
And there's a stillness now, the rain's stopped falling
There's a sadness like I never knew but I see the shining of things

With you I feel I'm the meek leading the blind
With you I feel I'm just spending wasting time

You won't find love

If you can meet me in the middle
Maybe we can compromise a little
'Cause our love is worth it all,
It's bigger than the little things we fight

feel like a death star - abused by control -
Grey - without any emotions
Pull me into the right direction - and I will kill you!
I capture a thousand lives
I wait for instructions - I can't wait! I can't wait
Blow me away!
I only destroy to demonstrate my powers
Born to observe the confusion
Your fear is my freedom - and I eat you alive...
My mistakes are too complex for you to understand!
For you to fight...
My mistakes... my mistakes...
I bring the light! I bring the light! I bring the light!
No one survived my shadow - ever!
When I need you - I start protecting you...
My love gives you life
A death star
I am your death star... I am your death star...
And you can't wait to blow me away!
Blow me away!
You can't wait - you can't wait - you can't wait
To blow me away... to blow me away...
A death star...

Come Hell or high water
You just do as you please,
Waste your time when you oughta
Be charming the birds from the trees.
A voice straight from heaven
So you like to believe
And who cares if its only
Your poor self you deceive.
You look in the mirror and what do you see?
Too much care and sceaming, too little beauties
Come Hell or High water, you never will be
A goddess or a genius, a drunker at 23
And all that you yearn for, is attention I guess
Come Hell or high water you deserve nothing less.
Come Hell or high water you will stray off the rails
and I won't try to change you for god knows I would fail
and its to the angels that each day you pray
Come hell or high water I know you will meet them someday

You love him
You want to make him happy
He loves you
He wants to humiliate you
He's a bastard!
You should leave him!
Paranoid manipulator
To hell with him!
He's dragging you
Along
On a leash called love
He controls you
You should do him in
Before he gets to you
Watch out girl!
He's dragging you
Along
On a leash called love.
You have torn me
Inside out
Nothing but
A nervous wreck
You have got me
On that leash,
You whip me with
A leash called love
I've lost all sense of direction!
You make me a victim
To your friends' nasty remarks
And I don't know how
I survive!
Trying to tell (? ? )
You have to pretend like
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
I can no longer
Distinguish from
Right or wrong,
Sane, insane...
You're taking your chances
Be through with you (? )
Whip me back,
Back and forth.
Paranoid.
Leash called love..

Only in days, they get together
They're talking volumes, and drink some coffee
Clipped out, clear and bright
They pour out all, their own true mankind
There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
All he says causes scandal
I've heard it said that he's the original of the vandal
He steals your words
Clears our mind
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way, like accepting
There's no way, that's damned sure
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
Hopelessly untrue
Yeah, yeah
There's no truth
There's no lies
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way, you can move me
There's no way, for sure
There's no truth
There's no lies

Clad in cloak
A secretive nun
Bearing the old ones bastard son
Varucose phallos
Obsessed and poised her
Cast a veil of dusk upon the cloister
Prime mover
Maternal slave
With child of her grave
Mother
Filth in her womb
Father
Waiting in tomb
Selected heir
Machinery insect
Bloodline of the dark architect
Toxic blood
Of not known birth
Antichrist will walk the earth

Look into the others eyes,
Many frustrations
Read between the lines,
No words, just vibrations
Don't ignore hidden desires
Pay attention, you're playing with fire
Silence must be heard, noise should be observed
The time has come to learn, that silence...
Silence must be heard
Or diamonds will burn, friendly cards will turn
Cause silence has the right to be heard
People talk too much for what they have to say
Words without a meaning, just fading away
Silence must be heard, noise should be observed
The time has come to learn, that silence...
Silence must be heard
Or diamonds will burn, friendly cards will turn
Cause silence has the right to be heard

Over dale and over hills
I'll take you through the cotton mills
To the ginnels where we played
And where are friendships all were made
Still they came and tore them down
And now we live in Anytown
They came and tore it down
And now this place could be Anytown
Can't forget and won't forgive
The places we've been forced to live
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But rather that than live alone
For they came and tore it down
And now we live in Anytown
They came and tore it down
And now this place could be Anytown
Rags to riches, that's a lie
For some things money just can't buy
Thicker than water blood may be
And comfort still brings misery
For they came and tore it down
And now we live in Anytown
They came and tore it down
And now this place could be Anytown
They took the heart when they ripped it down
And in its place sent Anytown
Summer in the driving rain
I can hear the Oldham train.

(Translation:
Look, women working by day and late at night,
They sing of bright days that were,
A long way back and forth forever.)

Wrap around, open arms
And let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
And we ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
We ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
Just let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
Times ain't that bad
Of course you're making me mad
Driving me crazy, oh, no no
I wouldn't change it, baby, don't go
I guess we were drinking for the hell of it
And yelling shit
I don't even know the melody
No energy, we've been dancing for the whole night
But with you , I guess it's alright
We be treating every day like it's a holiday
My momma say, work hard, but I gotta play
'Cause with you, I know it's alright
Let's just do this here all night
Wrap around, open arms
And let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
And we ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
We ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
Just let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
Times ain't that bad
Of course you're making me mad
Driving me crazy, oh, no no
I wouldn't change it, baby, don't go
Why you always on your phone?
I can't get with it
I'm yelling shit
Oh, now you say she a relative?
I bet she is
We say nothing for the whole night
I can't do this here all night
Gave you something no other girl could ever give
Me and you against the world, we on some rebel shit
Oh with you I know I'll be alright
But I can't do this all night
Wrap around, open arms
And let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
And we ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
We ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
Just let me feel your love

He beats the door and breaks his watch
Raids the fridge and eats the lot
No room for silence, pause of thought
To ease the hurt inside him
They placed a barrel at his head
Raging blind and rising
Cursed by saints and all the rest
He can`t stand up for trying
Shot through with anger and desire
A mouth to feed, a room for hire
He drinks 'goodbyes', the bottle dry
Brutalised but smiling
Causing casualties by the hour
Outweighed by stars
And Firepower
Causing casualties by the hour
Waylayed by stars
And Firepower
He beats the door and breaks the lock
Afraid to sleep he won`t let up
No room for silence, pause or thought
To ease the hurt inside him

Cut like a picture from a paper safely tucked away
Well thats how my heart is for you
You keep yours guarded like a palace hiding all its jewels
Thats just how hard it is for you
You found somebody yeah ok well I found somebody too
No need to put on such a show
If we should fight it out Im sure we'll take it to the other
No one should ever have to know
Its not over til its over
Oh no but we'll try
To make it right for just one night
We tried
Its seemed a good idea the first time that we had each other
Why don't we just leave it at that
I know that nothing lasts forever this could change any minute
And we might never change it back
We keep on running til tomorrow closer to the future
Sometimes it seems so far away
I stared at pictures from a faded to a weaker image
You're pushing on Im pushing play
Its not over til its over
Oh no but we'll try
To make it right for just one night
We tried

Oh, do you know who your fuckin with?
My capabilities are far from the usual
So back the fuck up and stay in line
Unparalleled, I'm one of a kind
I am looking forward to burying you
Underneath my tracks
My war path will bring you to your knees
Bring you too your knees, so
Grab your guns and grab your knives
I am stronger than these lies
Ready to take your aim so just fire away, just fire away
Grab your guns and grab your knives
I am stronger than these lies
Ready to take your aim so just fire away, just fire away
I hope you brought your ammunition
You can try to gun me down
Surrender!
When I release the wrath of this
Catastrophe, my masterpiece
Disaster leash, cut loose to bash the teeth
Of the belief, you'll be deceased
To say the least.
Bring your guns
Cause you can't take me down.
Bring your guns
Cause you can't take me down
Ha ha ha!
Grab your guns and grab your knives
I am stronger than these lies
Ready to take your aim so just fire away, just fire away
Grab your guns and grab your knives
I am stronger than these lies
Ready to take your aim so just fire away, just fire away
I bring it down, down, down
You know what I do
I don't even have to bring it to ya
All I gotta to set it down
All you want to do fuck around
Well fuck around and get
Fucked upside down!
Get fucked upside down!
Oh my god, hahaha let's turn it up!
Yeah!
Fire the cannons
I'll aim at aim at your throat
I am the invasion force
I'm coming for the top
You can't stop me now
Grab your guns and grab your knives
I am stronger than these lies
Ready to take your aim, fire away!
Grab your guns and grab your knives
I am stronger than these lies
Ready to take your aim and fire away, and fire away

It always makes me wonder why why
Even try at all
Working to uncover your love
How long has it been seen I've seen you last
I left a message on your phone
How many sleepless nights have passed
Without you, without you
I take it back, but you don't want that I give up this waiting (?)
I take it back, cause its so easy to forget what I already know
Maybe you were right
But i just dont feel like
Giving up on you tonight
I take it back, but you don't want that i give up this waiting (?)
I take it back, cause its so easy to forget what I already know
I take it back, but you don't want that I give up this waiting (?)
I take it back, cause its so easy to forget what I already know

[Chorus]
You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
So bang your head against the wall
But no one wants to see you fall down
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
Put your hands over your eyes
And stumble your way through the night
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
[Chorus]
So shout until your hear no more
But don't you ever ask yourself why
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
Dig yourself a bottomless hole
But don't you ever lose that light
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Repetition to work
[Chorus]
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Repetiton to work

You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is
It's typical of you
Standing out in the pouring rain
It's typical of you
Looking like you do
And the day I'll catch your eye
Could another chance come by
I should really know by now
Would I ask you anyhow?
It's typical of you
Looking like you do
It's typical of you
Love me like you do
You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is
It's typical of you
Standing out in the pouring rain
It's typical of you
Looking so, so good
There's moonlight and it's warm outside
Just a little breeze come by
I'm afraid to trip and fall
Do you really exist at all?
It's typical of you
Looking like you do
So typical of you
Love me like you do
You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is
It's all there is
And it's all there is
It's all there is
So...
All there is
So...
All there is

Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new
It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better
Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new
It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better

Everybody hearin' the sound of my voice raise your hands and believe in love,
If you believe,
I need you to believe in love right now!
Raise your hands up high,
Feel the love generation
Cover the world, with love
Come on!
Listen children,
I wanna tell ya somethin' real quick and real fast,
I need you to understand that sometimes
We're separated because of the color of our skin,
Or were we grew up from,
But I want you to understand somethin',
That we need to embrace the word love
Because love can bring all generations of people together,
All colors and creeds together,
In peace and harmony,
I want you to feel the love generation!
I need all my believers that are listening to what I'm saying right now,
If it had not been for love,
Everything that is in this world would not exist,
We need to understand right now that because of love,
Things happen in a way where people just don't seem to understand,
Love is something that does not, does not compromise itself,
Love is something that we'll sacrifice for everything that goes on,
If you believe!
If you believe,
I need you to believe in Love right now,
Raise your hands up high,
Feel the love generation
Cover the world with love, come on!

(Yeah)
(Love can save us all)
It's so beautiful
Though the seasons have changed
Is it something I said
Nothing left to be said
Its a beautiful day
Although the seasons have changed
There's nothing left to be said
Beautiful Beautiful day
Although the seasons have changed
Bitter sweet or faded
Breaking beautiful ways
And yet the truth is unchanged
No one left to fault or blame
I feel the beautiful days will cry the tears of my pain
If you're breathing, your heart can break
Love can kill you
Or love can save us all
Love can kill you
Or love can save us all
Its a beautiful day
Although the seasons have changed
There's nothing left to be said
Such a beautiful day
And yet the seasons have changed
Is it something i said
Breaking beautiful ways
And though the truth is unchanged
theres nothing left to be said
I feel the beautiful days will cry the tears of my pain
If you're breathing, your heart can break
Love can kill you
Or love can save us all
(Love can kill you
or Love can save us all)
Love can kill you
Or love can save us all
Love can you
Or love can save us all
Love can save us all
Love can save us all
Yeah
Love can kill you
Or love can save us all
..Or love can save us all
..Or love can save us all
..Yeah

Centered photo lines
Capture the sentimental waves
We all take our places
To reconcile all the faces outside the frame
Is this camouflage
Or just some dream?
To atone our sins
And watch them fall to their knees
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough
And how will I know enough?
How will I know enough
To call it to me?
'Cause I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel
The trouble that surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to know
The trouble which surrounds me
We are paralyzed
In what beckons us to bleed
Harbored in our dusty heads lie
The complete works of revolutions unseen
And harbored in our dusty heads lie
Works of revolution
Are we camouflaged
Or in some dream?
To atone our sin brigades
And watch them fall to, fall to their knees
I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel
The trouble that surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to know
The trouble which surrounds me
And where is awake enough to find some peace?
And how will I know enough?
How will I know enough to call it to me?
'Cause I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel
The trouble that surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to know
The trouble which surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to bear
The trouble that surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel
The trouble which surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to bear
The trouble that surrounds me
And I am not awake enough
I am not awake enough to feel
The trouble which surrounds me

thater planks ashamed and shaped talking fast head down
'we'll need some cash and body bags to go and run and run to go to
one wishbone for the ghosts to roll the dice
playtime sugarfree coffee breakfast holy gasps and cheek to cheek dance
we'll need some cash and body bags to go and run and run to go to'

We drive so far, to get away
Never look back, we don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, like a shooting star
Let the skyline guide us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
All lights go out and fade away
Never lose faith, leave all of your fears behind
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, with an open heart
Let the sunshine find us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now

Something's bubbling up inside your holy head
You want to leave me but you don't know how to say it
Trying to tell me other ways didn't do any good
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Something's bubbling up inside my head
I want to stay here but I don't know how
Gone, you'll be gone with all that we should be gone
In the morning, morning maybe we could get back together
But I don't know if it'd be much better
Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers
Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers
Something's tumbling down inside your holy head
I know you're hiding when you drive by with your hood on
Gone, you'll be gone with all that we should be done
In the morning, morning, morning, morning

Come all you fair and tender girls
That flourish in your prime
Beware, beware
Keep your garden fair
Let no man steal your thyme
Let no man steal your thyme.
For when your thyme it is past and gone
He'll care no more for you
And every place where your thyme was waste
Will all spread o'er with rue
Will all spread o'er with rue.
The gardener's son was standing by
Three flowers he gave to me
The pink, the blue, and the violet too
And the red, red rosy tree
And the red, red rosy tree.
But I refused the red rose bush
And gained the willow tree
That all the world may plainly see
How my love slighted me
How my love slighted me.

If you don't eat yourself
No doubt the pain will instead
You could longer life
Seen it on that land
You went south on the train
She wore plastic boots for rain
And you crawl along exhausted
No sense do you like this
Crawling
Who will I be when I'm with you again
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain
Got a song, got to sing
For life
If you don't eat yourself
No doubt the pain will instead
If you don't eat yourself
You will explode instead
Cause I love love you so
When I know you don't love me
You who laughs alone
Get wicked, did it come

Bright yellow light
This balmy night's too long
My broken record
It's always on
My yellow light's too low
My broken record
My father told me never to run
There are things coming after me
I'm all ready gone
Out through the door
Through my backyard

[LSK]
A mans life got took away in the city today, they say
But never tell how many's been born
Inform us of a top notch surgeon's mistake
But not the many lives he's saved before
Show us starving kids through expensive lenses
On a far and distant shore
Of which, when sold, could feed a good few
Hey mister rich - Why don't you help the poor
Bad news, sad news, never no good news
S'all they print and beam
Make a child believe that there ain't no love
Well hey, love lives on my street.
Love is you, love is me, love is us, love is free
Zip up your front all ya want
But there's a heart in every seed
Love is you, love is me, love is us, love is free
Zip up your front all ya want
But there's a heart in every seed
Back up from the crap and the desert of dying sons
Me I'm trying to come to terms and learn as one
Way to display the way I'm feeling, I need healing
From the floor to the ceiling,
But I'm not gonna sit n' die while time ticks by
I gotta get up, stand up, before I break up into pieces
Iron out the creases,
Find out what peace is.
[LSK slow]
Love is you [Repeat: x 2]

Our love was my womb but our bond has broken
My shield is gone, my protection is taken
I am one wound, my pulsating body
Suffering be
My heart is enormous lake, black with potion
I am blind, drowning in this ocean
My soul torn apart, my spirit is broken
Into the fabric of all he has woven
You fear my limitless emotions
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much? Devotion bent me broken
So I remained, destroyed the icon
I did it for love, I honored my feelings
You betrayed your own heart, corrupted that organ
Family was always our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned
You have nothing to give, your heart is hollow
I am drowned in sorrows
No hope in sight, of ember
Reckoning eternal pain and horrors
I am a glowing shining rocket
Returning home
As I enter the atmosphere
I burn off layer by layer

It's your head
It's your heart
Lost somewhere
Missing parts
Wedding bells second time
One more deal, one more crime
Tell us nothing, tell us lies
With elation's no surprise
Tonight they hunt for you
Tell us nothing, tell us lies
All your passion that you hide
Tonight they hunt for you
Every night, every day
Making plans for your escape
All you love you destroy
Everyone is your toy
Tell us nothing, tell us lies
With elation's no surprise
Tonight they hunt for you
Tell us nothing, tell us lies
All your passion that you hide
Tonight they hunt for you
Tell us nothing, tell us lies
With elation's no surprise
Tonight they hunt for you
Tell us nothing, tell us lies
All your passion that you hide
Tonight they hunt for you
You tell nothing too late
Lies, you tell lies
You tell nothing too late
Lies, you tell lies

Lovely
Horizontal like a quarter to three, lovely
Horizontal like a quarter to three, lovely
Horizontal like a quarter to three, lovely
Horizontal like a quarter to three, lovely
Even though it's sandy and dusty
Adjust my position on my cushion
Time is a treasure cause it's oh-so-dear
Lying here at my leisure on air
And the sun is really high in the sky
How am I supposed to 'do the dew'
When it's too hot to move
I'm woozy
I'm woozy
I'm woozy
Nobody in bed with me
I need room to be where I want to be
No need to zoom or rush
In fact, take out the bass in case we need more hush
Less percussion, a little less pushing and shoving
Take it easy, you could even get sleazy
Come around, watch a movie with the sound down
And get woozy
I'm woozy
I'm woozy
I'm woozy, yeah
I'm woozy

The word 'Hurricane' is the name given to nature's strongest storm
A hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air come in contact with one another
There is often a significant difference in temperature between the two masses
One mass is warm, while the other is cold
The warmer air rises, and the cooler air falls
Likewise, the low pressure area slides down the sides of the high pressure area
They swirl in and around one another, creating the beginnings of the storm

Come with us
And leave your Earth behind
Bright and clear
We see the light
All universes at your side!
Please lead us to other suns' warm light
Behold
They're coming back
Behold
They're coming back
They're coming back
They're coming back
They're coming back
They're coming back
Come with us...

When Jah is at the ship
We smile at the storm
Life hard and dis ya road it might be ruggy
But Jah would never send you there from you nuh ready no
Listen to his voice and hold on steady
We movin' on and on
[Chorus: x2]
After a storm there must be a calm
You shoulda never go resign
Remember seh Jah love already there before you born
His love is so pure and devine
Just keep that smile up on your face make it an easy day
Never let dem get you down cause you will make it anyway
With Jah love ina your heart I'm sure you will never go astray
And while the sunshine you got to make hay
Jah Jah a the water to my root the only truth
Me nuh go stop work and try until me reap the fruit
And as long as there is no justice man hafi go revolute
Just tell the children the truth
[Chorus: x2]
Box and kick me and threat me like a toy
Try your very best to take away me joy
Yuh nah go see me ina babylon employ
But i have know jah love from ever since i was a boy
Galong and give life a try
Stop your misery and whipe this tears out of your eyes
We see the reason in the sky
Come make we put a fire pon the peagon cause them hafi get no bligh
[Chorus: x2]
Life hard and dis ya road it might be ruggy
But Jah would never send you there from you nuh ready no
Listen to his voice and hold on steady
We movin' on and on

I just want to see your face
Doing this was a big mistake
I was told we would live forever
Now I wish I could just escape
I came back as a hungry ghost
And my body's what I miss the most
I don't wanna live forever
I just wish I could decompose
I just want to see your face
Doing this was a big mistake
I was told we would live forever
Now I wish I could just escape
I guess that we got it, can we want it?
Pay a small fee then get your fun for it
Would you come back as a good girl?
Would you follow me back to the real world?
I know that our bodies are rotting in the cold ground
Somewhere in the wasteland, never to be seen again
I think about standing in the sunshine
Walking in the garden by the river like I shoulda been
Ohh, do you think about it?
Ohh, do you wonder 'bout it?
Ohh, doesn't matter 'cuz we're gonna be here for a long time
Now what you think about that?
Ohh, do you wanna be human?
Ohh, do you wanna make love again?
Ohh, well, I guess that's just the price you're gonna have to pay
For Transparency.
I just want to see your face
Doing this was a big mistake
I was told we would live forever
Now I wish I could just escape
I came back as a hungry ghost
And my body's what I miss the most
I don't wanna live forever
I just wish I could decompose
We're gonna be here for a long time. (X15)

Stuck in a hard place on a rock
I cant face it
Staring at the party
Im looking for love
I cant find it
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
In the darkness and drizzle
At the bars, making it pop
But all you suckers will fizzle
You will fizzle
Youre missing your memories
You cant remember your name
Youve changed your tune
But youve stayed the same
Throw off your dead skin
Like a chrysalis
Metamorphosis
No use resisting this
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
I cant face it
Staring at the party
Im looking for love
I cant find it
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
In the darkness and drizzle
At the bars, making it pop
But all you suckers will fizzle
You will fizzle
Your mind is ephemeral
You cant remember the game
Youve peaked too soon
But youve stayed the same
Throw off your dead weight
From the precipice
Metamorphosis
No use resisting this
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
I cant face it
Staring at the party
Im looking for love
I cant find it
Stuck in a hard place on a rock
In the darkness and drizzle
At the bars, making it pop
But all you suckers will fizzle
You will fizzle

Watch your mouth, or I'll make you wash it out.
I will teach you to be good, Mary.
Cause after all you locked yourself, in a dream and all
The very, very special things you've seen won't mean a thing.
And all your friends wanna sail around the bend
But I won't let them take your wind, Mary.
And even still you got this far, but you're not there and all
the little things that got you here won't get you anywhere

Look them act like running a gang
Got to bring it up
This is not a game
We bring it up this is not my name
I don't want them running around them
They spit you are saying amen
Got to give it up
This is what u get
U give it up
This is what u hate
Don't come crying about it
Here comes another one
And I got my word on a tasty sound
Why you hold a gun?
Why you do like you do?
Are you having fun? No
You watch your back now man
There is a real strong smell of Armageddon
And I'm Mediterranean I'm a Yamani Arebi Israelian
I know you like to chase the million
When you going to get it done?
Once u get a million you want to get another one
And another one, and another one
Why you want to hold a gun and have control on every one?
Bla bla bla, look out
The driver is in coma
Talking and thinking got him living in denial
Look ahead we are about to crash
I'm going to do something, do something
I don't want to die
Dark and cloudy and we're about to hit a turn
Batteries running low and he is squeezing on the gas
Temperatures are about to blow
And he's heating up the place
And what are you going to do?
Who is the daily fool?
Bring him on, burn him down
Get your self a different clown
Because historically we're damned to do the same again
Get your story going somewhere where your story can
Drinking water from the gutter, sucking acid rain
A

(Distorted and repeated samples)
We keep these promises, these promises
I know where no one can reach you
No I don't mind

Welcome to me eyes, baby;
See what you see.
I feel like I'm fallin', baby;
Are you fallin' with me?
I can't help but wonder.
See'mon, baby, tell me tonight.
I got a feelin' there's somethin',
On the tip of my tongue.
Come right out an' say it now, baby,
Don't leave me hangin' on.
Please don't keep me watin',
See,mon, baby, tell me....
If you feel like I feel.
When we touch,
Does a fire build?
Down in your soul,
Burnin' out of control.
Tell me tonight.
They say life is like a river,
Time is like a wind.
Love is a sail you raise,
And ride away again.
Are you comin' with me?
See,mon, baby, tell me....
If you feel like I feel.
When we touch,
Does a fire build?
Down in your soul,
Burnin' out of control.
Tell me tonight.

You can dig that knife
Deep down inside me
Just don't say never again
It's that only thing
That stops me going crazy
I know you won't
'Cause you never do
And that's the nicest thing about you
So uncaring, so assuming
Back-stabbing, all-consuming
Don't step over my head
Don't step over my head
You can filter your poison into my sleep
But I know it's my heart
That you could never reach
I know you won't
'Cause the tools you choose
And that's the ugliest thing about you
So uncaring, so assuming
Back-stabbing, all-consuming
I've told a thousand lies through me
I've sold a thousand lies for you
Don't step over my line
Don't step over my time
Don't step over my head
'Cause I will wish you dead [Repeat x 7]

Pedaling through
The dark currents
I find
An accurate copy
A blueprint
Of the pleasure
In me
A secret code carved, a secret code carved
He offers
A handshake
Crooked
Five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched
On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry
Morsecoding signals
They pulsate and wake me up
From my hibernating
On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
This time
I'm gonna keep it to myself
This time
I'm gonna keep me all to myself
And he makes me want to hurt myself again
And he makes me want to hurt myself again

One touch away! the viruses spread!
Fuck the intellectual warheads!
I said fuck them!
All viruses spread!
[? ]
I missile the truth at you!
[? ]
I said - I missile the truth at you!
Can you hear me? (x3)
Terror worldwide!
We all unite for the last showdown!
Terror worldwide!
We all unite for the last showdown...

You've been through it all
Nothing has to change
Take it all - the pain in me
But what if that's all there is?
A-a-a-all the way and we would
A-a-a-all the way and we would
Are you all there is in my heart
It does believe that you are - just my age
Here my mind is empty
Oh nobody comes away
Here time is ending
Here I'm gonna stay
Hear my name
Doesn't anybody want to play
Hear my name
Can anybody find a way
Say my name now baby
Loud and clear
Say my name now baby
Say it so I can hear your voice
All I want to do is get next to you
All I want to do is get next to you
All I want to do is get next to you
Here my mind is empty
Oh nobody comes away
Here time is ending
Here I'm gonna stay
Hear my name
Doesn't anybody want to play
Hear my name
Can anybody find a way
Here my mind is empty
Oh nobody comes away
Here time is ending
Here I'm gonna stay
Hear my name
Doesn't anybody want to play
Hear my name
Can anybody find a way

On this momentous day
Curious seduction
The most striking thing
Changes colour and its shape
Hissing words of no safety any more
On this momentous day
Already in position
So delicate so clean
I forget to leave
And my name has long, long gone
Hey James, if you wish the race is on
Hey James, if you please the chase is on
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall the visual
On this momentous day
The story's in the background
No need to tell
I've got shadows crossing my face
As I run my hands along
On this momentous day
Seems to've cracked wide open
Leaving nothing left to dream
I hear myself scream
Is this land or more sky
Did you notice that we moved
Moved fast
Along this thin strip
Flashing
Do you think we were followed here
Follow me
'Cause there'll be no flight there'll be a killing
Hey James, if you wish the race is on
Hey James, if you please the chase is on
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall the visual
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall the visual
On this momentous day
No effort is made
No visible sign
Of any kind
That this will ever end

Are you ready for me?
Come on
Come into my house
There is no one inside
My door is opened wide, so wide
Welcome to my house
Are you satisfied, are you satisfied
Didn't I blow your mind this time?
Didn't I?
Didn't I blow your mind this time?
Didn't I?
And again and again and again
And again and again and again

Call the card
left to lay
just a path
against our future days
lay direction
read the face
understand our crooked ways
smile at this
directed plain
her eyes are cracking
in their wrinkled gaze
the light is dancing
on the tabletop
restlessness that just won't stop
now planted deeply
suggesting fate
eating sweet naivet
was it mirror
or window glass?
the subtle residue
beyond your grasp
Hang the man
by his legs let us hang the man
(repeat)

His head is not his memory.
Visions coming, one, two, three.
Trickle up, trickle down.
Wearily, we come unwound.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
In hard times, hard thrills.
Reaching for the chosen pills.
Dragnets will pull you in.
Tell you that you're deep in sin.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
In hard times, hard thrills.
Reaching for the chosen pills.
Dragnets will pull you in.
Tell you that you're deep in sin.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
Once you were a lonely playboy.
Heading for a simple joy.
Trickles up, trickles down.
Frankly, I don't give a damn.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
In hard times, hard thrills.
Reaching for the chosen pills.
Dragnets will pull you in.
Tell you that you're deep in sin.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
Her new father, where and when?
Reaching for a giddy end.
Like a girl on a rainy day.
Have the needs to keep it sane.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
Senses reaching fever pitch.
Reaching for a giddy end.
Like a girl on a rainy day.
Have the needs to keep it sane.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
His head is not his memory.
Visions coming, one, two, three.
Trickle up, trickle down.
Wearily, we come unwound.
In hard times, hard thrills.
Reaching for the chosen pills.
Dragnets will pull you in.
Tell you that you're deep in sin.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
Have the needs to keep them sane.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.
Sensoria, sensoria, sensoria, sensoria.

Im afraid to die
I think about it all the time
It wont go away
It haunts me
I cant get it off my mind
What can I do?
Its just there
Thats why I was so quick to notice
Mr. Grey add in the tabloid I was reading aloud
The headline hit home
Fear Of Death, it said
Youre disappointed, I can tell
At some level, everyone fears death
I fear it right up front
I dont know how or why it happens
But I cant be the only one
No I dont wanna leave you
And I dont wanna deceive you
I am all yours
And I never I never intended
For it all to be ended
I appalled, stalled and offended
Now Im all yours
And forever and ever and ever
And forever and evermore
I do wanna die first
But that doesnt mean Im not afraid
Im terribly afraid
Im afraid all the time
What if death is nothing but sound
Electrical noise, niform, white
Sometimes it sweeps over me
Sometimes it insinuates itself into my mind little by little
I try not to talk to it
Not now, Death...

My my my my
Pink, yellow, blue
Sealed it in a bag
And sold it back to you
Put it on a shelf
Filed it under p
It's a universal pussy
No longer me
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
See it up high
You can see it down low
See it on times square
I dont own it no more
We see it on the billboard
On you're your bedroom floor
my universal pussy
Comin through your door
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar
my universal pussy and a superstar

If there was nothing that I could say
Turned your back and you just walked away
Leaves me numb inside I think of you
Together is all I knew
We moved too fast, but I had no sign
I would try to turn the hands of time
I looked to you for a reason why
The love we had passed me by
And as the sun would set you would rise
Fall from the sky into paradise
Is there no light in your heart for me
You've closed your eyes you don't longer see
There were no lies between me and you
You said nothing of what you knew
But there was still something in your eyes
Left me helpless and paralysed
You could give a million reasons
Change the world and change the tides
Could not give me the secrets
Of your heart and of your mind
In the darkness that surrounds me
Now there is no peace of mind
Your careless words undo me
Leave the thought of us behind
You could give a million reasons
Change the world and change the tides
Could not give me the secrets
Of your heart and of your mind
In the darkness that surrounds me
Now there is no peace of mind
Your careless words undo me
Leave the thought of us behind
If there was nothing that I could say
Turned your back and you just walked away
Leaves me numb inside I think of you
Together is all I knew
We moved too fast, but I had no sign
I would try to turn the hands of time
I looked to you for a reason why
The love we had passed me by
And as the sun would set you would rise
Fall from the sky into paradise
Is there no light in your heart for me
You've closed your eyes you don't longer see
There were no lies between me and you
You said nothing of what you knew
But there was still something in your eyes
Left me helpless and paralysed

Dirty Business
It's a corporate house of cards
I cooked the books I'm pushing hard
I've got to get my piece of the pie
Eye to eye I've got the lie
CH
Dirty business
I got my hand in the Corporate cookie jar
Im a corporate paradox super star
Limousines and fancy cars
With all the dirty girls of the corporate world
CH
Dirty business
BR
I've got an offshore account
Loophole for my gain
All the political clout money can bring
Siphon off all your money
Who are you going to blame
You'll never know what hit you
It's all the same
CH

Bones and flesh hair and skin
And the smell of a king
He touched you and you fell
Once again like a stone
Pale blue hands eyes like sun
Beams you up lets you down
So you feel once again
Pretty son like a stone
Your venus man your venus man
Catch him and hold him, if you can
If you can't hold him drop him now
That venus man that venus man
Tried to find all these nights
Running round falling down
Met your friend and she told
That he's gone. Is he gone?
Dancing round waving veils
Sad drops down from your face
And you sing and you dance
Yes you dance 'til you dream

Low
Ceiling space
Along the restless water
The surface ripples
And words rise
Nearly touching my feet
So slowly
It seems we talk
Not knowing
It seems we talk
So slowly
It seems we talk
Not knowing
I am half inside

[Chorus]
There's no limitation to what this beat can do
You better get the feeling before the night is through
[Chorus]
Break the beat while I'm comin' up strong
[Chorus]
Contrast
Contrast
Contrast
Contrast
Break the beat while I'm comin' up strong
Contrast
Contrast
[Chorus]
Contrast
Contrast
Contrast
Contrast
Break the beat while I'm comin' up strong

It's better to have and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust you'll have to leap without the fall
Your best friend asked if I was straight or gay
I can understand the question when I dance this way
Straight I said, he said that's okay
Some other little something might be coming your way
A little while later and up you slide
Sipping on your drink and making moves at my side
I've got to impress her with my mating routine
Show her something no New Yorker will have ever seen
So I pull out the peacock knees of surprise
She laughs and tells me that I sprayed sweat in her eyes
I apologize, stand still on the spot
She puts her hand on my back and says "Wow you're hot"
You turn me on
It's as clear as the ice melting in my glass
There was no need for questions to be asked
Skip the how ya dos, what ya dos, political views you've hear the news
The oh my god it's different here you have to tip with every beer
It's clear, so little time to waste
Make the move, haste post haste
This is lust as first sight
Let's knock at the night 'til it retreats to light
I'm in New York making out in the back of a cab
And she's giving me her body to taste, touch, and grab
I'm fulfilling a cliche, ticking a box
Big Apple, yellow cab, and an American Fox
The city gliding past us block by block
I never, ever, ever want this cliche to stop
Knowing that sky scrappers rise above
I could have swore I felt a crazy little surge of love
The love of lust, directed at you
Do you feel the same way too
Please tell me that you do
And we can love lust the whole night through
They say it's better to have loved and lost then never loved at all
Just love the lust you'll have to leap without the fall
You turn me on

Hear my stilettos
Hear my stilettos moving cross the floor
you and me were supposed to be
living life as one
then you blew it, I knew you'd do it
cause you're just that dumb
don't apologize, no more dirty lies
baby you're all i want
then you played with her, and with her, and her
now the love we had is gone
fool me once and shame on you
fool me twice you never do
boy you see me walking walking towards the door
in my stilettos moving cross the floor
fool me once and shame on you
fool me twice you never do
boy you see me walking walking towards the door
hear my stilettos moving cross the floor
oh baby please is all I hear
you said enough please, disappear
then you blew it, I knew you'd do it
just you wait and see
no more late night creeps
underneath my sheets
if you're thinking you'll be back, forget it
don't apologize, no more dirty lies
watch me walking walking walking out the door
fool me once and shame on you
fool me twice you never do
boy you see me walking walking towards the door
in my stilettos moving cross the floor
fool me once and shame on you
fool me twice you never do
boy you see me walking walking towards the door
hear my stilettos moving cross the floor
bet you thought i'd never leave you
standing in my breeze too
wonder where you went wrong
maybe next time you can find a way
to make it happen, but listen
baby i'm gone
fool me once and shame on you
fool me twice you never do
boy you see me walking walking towards the door
in my stilettos moving cross the floor
fool me once and shame on you
fool me twice you never do
boy you see me walking walking towards the door
hear my stilettos moving cross the floor
hear my stilettos
hear my stilettos moving
hear my stilettos
hear my stilettos moving cross the floor

It's Big Fris and I'm back at it
I was raised in the jungle so I act savage
Make you disappear no black magic
I smoke cess that will leave you short of breath like an asthmatic
No round of applause but there's chaps clapping
Man see the size of this skeng and start backtracking
Enough of these idiots, need to knuckle down and stop chatting
Nobody over here spits like you? Cuzzy stop gassing
I ain't got nothin but shots for that crack addict
If you been shuttin for years and still can't buy a whip fam you need to stop trapping
And I know man are pissed the way we came in the game and took everything over
But I'm happy now cause when I was young
I said "I really wanna spit bars when I'm older"
You man are soft like cushion. Big Dutty Stinking hard like boner
On the road to success, follow me
Flatten emcees in my way steamroller
Keep telling them over and over, so many bars in my folder
Armani fragrance mixed with a little high grade yeah that's my odor
I'm stubborn, overly ignorant
I hate waiting I ain't got patience
Good manners, you can take me home to Mumsy
Yeah that's my persona
When the album drops my name's gonna be ringing in your ear like a Motorola
And if you don't pay then I won't spray
I'm after the cream no soda
Straight to your neck like a choker
Sicker way off the Richter
'Nuff of these emcees don't get the picture
Boy Betta Know be a household name
We be known to you to your Mom, Dad, Auntie and Uncle
Stepbrother, Godmother, Brother and Sister
No dilly no dally I'm straight to the point like a glass of Henny with no mixer
That means I ain't beating around the bush unless it's Chantel's
Don't mean to be rude but I have passed through a couple man's jails
Last year went Jamaica saw mad shells
Mad skengs big straps couple hand-helds
I set the plan well test if you want come try your luck
We ain't gonna be nice when I see the cyber thug
Gimme a 'StayFresh' beat and I'ma light it up
Wild it up Go get your C.V. done type it up
I've come a long way since running the streets
with Danny & Dean, Sammy & P
I'm about in my ends bloody cheek
You ain't alive in your ends

You know I, you know I do this properly
Gimme more paper, I wanna purchase land in Jamaica

Cause I'm cool but nothing like Coolio
Nowadays man roll with a 9 living in a gangsta's paradise like Coolio
I've got to be top 3 selected, these dickheads
ain't erected, they're not hard
They tried to front but they got parred
Ain't got to be close I aim from far
Don't think cause I emcee that I won't pop it off, make it rain and tear through cars
I come through like "Yo, wagwan?"
You wanna hype up? I'll draw man's card
And I'm back again
Big Frisco on a track again
No I'm not skimpy with beats, I'm nippy with Ps
Plus I'm picky with beats
And them man are slow I'm lapping them
I don't hate haters I give thanks to them
A couple emcees are ahead of me, minor, Frisco's catching them
I'm catching up, still cashing in
Man violate I'll smash him in
Frisco's gone no catching him, runaway flows no matching him
I'm on point cause I know what success can bring
Niggas hate Frisco's getting it in
So I stay on my Ps and Qs
Cause it's not about next man getting my bling
Never that

The flesh is weak, it goes one way
For these weeks of winter days, this cold won't go away
Through the young and carefree years, danger always was there near
As your will dissolves in tears of fear
Time will show what is threshed
Also sown, like a thrush, time has flown
If there's another world who knows
Past these Cadillacs in rows
Close your eyes, think of someone that you loved
And trouble not, remember all the joy they brought
For life is full of tears, and like a shot
It's soon over dear, but love is not
What a nightmare to be young, as the first rays
of awareness, like the sun, burn the fog away
Life brings death, but smile, and draw another breath
And when the disco dance is done
And last night's fun looks sick in the sun
And you don't know what's begun
Close your eyes, think of someone that you loved
And trouble not, remember all the joy they brought
For life is full of tears, and like a shot
It's soon over dear
Love's not enough to make the waves less rough
But like blood, a little goes a long way
In the darkness of uncertain days
It hurts to love someone this way
Though we seek to know its stay
The flesh is weak, it goes one way

You have become
What you have always been
Life figuring out
Peripheral vision
No words we can speak
Our paths have been chosen
All trails we trek
Should lead us back to here because our
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I've found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when I've broken down I've found
Love can come again
Deep within me
Turn all the secret stones
Voice of fields
Breathing when love holds
Still no word we can speak
A path should been chosen
But all trembling track
She lead us back and here the guts are
Love comes again
Just when I booked in none of her
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when I booked in none of her
Love can come again

Remembering me, discover and see,
All over the world, she's known as a girl,
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep,
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last.
God is a girl, wherever you are,
Do you believe it, can you receive it,
God is a girl, whatever you say,
Do you believe it, can you receive it,
God is a girl, however you live,
Do you believe it, can you receive it,
God is a girl, she's only a girl,
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
She wants to shine, forever in time,
She is so driven, she's always mine,
Clearly and free, she wanted to be,
A part of the future, a girl like me,
There is a sky, ILLUMINATING us,
Someone is out there, that we truly trust,
There is a rainbow, for you and me,
A beautiful sunrise, eternally.
God is a girl, wherever you are,
Do you believe it, can you receive it,
God is a girl, whatever you say,
Do you believe it, can you receive it,
God is a girl, however you live,
Do you believe it, can you receive it,
God is a girl, she's only a girl,
Do you believe it, can you receive it?

I was young now time's gone
Oh, what do i do?
He was mine for some time
Now this girl is blue
And all the love that we earned
Has been forsaken
And all the depths of my world
Have been awoken
What is life without him?
Please, what should I do?
I was just a humble girl
Who got lost in your world
I will cross a thousand seas
To forget that boy
And all the love that we earned
Has been forsaken
And all the depths of my world
Have been awoken

I don't usually go all in, babe
But you're a hum that I had to play
And you took me all the way
Make me lose more than I could win, babe
And I really need to let you know
I'm not above love, I just ran out of it
I'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care
And I know you're thinking the worst of me
But I hope one day you'll see
I'm not above love, I just ran out of it
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
And I only got myself to blame
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you
I'm not gonna call you in
'Cause you're taking everything
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you
I don't usually overdose
But you're a drug that I had to take
Another fix, I couldn't wait
Now the edge is far too close
So I really need to let you know
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
And I only got myself to blame
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you
I'm not gonna call you in
'Cause you're taking everything
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you
You took me to a place so far from here
You took me to another atmosphere
But I got so high, I couldn't breathe
And I've been holding, holding, holding, holding, holding, holding
I'm not above love, I just ran out of it
I'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care
And I know you're thinking the worst of me
But I hope one day you'll see
I'm not above love, I just ran out of it
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
And I only got myself to blame
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you
I'm not gonna call you in
'Cause you're taking everything
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you

If you let her go
You're gonna end up lonely
And if you really know
Yeah, you know, that's your folly
Cause you'll never, never ever
Have a girl like me
Cause I'm the best
You'll ever have
I can vouch for that
So don't come to me
With your broken heart
I won't mend it, I'll just wring it out
Oh, you're sorry, it's your folly
You made a big mistake
Seven times five, seven times five, seven
Now what you need
Is to look for your redemption
Seven times eight, seven times eight, seven
Don't look at me, take a look at your reflection
Oh, you're sorry, it's your folly
You made a big mistake
And you can search from Jupiter to Io
You'll never find another girl like me
Cause I'm the hot, lickin', kickin', lustin' empress
And it's a shiver, you'll never feel
So you're sorry, it's your folly
You made a big mistake
Seven times five, seven times five, seven
Now what you need
Is to look for your redemption
Seven times eight, seven times eight, seven
Don't look at me, take a look at your reflection
Oh, you're sorry, it's your folly
You made a big mistake
Well, it's too late
Yeah, it's just too late, it's just too late
Yeah, it's just too late

Heard a shout of someone calling,
Strange and darkness.
People lack all feelings
Over the city tonight.
Hanging by behind the trees of,
Blood red mornings.
Watching all this waiting for you
Dread in my head.
Where the wind sings by the river
Laughing, broken.
Hair swept out into the water,
Ripples of black.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Oh it rips through the sky.
Oh life figures on.
Jo, I know you will see.
Don't wait for a minute.
Shiver while you breathing
All the while you breath land
(Oh you see winter)
Shiver while you breathing
All the while I breath land
Feel the grey at dawn meaning,
Sunset, spoken.
Where the wind sits by the river,
Ripples of black.
Days, you gotta run
You gotta run for your life (repeated)
Oh your light feel you breath
Don't run with me.
Oh they'll leave you breath.
Don't wait for a minute.

Call him Mr Raider, call him Mr Wrong, call him Mr Vain
Call him Mr Raider, call him Mr Wrong, call him insane
He'd say : I know what I want, and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr Vain
I know what I want, and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr Vain
Call me Raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr Vain
Call me what ya like,
As long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura of the man none to compare
Loveless dying for a chance
Just to touch a hand, or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge that makes them want to lose themselves
To the debonair one
Hold me back the simple fact is that I'm all that
And I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me now, you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now : I want you
Then I want a little more
Girls are all over the world
They hope and pray and die for men like me
Cause I'm the one begotten son that breaks the mold
Get a look at the male epitome
Style has never seen that makes you want to grab and hold
And squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself
When you want to take a bite
Please oh baby please
You beg, you want to say you got to get some caught up in the charm
That I laid on thick, and now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to on the hook of my lines yeah I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart with S-E-X and plenty

Well, I've had too many a
Good cry for you
Well, this is my time to say
Goodbye to you
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through
This is not yours alone
It hurts me too
Please don't say you don't care
I know you do
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through
Love is not enough for me
If it screams when you hold it
Love is not enough for me
Love is hurting if it screams
Oh, if it's screaming out loud
I've been screaming for love, oh oh
Love is not enough
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through

Here I come to find myself catch the tide
Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself, fever's high
I'm all at sea and so unwise
I'm so afraid I'll lose your love as times goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset built a memory, our love sign
And all at sea we come alive
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I design
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all at sea we say goodbye
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
Looking for a place called home
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home

I'm waiting longing for you
One more night and then I'm gone
It seems so crazy how
That we just only met but I know
I am your visitor
I'm on the other side of your world
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
Head first in love
Thunder, lightning and rain
Imagine you're lying here again
Trying to get me out of here
Trying to get me back to you
You were always on the land
I was always in the air
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
Head first in love
It seems so crazy how
That we just only met but I know
I am your visitor
I'm on the other side of your world
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
Head first in love

Hey guy - you're the one for me
Your face - the sweetest thing I've ever seen
Stop by - dedicate to me
Your time - your time
At night - it really gets to me
I find nobody is here with me
Stop by - say you'll stay with me
You're the one I really miss
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Hey guy - you're the one for me
Those eyes - the loveliest I've ever seen
Stop by - Just to say to me
You're mine - you're mine

I wander through the world
No meaning in my life
My mind is driving me insane
The hurt I've kept all years
So much want it to end
Don't want to live with this pain
I cannot follow through
As a downward sees a joy
Provide my mind with a cure
As I need to get my high
To choose to help me fly
Is a cost of my sorrow and my pain
Oh god please let me go
Let me leave the misery
I'm so tired in my head
Can't keep on living like this
Cause I have no life you see
I shall end my own misery
Oh god please let me go
Let me leave the misery
I'm so tired in my head
Can't keep on living like this
Cause I have no life you see
I shall end my own misery

Retour à moi même
Come back straight to me
Je suis tant preoccupée de toi.
I'm so worried about you.
Speak, understand,
Mon amour, my love my love, my love
Come to me,
Pas tristesse, pas des chagrin.
No sadness, no grief.
Si tu que m'ai porté de moi,
It was you, who brought me back to myself,

WISH UPON A STAR
YOU`RE SO NEAR BUT YET SO FAR
DON`T YOU SEE THE LIGHT

CUTE AND SWEET IS WHAT YOU ARETOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
AND I'M SO IN LOVE
WITH YOU

Won't you have some of that?
Won't you have some of that?
Won't you have some of that?
Won't you have some of that?

It's time to celebrate
It's time to open up
Throw your cares away
And get them bottles up
Lift your hands high
No more crying ...
Music all around
Dancing to the sound
Don't let problems get you down
Let ... move around
No matter who you are
You're a star
So get ready
Everybody in the place
If you're ready to have a good time
Put your hands in the air
Let's go

Are you ready for a good time?
And if you're ready sing along with me
Are you ready for a good time?
Are you ready?
Are you ready for a good time?
And if you're ready sing along with me
It's time to raise your hands
It's time to scream and shout
Party all night long
And let your problems out
Get into this groove
Make your body move
Dj play that song
I need to get it on
Don't let problems get you down
Let ... move around
No matter who you are
You're a star
So get ready
Are you ready for a good time?

Robby make me a gown!
So that i can go back
So that that i can go
Into the garden
With cuddly tiger
And do all things
And do all things
And do all things
And do all things
Robby make me a gown!
So that i can go back
'Cause i'm only scared
Of see through
When i am far away
From texture
And the times i allow needles
I feel in one
And that's when i become
Instantly ready
To do all things
To do all things
To do all things
To do all things
To do all things
To do all things
To do a-all things
To do all things
Robby make me a gown!

Feel the steering wheel
Hear the crushing steel
Feel the steering wheel
Warm leatherette
Warm leatherette
Warm leatherette
Melts on your burning flesh
You can see your reflection
In the luminescent dash
Warm leatherette
A tear of petrol
Is in your eye
The hand brake
Penetrates your thigh
Quick -- Let's make love
Before you die
On warm leatherette
Warm leatherette
Warm leatherette
Warm leatherette
Warm leatherette

Backpack on my back, walking down a railroad track
Oh, I've been wanting to see you
Eyes upon the rows of trees, an endless sea in front of me
Oh, I've been longing to see you
You've been on my mind, talk about a lonely time
You don't know how much I need you
Once I feel the downy snow, the only home I've ever known
I'll hold you close when I see you
There's no way I could let you go
There's no way I could let you go
There's no way I could let you go
And it seems to me
We sing soft and low
Such a sweet hello
Backpack on my back, standing on a railroad track
It won't be long 'til I see you
Why do I always have to leave the only one I'll ever need?
Now hold me close while I breathe you
There's no way I could let you go
There's no way I could let you go
There's no way I could let you go

We sing soft and low

What could you see? What could you find?
If we meet, please avert your eyes
What I'll never show, what you'll never find
Is explosive so hide your eyes, so hide your eyes
What should mean nothing to you
Has left a poison running
Straight from your lips and into
Lead to the poison I'm becoming
Walk right through me, I'm not really there
What could you see? What could you find?
If we meet, please avert your eyes
What I'll never show, what you'll never find
Is explosive so hide your eyes
Once it meant something to me
I find it rather stunning
I draped it in cold and in clarity, it's true
I find the look becoming
Walk right through me, I'm not really there
And what could you see? What could you find?
If we meet, please avert your eyes
What I'll never show, what you'll never find
Is explosive so hide your eyes
It's a day, it's a day gone away
Turn away from the day, it's explosive
It's a day, it's a day gone away
Turn away, turn away from the day, it's explosive
What could you see? What could you find?
If we meet, please avert your eyes
What I'll never show, what you'll never find
Is explosive so hide your eyes
What could you see? What could you find?
If we meet, please avert your eyes

What'll it be now mister mole
Whisper sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat
Or play pharaoh
Dance with me
And shake your bones
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting
To bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Leopards laze each
On plush pillows
Slender capes
Of red and chrome
Paperback dreams
In their deep doze
Twitch their toes to
Black mambo
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting
To bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Wanna play cheat
Now says the sloth
A domino
Flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek
And take your throne
Pump your veins
With gushing gold
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting
To bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you

He knows well his wicked ways
Are 'cause of bitterness
A grudge held from his childhood days
As if life had loved him less
Reading down his list of names
He ticks them one by one
He points the barrel at the sky
Firing shots off at the sun
I am the law and I am the King
I am the wisdom, listen to me sing
He carves out the victim's names
In the wooden butt of the gun
He leans well back against the tree
He knows his Kingdom's come
He'll breath a sigh self satisfied
The work is in good hands
He shoots the coins into the air
And follows where the money lands
I am the law and I am the King
I am the wisdom, listen to me sing
He pauses at the city's edge
Of hellfire and of stone
He summons up the devil there
To give him courage of his own
He'll free the sinners of deceit
They'll hear his name and run
His justice is his own reward
Measured out beneath the sun
I am the law and I am the King
I am the wisdom, listen to me sing
And my name's on the gun

There's no one to believe in, out there on your own
It's a life without meaning, left outside alone
Someday somewhere someone will care
Your heart, one try, you can fly so high
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Tears may fall and worlds collide if you will give me love tonight
Everything's gonna change, I can tell by the voice inside
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Do you know what it feels like to leave it all behind?
Maybe what you were missing is not what you will find
Someday somewhere someone will care
Your heart, one try, you can fly so high
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Tears may fall and worlds collide if you will give me love tonight
Everything's gonna change, I can tell by the voice inside
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Everything's gonna change, I can tell by the voice inside
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Tears may fall and worlds collide if you will give me love tonight
Everything's gonna change, I can tell by the voice inside
Everything will be alright 'cause I can feel your love tonight
Tonight, ohh, tonight, ohh, tonight, ohh, tonight, ohh

I'd live for you
I'd die for you
Do what you want me to
I'd cry for you
My tears will show
That I can't let you go
[Chorus]
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
(You still want me don't you)
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
(Cos I can see through you)
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
(You still want me don't you)
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
(Cos I can see through you)
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
Don't get me down
Don't make a sound
Don't throw it all away
Remember me
So tenderly
Don't let it slip away
[Chorus x2]

Kid what changed your mood
You've gone all sad so I feel sad too
I think I know some things we never outgrow
You think it's wrong
I can tell you do
How can I explain
When you don't want me to
Kid my only kid
You look so small you've gone so quiet
I know you know what I'm about
I won't deny it
But you forgive though you don't understand
You've turned your head
You've dropped by hand
All my sorrow, all my blues
All my sorrow
Shut the light, go away
Full of grace, you cover your face

Here am I
Feel the sky
Never been so high
Here I am (please...deny...)
Here I am
So high
Eeeeee...

The working day was long
And the road is grinding on
And your body's winding down again
The tribal fire's here
And the circle speaks so near
And the simple truth so very much clearer
Who got the hooch, baby
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Let's get real, let's get heavy
Till the water breaks the levee
Let's get loose, loose, who got the hooch
The birds and bees will sing
The jams begin to ring
The good vibes flow from me to you
The evening turns to night
The fire and moonlight
The dance of all who came before
Who got the hooch, baby
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Let's get real, let's get heavy
Till the water breaks the levee
Let's get loose, loose, who got the hooch
{Music Intermision}
Who got the hooch, baby
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the hooch, baby
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Who got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world
Let's get real, let's get heavy
Till the water breaks the levee
Till the water breaks the loose
Who got the hooch
Who got the hooch
a baby baby (x3)

For all those who stood up and were counted
For all those for whom money was no motive
For all those for whom music was a message
I want to thank you
For making me
A little more sure
A little more wise
And courageous
You told me to look much further
You told me to walk much more
You told me that music matters
And to chase the dogs back from my door
I won't stop here
I won't be still until the sun sets
On us all
Under the sheets with my radio
Turn down low
So nobody know
It's the late night show
Hopin' to hear Hey Joe
Jimmy was my hero
Head blown by Type are or was it the true star?
From Dali Lama to Tanamo
Curtis Mayfield
Say Kurtis Blow
Singing into my pillow
And praying I don't dose
Until my 9 Volt battery goes
You told me to look much further
You told me to walk much more
You told me that music matters
And to chase the dogs back from my door
I won't stop here
I won't be still until the sun sets
On us all
You told me to look much further
You told me to walk much more
You told me that music matters
And to chase the dogs back from my door
I won't stop here
I won't be still until the sun sets
On us all
You told me that music matters
You told me that music matters
You told me that music matters
You told me that music matters

Make this night the one,
there's riots in the streets,
but we're just havin' fun,
champagne is down the drain.
Not before we're done,
the world is gonna end,
and we're just havin' fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.
Everything is free.
Make this night the one,
there's riots in the streets,
but we're just havin' fun,
champagne is down the drain.

Here he comes the boy who tried to vanish to the future or the past
Is no longer here with his sad blue eyes
Here he comes he floated away and as he rose above reason
He rose above the clouds he was seven feet high
Here he comes the night is like a glove and he's floating like a dove
That catches the wind in the deep blue sky
Here he comes the boy who tried to vanish to another time
Is no longer here with his sad blue eyes
Here he comes here he comes
Here he comes the boy who tried to vanish to another place
Sees us following him all one at a time
Here he comes and we're checking out each others supplies
And looking at the eyes of all the others standing in the line
Here he comes the night is like a glove and he's floating like a dove
With his deep blue eyes in the deep blue sky
Here he comes the boy who tried to vanish to the future or the past
Is no longer alone among the dragonflies
Here he comes here he comes
Who will remember him

[Verse 1:]
Blow by blow
I didn't see it coming
Blow by blow
Sucker Punched
Rushes in
Here to stay
Rushes in
You are here to stay
[Pre-Chorus :]
What rushes into my heart and my skull
I can't control
This violent feeling in my bones
What rushes into my heart and my skull
I can't control
[Chorus :]
I feel you in my bones
You're knocking at my window
You're slowly letting me go
And I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
[Verse 2:]
Left hook
I didn't see it coming
Left hook
You've got dead aim
Rushes out
Run away
Rushes out
You always run away
[Pre-Chorus :]
What rushes into my heart and my skull
I can't control
This violent feeling in my bones
What rushes into my heart and my skull
I can't control
[Chorus :]
I feel you in my bones
You're knocking at my window
You're slowly letting me go
And I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
I feel you in my bones
You're knockin at my window
You're slowly letting me go
And I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And then my skull feels (pressure)
I feel it in my bones (pressure)
I feel it in my skull
I feel you in my bones
You're knocking at my window
You're slowly letting me go
And I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
[Bridge :]
I take a breath
Take a breath
With me blow by blow
Take a break
Take a break
From you you are here to stay
I take my heart out of my chest
I just don't need it anymore
Take my head out of the game
I just don't need it anymore
I take a breath
Take a breath
With me blow by blow
Take a break
Take a break
From you you are here to stay
I take my heart out of my chest
I just don't need it anymore
Take my head out of the game
I just don't need it anymore
[Chorus :]
I feel you in my bones
You're knocking at my window
You're slowly letting me go
And I know this feeling also
This feeling in my bones

Tell me are you better?
Now you put your life on hold
I can't make it better
Cause this story's getting old
And you took the only part of me
And made it into misery
Now I'm left in the cold
While this story's getting old
Though I'm done
(Done Repeat x15)
And even though I'm not sold
(Sold Repeat x15)
You're always laying low
(Low Repeat x15)
How could I let you go
(Go Repeat x15)
Did you get a new me, or something not quite the same?
I know that it's been months, but I hope that this will sit in vain
And a million times I'm told that my story's getting old
But tell me are you better?
Now your new life starts to unfold
Though I'm done
(Done Repeat x15)
And even though I'm not sold
(Sold Repeat x15)
You're always laying low
(Low Repeat x15)
How could I let you go
(Go Repeat x15)
I know I sort of pushed you away
But even if I had enough time I doubt you would have stayed
You think you've seen this once and a match will lead away
But then he won't make it better on any note he plays
Though I'm done
(Done Repeat x15)
And even though I'm not sold
(Sold Repeat x15)
You're always laying low
(Low Repeat x15)
How could I let you go
(Go Repeat x15)
Though I'm done
(Done Repeat x15)
And even though I'm not sold
(Sold Repeat x15)
You're always laying low
(Low Repeat x15)
How could I let you go
(Go Repeat x15)

Information is crystallizing into your mind
Don't need to pray
Don't need to bow
But we are true believers when the sun goes down
Here on the rock
Look out to space
Don't need no gravity to hold our love in place
The solar heat
Get off the seat
A combination to the place where planets meet
Sharpen up the knives
But not to kill
We're gonna slice the night right open, let it spill
Oh, let me show you
Let me show you love
Oh, let me show you
Let me show you love
Oh, let me show you
Let me show you love
Oh, let me show you
You've got to live right now (Right now)
No need to think
Just got to do
Went through the rhythms of the universe, it's true
Come let it go
Just seize the day
You leave too fast, you'll never know, that's all I say
Oh, let me show you
Let me show you love
Oh, let me show you
Let me show you love
Oh, let me show you
Let me show you love
Oh, let me show you
You've got to live right now (Right now)
Get up, now fall in love
Get up, now fall apart
Get up, now fall apart
Get up, now fall in love
Get up, now fall in love
Get up, now fall apart
Get up, now fall apart
Get up, now fall in love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love

I will ?
I'll just try to ?
I will ?
I'll just try to ?
I will ?
I'll just try to ?
Not forget

Elegance throws the dart to the flying outed
but the herds and the flocks don't care
Tennessee takes a break to a broken window
but the herds and the hounds don't care
How dreaming is meaningless
So trivial, meager
But not to me
Not to me
Not to me
But not to me
Glaciers breakdown
I don't need them
Glaciers breakdown
I don't see them
...
So if this is the best
Why, Why can't i taste it
Somewhere else
Glaciers breakdown
i don't need them
Glaciers breakdown
i don't see them
...
Wishing takes so much to the
but the hounds and the swans don't care
...
can't move, can't move, won't move

So I creep, creep creep back to your seat
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it
You look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it

And I can't go through it

'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes
Put your skills on show, oh

Where the light burns a little brighter
where the shadows dance on the walls
where holy men hide their holy secrets
the sacredness of life is sold
standing under gold and silver
I see the procession rise
seated in his thrown of power
he proceeds to close his eyes
They try but the stone has broken
they try but the ceiling falls
they try but there's no momentum
they try but don't we all
na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

It's hard to find the balance
When you are in love.
You're lost in the middle
Cause you have to decide
Between mind and heart,
Between mind and heart.
Heart is the engine of your body
But brain is the engine of your life
Between mind and heart.
Heart is the engine of your body
But brain is the engine of your life.

I want nothing but the love of the next stranger who
Walks through that door
I want nothing but to dissolve in the night and to feel
Direction no more
I want nothing, no I want nothing
I want nothing,no I want nothing
I want nothing but to follow you til we can walk no more
I want nothing but to cut away until I find the core
I want nothing, no I want nothing
I want nothing, no I want nothing
I want nothing, no I want nothing

The brother's gonna work it out
The brother's gonna work it out
The brother's gonna work it out

Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice
So find another way
Oh I cried to you
Please follow me oh follow me
Oh whooa
Find another way
Find another, another way
Shake it, break it
No I can't fake it
To another level, can't take it
Pressurize and hypnotize
And in your mind, realize
And move, move
No I gotta move
Yo, so, watch me groove
Beat to the beat
Fire and heat
Make you jump right outta your seat
Gotta jam jam, watch me jam
To the beat, yo watch me slam
Pumpin' pumpin' looking for something
Always question leaving nothing
Shake it shake it every day
Keeping busy day by day
To find, to find another way

Waterfall, waterfall
Running down the hill
Waterfall, waterfall
Running down the hill
Running down from soul
Following my will
Running down from soul
Following my will
Mindmachine, mindmachine...
Riverside, riverside
under an orange sky
Riverside, riverside
under an orange sky
Fading to black and white
Passing passing by
Mindmachine, mindmachine...
Ocean wide, ocean wide
calming down at last
Ocean wide, ocean wide
calming down at last
Listening to the changing tides
Drawn to the past
I feel drawn to distant places
Drawn to the past
Mindmachine, mindmachine...

Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?

With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?

Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy

Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name? I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on and rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on and rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
(That's it sir, you're leaving)
(The crackle of pigskin)
Come on and rain down on me
(The dust and the screaming)
(The yuppies networking)
From a great height
(And the panic, the vomit)
From a great height, height
(The panic, the vomit)
(God loves His children)
(God loves His children, yeah)

There was a time
There was a place
But there was fear inside
A witty lie to save my face
The parachute of pride
To cross the line takes a tiny step
But will this spark cause the bridge to burn
My fear entwined with my regret
I'll be the path for safe return
So here we are
All just the same
But you will never know
My secret plan
How close we came
To share another role
I haven't lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside
Is it just me
I'd like to know
Or are we all just a little blind?
There's a thing called love
That we all forget
And it's a wasted love
That we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget, forget about a thing called love
There's a thing called love
That we all forget
And it's a wasted love
That we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget, forget about a thing called love

Can you see me falling
Can you hear me calling you
Shadows of pale - pass by
You're ready to sail - and I
Will love you
Forever
You're tearing me down - but why
My daydreams are bound - to die
I'll miss you
Forever
CHORUS
Hear me queen of light
Help me through the night
And deep inside
Missing links are hurting
Queen of light
Tell me why
You hide
There behind the curtain
Can you see me falling
Can you hear me calling you
All that we had - were lies
We're ending with sad - goodbyes
The story
Is over
Playing it cool I'll try
I'm breaking the rules - and I cry
I want you
Forever
CHORUS
Can you see me falling
Can you hear me calling you
CHORUS
can you see me falling
can you hear me calling you

There are mountains and tribulations
Moments in trepidation
There will be days, so trying
But in the end there's love
There are minutes and decades
Of stories, triumph and glory
There will be days so filled with joy
But in the end there's love
There are oceans of tear drops
Heartbreaking and your life stops
There will be times of deep sorrow
But in the end there's love
Love, it is there
It is yours, it is power
Love, when it hurts
When it heals, when it showers
Love, when you can't
When you doubt, in that hour
Love will never leave you
Love, when you fear
When you're lost and you're broken
Love, when you cry
When you weep, feel alone
Just love through the pain
Love through the shame
Love through your darkest days
There must be
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There are windows of wisdom
Wake up calls, you must listen
There are the tests and testimonies
But in the end there's love
There are wicked ones who try to steal your hope
Evil ones try to drug your soul
There is a light that you must seek
Cause in the end there must be love
Love, it is there
It is yours, it is power
Love, when it hurts
When it heals, when it showers
Love, when you can't
When you doubt, in that hour
Love will never leave you
Love, when you fear
When you're lost and you're broken
Love, when you cry
When you weep, feel alone
Just love through the pain
Love through the shame
Love through your darkest days
There must be
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
I wanna go higher, I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher, I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher, I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher, I wanna go higher
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love, there must be love
There must be love

I wanna watch you sleeping peaceful
Resting your heart and your soul
We should never awake without the other
Lying by our side
I wanna learn from the calm with which you
Aim at your dreams and your goals
And I'm sure your stories always will unfold
I try to get you up
But you go down
And you are not okay
I wanna carry you
But you won't get up
It's really killing me
You know it's killing me
I wanna join you sleeping peaceful
Feeling the sun in our room
What a plenty of rays and beaming light
Surely, it does me good
I wanna trust the pulse
In which decay is followed by bloom
And I'm sure any flaw will turn out beautiful

Every day brings change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And this whole world seems like a new place
Secretly I've been tailing you
Like a fox that prays on a rabbit
I had to get you and so I knew
I'd have to learn your ways and habits
Oh, you the catch that I was after
But I looked up and I was in your arms
And I knew that I was captured
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just aren't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
But love hit me with a sudden slap
A warm kiss and then I knew
Oh, my plans didn't work out
Like I thought
Cause I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just aren't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
But love hit me with a sudden slap
A warm kiss and then I knew
Oh, my plans didn't work out
Like I thought
Cause I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught
What's this whole world coming to?
Things just aren't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game

I, I wasn't even searching for love
... stop calling you, my love in my heart is true, yeah, yeah,
... myself, soon... I'm dripping, and my...
Got my hands way up, I surrender to love
What a feeling, somebody gonna... ,
What a feeling, I'm loosing control
What a feeling, feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling, to let it all...
What a feeling, I'm loosing control
What a feeling, feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, what a feeling
A new life, I used to think I'll never fall in love
... my favorite... used to stare... up and down,... oh yeah
Hope and love returned I was waiting
... love
Got my hands way up, I surrender to love
What a feeling, somebody gonna... ,
What a feeling, I'm loosing control
What a feeling, feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling, to let it all...
What a feeling, I'm loosing control
What a feeling, feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, somebody gonna... ,
What a feeling, I'm loosing control
What a feeling, feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, what a feeling

"Won't you let me, well you know I can drive
Please let me take your car
Won't you please let me take your car"
Two policemen in the car behind
Not on duty but they stopped
And just before the car caught fire
Bravely they pulled her off
Bravely they pulled her off
Bravely they pulled her off
Bravely they pulled her off
If I were you Chrissie I'd rather

Well painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love
Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall
And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
And will you listen?
Lover alone without, without love
No, no I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
'Cause no one's receiving
This tunnel vision
It's turning out all wrong
And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
And will you listen?
Lover alone without, without love
Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry
And if I tell you
Lover alone without love
What will happen
Lover alone without love
And will you listen?
Lover alone without, without love

He tried to tell you it was over so many times
You kept convincing yourself that he would change his mind
You never thought that love could do this to you and him
You thought that it was supposed to be innocent
You gave him everything and more that you had to give
Three shining faces that will never fade
So tell me what it's like to be on his own again
He makes it look like it's easy but I've heard
That one before
No place for tears
You're giving him everything
All or nothing
No pain, no gain
Now you can chase your dreams
Chase your dreams
He ??? so we can tell him down the phone
???
You feel as if you loose a something that wants was yours (?)
No one could ever take away what belongs to you
If you don't want to choose the choice will be made for you
It doesn't matter what he decides to do
He's working ??? you'll have to find your way
If you don't ?? your life you gave it all away
No place for tears
You're giving him everything
All or nothing
No pain, no gain
Now you can chase your dreams
Chase your dreams
He lost you while he was trying to find himself
It's nothing new, I see it happening all the time
So tell me, tell me, has he found what he's looking for
He had the icing on the cake and he wants some more
I know it's not been easy making it on your own
Don't let it get you down, were here, you're not alone
You've got your girls, what love, they'll always be by your side
The grass has always been greener on the other side
No place for tears
You're giving him everything
All or nothing
No pain, no gain
Now you can chase your dreams
Chase your dreams
No place for tears
You're giving him everything
All or nothing
No pain, no gain
Now you can chase your dreams
Chase your dreams

I dread panic within your tight embrace
I ban the violence from my feeble frame
Choose your weapon and go to war instead!
Anchor me in a sea of silence
Harbor me with my restless mind
I live revenge with my second skin
I feel the echo pounding in my head
I know this feeling deep within
It makes no sense to hide from what you are
Malice, i dare to linger
Malice, i won't attempt to flee
Malice, just for a moment
Malice, to bundle all my rage
Poorly gifted i still try to reluct
Let me surrender my weakish sense of bliss
Kind of awkward to find this faith in you
Torn between extremes
Please meet my state of mind
Please accept my reason for being born
to grant my last request
my malice never fails

Run For It (feat. Leigh Nash of Sixpence None The Richer)
I can't fight the fighter, I keep losing ground
and I can't hide the hider with you hanging around
I can't and I won't
You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking [Repeat: x2]
I can't love a hater, its a losing game
Never love a quitter, you'll get left in the rain
I can't help the helper when my feet are bound
I can't feel you near me if you're not the only sound
You are, you're not
You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking
You better count up your reasons, I'm leaving I'm leaving [Repeat: x2]
You better count up your reasons
I'm leaving I'm leaving
How do you like the way it feels when I leave you? [Repeat: x2]
Leave you
You are, you're not
You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking
You better count up your reasons, I'm leaving I'm leaving [Repeat: x2]
You better count up your reasons

I slept til I threw up
I slept til I threw up
Gone are the days of
Wine and roses
They just make me
Nauseous now
I slept til I felt drunk
I slept while you had lunch
Lunch with a girl who
Has hair as
Soft as baby's breath
In morning
Lunch with a girl who
Takes time to
Listen to every word
You utter
I slept til I woke up
Then there was not much
Much to do so
I think of you
I crawl back
Between the sheets

He doesn't mean a thing to me,
Just another pretty face to see,
He's all over town, knocking them down yeah honey,
And I'd never let him next to me,
He's the kind of guy who thinks he's smart,
He's the type that always looks the part,
He's on the make, he's on the take,
And I'd never let him touch my heart,
He didn't mean to catch my eye,
Well he's lucky he just walked on by,
'cause he hasn't met a girl like me
Are you kidding?
Well I'd tell him that i'd rather die....
He doesn't mean a thing to me,
Just another pretty face to see,
He's all over town, knocking them down yeah honey,
And I'd never let him next to me,

He's the type that always looks the part,

How can I change the world if I can't even change myself?
I cannot change the way I am?
I don't know, I don't know.
I take a look at the world behind these eyes,
Every nook, every cranny reorganize,
Realize my face don't fit the way I feel.
What's real?
I need a mirror to check my face is in place,
Incase of upheaval, fundamental movement below,
What's really going on I want to know,
But yo, we don't show on the outside, so slide.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...
I need a mirror for my spirit,
Yeah, can you feel it?
When I get deep, want to hear myself sleep,
Not drowning, tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud,
I wonder what it's like to be dead,
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot,
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...
I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep,
The pills ain't cheep but the bills are steep,
So I [?] with a booze and a spiff,
Try to snooze,
But who's dreaming, this is win or loose,
Put down the drink, try not to think,
Let it go, fundamental movement below,
And yo, reality is dreaming,
Just below my skin I'm screaming...

Aisha
We've only just met
And I think you ought to know
I'm a murderer
Babies need blood
I have a portrait on my wall
He's a serial killer
I thought he wouldn't escape
Aisha
He got out
We live in a cemetery
A cold and damp place
And science runs through us
Making us Gods
The rules are all Wrong
Every perversion is justified
They honestly believe dead bodies
Anything goes around here
I still want to to be human again
What am I?
What am I?
I'm a murderer
Aisha
I'm confused
Aisha
I'm vibrating
I'm a murderer
The Gods all suck


You know the moon
You know the stars
You know the Milky Way

I walk the city late at night.
Does everyone here do the same?
I want to be the things I see,
Give every face and place my name.
I cross the street, take a right,
Pick up the pace, pass a fight.
Did I grow up just to stay home?
I'm not immune - I love this tune.
I want to love more.
I just want to love more.
I drag the city late at night.
It's in my mouth, it's in my hair.
The people fill the city because
The city fills the people, oh yeah.
I cross the street, avoid the freeze -
A city's warmer by a couple degrees.
The smell of food. The smell of rain.
I'm not immune - I love this tune.
I want to love more.
There's a river in my head.
I just want to love more.
There's a river in my head.

There was a little boy once upon a time
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind
For every copper penny and clover he would find
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times
For no more cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
His clothes were always clean
His face was always scrubbed
There was food on the table enough to fill him up
His house was full of life - His house was full of love
But when winter days arrived
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs
But with nobody to share the life he'd made
No body to keep him warm at night
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God
When a woman passing by brushed his arm
He turned and found love
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger
Who she was to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things
So he promised more than he could buy
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He worked day and night his fingers to the bone
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on
He can't give her what she needs
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land
But some guys he knew from high school days
Said they had a plan to get rich quick
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms
Dreamt about the life he'd buy
The comfort that would come without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around
He said the little boy is dead
A man stands with you now without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
Without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
He thought he'd set his clock right, He though he'd read his watch
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck
Makes no difference if you're early, No difference if you're late
When you're out of time, The flowers have been laid
You're six feet underground
With cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

You're all too older today
All my words, they've flown away
I'll wait around for another soul
With those birds out in the bay
Making their rounds like I knew they would
All my thoughts left me again
Bliss me out, send me away
I'll wait around for another soul
Watch those birds out in the bay
Making their rounds like I knew they would
Running all around
Running all around
Running all around
Grassy, still, late afternoon
Saw your face swimming in the blue
You lie around for an hour or two
Watch us kids play in our parks
Dropping our lines like a gospel tale

Destination unknown...

Somewhere nobody must have duties at all.

Gangsta Boogie, in my all black hoodie
Real recognize real, all fakes are buried
In the cemetery, cause if you shake like jelly
You ain't gonna be ready, so Boop like Betty
Cold truth for ya yellow belly, 'cause you scared
Butterflies flapping in your eyes, that's you dead
Now you living in a killer's mind
No loose ends that's nuisance
No body no crime from the start line
The greatest Al Capone of our time
You keep running and I'll show up where you might hide
Decide now if wanna be a knight rider
Or lights out rapture that ass like a mobster
Tight crowd full of veterans who played contra
And I doubt that'll ever tell you that you harder
Mind out cowboy wanna lose ya partner this my house gangsta
Headphones strapped to skull cap
Head gone feeling like King Kong giving Jessica Lange back
I'm feeling all that Kenan way before the claps
If Kel was here he'd hand me the orange soda cap, why?
Can't lie yo I'm live as the vinyl spinning double time
Around the vibe so you might lose ya mind yo
Look around like where'd the time go?
Guess our father brought an onslaught
Of another aura to make ya mind go staccato
Strings of heart compose straight classics for kings of art
So if you're thinking that you're that sick I think you're not
I'm Mr. Rooney kicking hatricks
To class this you'd have to flip the game backwards
Just like Nas did, the first is the last kids
As if you could match this
You could try to light my fire but my water's earth and wind

It's absolvation of obscenity
Obscenity of obviousness
The obviousness of power
The power of simulation
Ravishing hyper realism
Mind blowing

Look in trees
Through the window at the moor
Like some
You play with my cheek, yeah
Whisper somewhere I was born
Liquid light harmony
Wrapped around inside of me
Born out of trees
On a moonlit song
It's free
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Head in a storm
I'm driving home to you
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Licking the tar
I'm almost there for you
Wind down the window
And feel a rush of air around my face
Breathe in light
Wet and warm
Feel the outside coming in
Look at the trees in the dark
Bending like a bony finger
Gravel flicks on a metal moon
Wild and free
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Head in a storm
I'm driving home to you
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Licking the tar
I'm almost there for you
Light licks the trees
Feel the rush
Cold air wrap around my head
You play with my cheek yeah
Whisper something nearly dawn
Shiny and warm, head in a storm
Licking tar, I'm driving home to you
Coming around, coming around
Coming around, I'm driving home to you
Coming around, coming around
Coming around, I'm almost there for you

[I think it's time to discuss your ... ah ...
Philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavor]
Check it, yo!
I always hit the tape with a rough road style
You heard the psychdelic and ya came from miles
Keep my rhymes thick like a Danish brew
So you could call me black and tan when I'm a wreckin' a crew
I'm like Bill Lee whacking when he's in Tangiers
And now I'm out on the sole surviving with my Beatnik peers
Analog reel and a little distortion
Smokin' on somethin' s'you could say I'm scorchin'
I never been the type to rap up a well
Make a man burn his draft card like it was hell
Send ya up the river like you lookin' for Kurtz
I got the mugwump jism up in every verse
(Refrain 2x)
Bug powder dust a mugwump jism
And the wild boys runnin' into some trippin'
Led into control about the Big Brothah
Try like hard to not blow my cover
Who's that man in the windowpane
Got somethin' on his tongue and it's startin' to stain
Sho' nuff equip so wop n'get dancester
Butt bond my ladder and you'll get beat down
Hash bond style so I'm singin' day glow
Wakin' up the dead like serpent and the rainbow

Are you ready?
Can you see what you wanna be? Can you see everything is free?
Can you see it reversely? Can you see it's you and me?
Every night I wanna dream of you and the feelings I can see in you
Show me what I mean to you, show me oh please
Can you see what you wanna be? Can you see everything is free?
Can you see it reversely? Can you see it's you and me?
Every night I wanna dream of you and the feelings I can see in you
Show me what I mean to you, show me oh please
Are you ready?
Can I make you smile again? I just wanna still be friends
Everyday I think of you, can I make this feeling true?
Every night before I sleep, the thought of you makes me complete
Nothing better comes tonight then loving you all night
Can you see what you wanna be? Can you see everything is free?
Can you see it reversely? Can you see it's you and me?
Every night I wanna dream of you and the feelings I can see in you
Show me what I mean to you, show me oh please
Can you see what you wanna be? Can you see everything is free?
Can you see it reversely? Can you see it's you and me?
Every night I wanna dream of you and the feelings I can see in you
Show me what I mean to you, show me oh please
Are you ready?
Can you see what you wanna be?

Agnes just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now stop and breathe a second
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head
Your head is so numb
That nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions
That trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes
A choking rose back
To be reborn
I want to hold you like you're mine
You see the sad in everything a
Genius of love and loneliness and
This time you overdid the liquor
This time you pulled the fuckin' trigger
These days you're rolling all the time
So low so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion dollar smile?
Guess life is long
When soaked in sadness
On borrowed time
From Mr Madness
And so it goes
A choking rose back
To be reborn
I want to hold you like you're mine
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why

(Intro)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take you (X3)
(Chorus)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take you down down down down
(yeah)
never hit the ground, ground, ground, ground
(X2)
(Verse 1)
talking about short days, long nights, clean bottles, on ice.
Red lights, all right, this is life, talkin' bout
Short days, long nights, clean bottles, on ice.
Red lights, all right, this is life, talkin' bout (yeah)
~Devon "Tomahawk"

Good things come to those who stay on their toes
So don't ever stop, always keep it hot
Oww! Oww, oww!
Baby! because I like what you do to me
Baby! because I like it and its all for me
I like my friends exciting, if they keep my fever rising
Cause I always like to keep it hot
Little girl, come to play and i'll bet you want to stay
And I guarantee I'll hit the spot
You be good to me I'll be good to you
Anything you want anything you do
I've got my eyes on you, and I intend to
Give it all I got and to keep it hot
Oww! Oww, oww!
Baby! Tell all your friends that we're moving on the one
Baby! If you can take it you'll have more than enough
I hear plenty people talking, but those same people are walking
But they still try to tell me how to keep it hot
But girl you stick with me and with both our eyes we'll see
It's not very hard to keep it hot - I just know what I know
Let us take a chance, to enjoy romance
Life can be a 10 if you let love in
Here's all you have to do to make it pour right through
Give the best you've got and we'll keep it hot
Oww! Oww, oww!
Baby! and I really want to know
Baby! let's not pretend let's get on with the show

What is her name
That caravan girl
What is her name?
You like the sun
A hazy day
What is her name
We're just talkin'
Like there's something
Like you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Runaway, runaway you, you get away and
Bring on back
Runaway, runaway you, you get away and
Bring on back
The food and game
That stranger on the hill
What is her name
You like the sun
A lazy day
Have you no name
Don't stop talkin'
There's just something
Like you know
I liked to know
You should
Or should I go
It's long, long
Way to go
I want to know
Yeah
I want to show
Runaway, runaway you, you get away and
Bring on back
Runaway, runaway you, you get away and
Bring on back
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
And bring on back
(La la la la la)
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
And bring on back
(La la la la la)
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
And bring on back
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
Wanna runaway
(La la la la la)
And bring on back

Oh my love look and see
The sun rising from the river
Nature's miracle once more
Will light the world
But this light is not for those men
Still lost in an old black shadow
Won't you help me to believe
That they will see a day a brighter day
When all the shadows will fade away
That day I'll cry, that I believe
That I believe
Oh my love high above us
The sun now embraces nature
And from nature we should learn
That all can start again
As the stars must fade away
To give a bright new day

The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above, aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets
They're all uptight, uptight
They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board of their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away, but I'll be alright, alright
I'm just uptight, uptight
I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
I'm just uptight, uptight
Just uptight
Uptight

When I'm travelling far from home
On the white horizon,
I can feel you're still around,
And the dream overtakes me.
Then I know
You'll stay in this moment
We'll go where its flowing.
You'll be what you want to be
Right here with me.
When I'm out here on my own,
And it all cuts through me.
I see you're safe alone,
Oh then it hits me.
And I know
You're here in this moment,
Right where its flowing.
You are what you want to be
Right here with me.
Stay in this moment.
Go where its flowing.
You are what you want to be
Right here with me.

She's here in the snowfall at dead of night
The mood is of courtship, the final fight
She's all that I need, all that I am
The voice of compassion inside the man
You open the gates the madness begins
I'll follow you down, I'll follow you back in
She's here in the lifelines in every curve
Suspended in silence between each word
It's all in the way that she moves
The grace and the light that will see me through, it's coming true
She's prising the rope from my hands
The fear and the hopes that I held onto, it's coming true
Color the river I swim back to you
Krishna blue, Krishna blue, Krishna blue
Waist deep in water, she starts to sing
The voice is familiar and draws me in
She's lighting the fires, I dowsed by hand
Erasing the figure drawn in sand
You open the gates, the madness begins
I follow you down, I follow you back in
And here in the darkness, the boundary gone
The flame is alive and burning strong
It's all in the way that she moves
The grace and the light that will see me through, it's coming true
Color the river I swim back to you
Krishna blue, Krishna blue, Krishna blue, Krishna blue
In the softest belly and the warmest heart
In your open hands I lay my head
In the never ending, I fall apart
In the silent forest and the brilliant red
And through the stream of words
There comes a sound
And I listen, child like
To her voice spellbound, spellbound
It's all in the way that she moves
The grace and the light that will see me through, it's coming true
She's prising the rope from my hands
The fear and the hopes that I held onto, it's coming true
Color the river I swim back to you
Krishna blue, Krishna blue, Krishna blue, Krishna blue

She was no longer a user
Don't think she realized we knew that
Not one to make a fuss
Why this and not something else
Wasn't it obvious?
She made such a hash of it
You can't help but notice
And a absence of tenderness
And who wants to live like that?
And friends turn their backs on her
She no longer a user
And she wanted to stay home
With a box full of postcards
And no place to send them
Live like Emily Dickinson
Without so much as a kiss
Or the comfort of strangers
Withdrawing into herself
But why this,
And not something else?

I've lost my belief in everything
A collapsed ship in a bottle
Waiting to be raised
Flat and isolated
Up on the mantle.
A tell tale sign signaling a change to come
I sit here and I wait for the wave
A tell tale sign signaling a change to come
Tonight the sea calls
Fills me with remorse
When I ride my last wave
This 100-year storms final charade
My ghost drowned in shame
I'm gonna be the guy shattering all the glass in my glass house
Standing before the mast I'll cast the first stone
And dance between the shards
It calls
Tonight the sea calls
Fills me with remorse
When I ride my last wave
This 100-year storms final charade
My ghost drowned in shame
And it calls
And I go
Seaward

Last night, I turned into a fly
I got through your window and I landed in your eye
You were sleeping, you didn't mind
So I flew further down, inside your opened mouth
Down your throat, I tickled around
And then you cough me out, oh yeah, you cough me out
I hid behind the curtains till you fell asleep again
I just hope you understand, I just wanna be your friend
Out on the street, inside a rubbish bin
Or a garbage can, depends on where you live
Oh, I live nowhere, now I'm a fly
I fly around, I fly around
And you will see me, hanging around
Outside your flat, inside your car, behind the chair
Well, everywhere
I'll be everywhere you are, just to let you know
I've been watching you around
You really oughta know
I fly around, I fly around
I fly around, I fly around
I fly around, I fly around
I fly around, I fly around
Last night, I turned into a fly
I got through your window and I landed in your eye
You were sleeping, you didn't mind
So I flew further down, inside your opened mouth
Down your throat, I tickled around
And then you cough me out, oh yeah, you cough me out
I hid behind the curtains till you fell asleep again
I just hope you understand, I just wanna be your friend

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favourite things
Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favourite things
Girls in white Dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver White winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favourite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling bad
I simply remember my favourite things
And then I don't feel so sad

Well, I remember you
From a different occasion
And you remember me
You said I wasn't your kind
Oh, but baby, baby, baby
I think we'd have a good time
You got the savoir faire
Of a seasoned vet
I need a love affair
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
See, we could go out
And I could flip the bill
But when we get home, girl
You know how you gotta make me feel
Oh, but baby, baby, baby
I think we'd have a good time
Oww
Your whole demeanor is outta sight
You got me wonderin
Won't you come home with me tonight
That type of body
I pictured it with no clothes
But when it went down
Down, down, down, down
I guess I got scared and I froze
Oh, but baby, baby, baby
I think we'd have a good time
Mmm, baby, baby, baby
I think we'd have a good time

Standing high above us all
At the edge of the diving board
Smiling and waving
Before letting himself fall
The faintest splash
(As the water engulfed him)
It was beautiful to watch
So beautiful to watch
He was probably the world's best diver
Probably the world's best diver
He was the world's best diver, probably
Touching the bottom
He pushed away with both legs
And cut through the surface like a fish
The faintest splash
As the water engulfed him
It was beautiful to watch
So beautiful to watch
I stay high above
He was the world's best diver
(But he could not swim)
It was beautiful to watch
So beautiful to watch

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Turmoil, carnage
Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers
Stampede of sharpshooters
Come straight from voodoo
With our feet thumping
With our feet marching
Grinding skeptics into the soil
Shower of goodness
Coming to end the doubt pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end
We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo
I have guided my bones
Through some voltage
And loved them still
And loved them too
Metallic carnage
Ferocity
Feel the speed
We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo
There is turmoil out there
Carnage, rambling
What is to do but dig
Dig bones out of earth
Mudgraves, timber
Morbid trenches
Here come the earth intruders
Stampede of resistance
We are the canoneers
Necessary voodoo
And the beast
With many heads
And arms rolling
Steamroller
We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Forgive this tribe
We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching
March
March

Lying very still
underneath the Sun
Waiting for the cool of
the night to come
I pick up a stone
Press it in my palms
Throw it out to sea
and count wishes

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home
But I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You can never look back."
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but-
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

You want to fly on the wings of an eagle
Everybody has to dream
Well you fight like a fighter, you look like no other
Take what you want, you think you'll ride with the demons
As deadly as the seven sins
You think that you're magic, but I'm no believer
And you fight like a little contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses, return to sender
Your words, they come to no good intentions
You preach every word you say
Your sticks and your stones break more than my bones
You say you love me, then you hate me, then you're hot then cold
Head to toe in diamonds, you're not undersold
You think that you're magic, but I'm no believer
And you fight like a little contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses, return to sender
I want to help and I want to protect ya
But you got your spies telling lies
Where do you go?
You change colors like a tiger in the snow
And you fight like a little contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses, return to sender
I want to love you girl, but somehow I can't let you in
Disguised in all your makeup like the seven sins
You've got your magic, but I'm no believer
And you fight like a little contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses, return to sender
I want to help and I want to protect ya
But you got your spies telling lies
Where do you go?
You change colors like a tiger in the snow

We can make our heart move in another place
We can touch the ground up in outer space
We can find the sun in another way
We can hold each other for another day
Oh the way, the sound, the silence is the mushroom cloud away from everything
Time to face ourselves in preparation for the shells to keep it safe from everything
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
3, 2, 1
Cause when the bomb arrives,
there'll be no where left to hide
Yeah when the bomb arrives,
there'll be no where left to hide
And when the bomb arrives,
there'll be no one left behind
No one left behind
We should pack our things just to get away
We could make our move at the break of day
We should disconnect; no more time to waste
We could ride out in a distant place
Oh the way, the sound, the silence is the mushroom cloud away from everything
time to face ourselves in preparation for the shells to keep it safe from everything
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
3, 2, 1
Cause when the bomb arrives,
there'll be no where left to hide
Yeah when the bomb arrives,
there'll be no where left to hide
And when the bomb arrives,
there'll be no one left behind
No one left behind
We can watch the fire rising up like morning lights
We can watch the beam shoot across the evening sky
10,9,8,7
We can watch the fire rising up like morning lights
6,5,4
We can watch the waves shoot across the evening sky

I'm flash and blood ? baby,
I'm skin and bone,
Every inch of me a man.
I'm meek and milk ? baby,
From head to toe,
And I've tried to be the best I can.
But I've been mad ? baby
I've been confused
I know that's hard to understand.
But I've got dreams ? baby
And they need you
You've got the future in your hands.
Baby pain ? baby pain.
I was alone ? baby,
Love pulled me through,
Out of the darkness came a sign.
Now that was you ? baby,
You pulled me through,
You came to me and saved my life.
My bleeding heart ? baby,
Still beats for you,
Still beating hidden here inside.
Still beating strong ? baby,
Still beating true,
Still beats to keep our dreams alive.
Baby pain ? baby pain.
Still beating strong enough for two.
Baby pain ? baby pain.
Still beating here for me and you.
I've got the blues ? baby,
You got 'em too,
I know there's something we can try.
Now there's a cure ? baby,
It's good for two,
No sense in wasting no more time.
Give me your hand ? baby,
I'll give you mine,
It's time to leave the past behind.
Now we can try ? baby,
See what we find,
Then make it anything we like.
Baby pain ? baby pain ? baby pain ? baby pain.
Give me your hand baby,
Give me your hand....

It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Uh huh
Where all my brothers with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty, uh huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh huh
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my homie biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Y'all volume 2, sing
It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life

Get down
I wanna get it
Get down

(Luciana)
No bad boys, no champaigne
No false love, no mind games
No scandals, no?
No labels, labels
No ice cream, no candy
No too hot to handle me
No cigarette, just alcohol
Sliding easy down my throat
No french kiss, no ooh la la
My fake tan, my?
No chit chat, no slap on the back
Show me show me who you are
I like you
I like you
(Chorus)
I feel your leg on the dance floor
Rubbing on my ooh ooh
Bow wow wow
?
Is that your leg on the dancefloor
Rubbing on my ooh ooh
Bow wow wow
(Chipmunk)
No labels, labels
I drop girls like jag
I'm faded, I'm unstable
But my 2 step's just fine
And I like girls that like girls
You nicki minaj that's fine
And I'm crazy, but look baby
If you give me ha I'll shine
Okay she got the moves like jagger
Makes you wanna dagger
Wanna play boy I hear ya
My bank balance hits high notes
Like miss aguilera
I mc I can dance too
Swags cool, dance crew
Bodyrox and it's me chip

(Chorus)
I feel your leg on the dancefloor
Rubbing on my ooh ooh
Bow wow wow

Is that your leg on the dancefloor
Rubbing on my ooh ooh
Bow wow wow
Get down
I wanna get it
Get down
I wanna get down
This time I wanna get it
Get down

If all you keep hearing it so long you will see me as a super star
And you'll have time to waste with your minions and tink
I see your face in front of me,
Still grainy from that old black and white tv
My whole family silenced,
Watching you shape destiny with your 2 hands,
Faster than the eye can see.
Mesmerizing
You know what skinny little me started to struggle,
10 years old suddenly bold
Cause i resolved to live like my hero in the ring,
Be smart never give an inch,
No retreat when i'm wrapped up
Respect from teachers, red necks
And creatures who attack in a pack
Like incensed never seen the light not before or
Since a young prince
And i remain convinced of his invincibility
Athletic agility, virility,
Seen your free spirit for every through eternity stings
Like a bee Mr. Muhammad Ali
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
Your achievements defy belief from the belly of the beast rising like yeast,
My release from low self esteem
Came when i saw you rapping on my tv screen.
Float like a butterfly,
That describes my walk to school after fight night
I felt so cool cause i was at place too,
Love myself born slippy
Outta love for you,
And i knew that someday people would love me too.
None of that heckling about my black skin got through,
I would walk bare foot through hell for you,
It was how i felt back then i would still do for you,
So accept these humble words of praise,
And my gratitude for those glorious days
And your victorious ways,
Instilled in the young minds,
Skill sublime yours to mine!

I want to play with you tonight
Hold me, that's all that's on my mind
Baby, something feel so right
Maybe we could play tonight
I want to be somewhere with you
I want to do just what you want to do
I want to be all over you
I got a dream and you can make it true cause...
I, I'm fascinated by your love, boy
I'm fascinated by your love toy
I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
But I'm fascinated by your love, boy
I'm fascinated by your love toy
And I'm fascinated by the way you make me feel
Love me until the morning light
Please me, make me feel allright, uh uh
Kiss me, let me make you mine
I'm loving, loving you so tight

If I would know you, would you know me,
If I would know you, would you know me,
If I would know you, would you know me,
If I would know you, would you know me
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change,
Tell me that you'll feel the same, and we'll stay here forever,
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change,
Tell me that it'll stay the same,
Where we go, where we,
Where we go, where we go,
Where we go, where we go, where we go.
[Repeat x4]
Where we go, where we,
Where we go, where we,
Where we go, where we,
Where we go, where we go
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change,
Tell me that you'll feel the same, and we'll stay here forever,
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change,
Tell me that it'll stay the same,
Where we go, where we,
Where we go, where we go,
Where we go, where we go, where we go.
If I would know you, would you know me,
If I would know you, would you know me,
If I would know you, would you know me,
If I would know you, would you know me
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change,
Tell me that we'll stay the same,
Where we go, where we,
Where we go, where we go,
Where we go, where we go, where we go.

Something's disappeared inside
Should I try to run away
If I could I would escape you
I won't argue anymore
I have lost the will to be
Hope you don't think I'm ungrateful
Close the curtains, lock the door
Left my notes upon the stair
In the hope you wouldn't read them
Fake emotions in my head
Everything I've seen and read
Can't begin to find the reason
Why? Why are you laughing?
Is it something that I said?
I don't like this place at all
Makes me wonder what I'm here for
Someone take this pain away
Dying to see another day
And I don't want to be your friend
Or pretend I can fit into
I'm incensed, I'm blown away
Dying to see another day
I don't like this place at all
Makes me wonder what I'm here for
Someone take this pain away
Dying to see another day
And I don't want to be your friend
Or pretend I can fit into
I'm incensed, I'm blown away
Dying to see another day

They're coming from the air I'm breathing in and
they're coming from my friends, screaming in my head
They're lies about your name, lies about your grace
They're trying to take your place
To counterfeit you
I need you
More than a thousand lights on you
More than a thousand tongues that claim truth
The message and the light come from you
You see through the whitewashed tomb that I've construed and
you crash through my walls and I come falling off my pride
And everything I've earned is shown for what it serves
is shown for what it's worth
Just a counterfeit
And I need you
More than a thousand lights on you
More than a thousand tongues that claim truth
More than a thousand pictures of you

Yeah, pogo
There's something in the air
There's something in the air
There's something in the air
Now, where has it been?
I mean, the good old wild days
Became a bit too lame
Just take a look at my place
It's such a mess
But I'll be out of this space as soon as you tell me
Where the night is
You have to set up
Bring it on, forward
Yeah, pogo
There's something in the air, pogo
There's something in the air, pogo
There's something in the air
It's been quite of a while since I could experience your brightness
Now, you've got a brighter smile and I think I'm going to like it
Talking 'bout the better things, you know how to maximize
Everything around you will become super sized
You have to set up
Away from what matters
And get it prepared
Forward
Yeah, pogo
There's something in the air, pogo
There's something in the air, pogo
There's something in the air
Yeah, pogo
There's something in the air, pogo
'Cause I've been dreaming we could be the fire for this night
Can't stop
You have to set up
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Bring it on)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Forward)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Can't stop)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(You have to set up)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Bring it on)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Forward)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(Can't stop)
We could get so wasted if you would have come
(You have to set up)

My three guardian angles say
Each time you smile that way
Danger lies that way
No-one will believe me
For that sort of thing's beneath me
But I keep repeating three words
It won't last, it won't last
I've been here before it will pass
Don't say I'm mercenary
That's unnecessary
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
Desire is a child that clings
And I know the trouble it brings
I remind myself each minute
My home is here and my love is in it
But that's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
So, I keep repeating three words
It won't last, it won't last
I've been here before it does pass
Reason is unkind
But still I'll know next time
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live
That's not the way love is
Love is here where I live

Blue moon rose
I have a friend and she comes from the high plains
Wise as the hills and fresh as the rains
I have a friend and she taught me daring
Threw back the windows and let the air in
For all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose
I have a friend and we talk about books
She comes around and she drinks while I cook
Took me an atlas to find her town
And to realize that the world was round
For all she knows
Bless my blue moon rose

You were like a glimpse on to the stars
As we were dancing forward and reverse
One whole day
Under heavy rain
Don't ever say
That we weren't happy then
You were like a glimpse on to the stars
As we were dancing forward and reverse
One whole day
Under heavy rain
Don't ever say
That we weren't happy then
I miss the times
When everything was coming our way
I wish those times
Would brig us back together some day
You were like a glimpse on to the stars
As we were dancing forward and reverse
One whole day

Even if I told you
It's like I see my whole life
Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life
Flashing right before me
So even if I told you
It's like I see my whole life
[Repeat: x34]
Flashing right
Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life
Flashing right before me
So even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life
Flashing right before me
It's like I see my whole life
It's like I see my whole life
So even if I told you
It's like I see my whole life
[Repeat: x19]
Flashing right
Before me!
(Me)
So even if I told you
It's like I see my whole life
It's like I see my

She's had four since he last saw her
But she keeps it to herself
He wonders how he's gonna tell her
He wishes he was seeing someone else
He won't tell, but he still needs her
That it helps him go around
When he gets home, the house feels empty
From the bed, from the bedroom to the ground
Sometimes when she goes out
Sometimes she goes, when she goes
She knows, sometimes she goes out
She said she grows old when she goes

I feel so much sensation
You've been so good to me
Give you anything
You've been so good to me
Your love inside me
Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation
Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation
Every sky will be blue
As long as you're lovin' me, lovin' me
You've been so good to me
Give you anything
You've been so good to me
Your love inside me
Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation
Every sky will be blue
As long as you're lovin' me, lovin' me

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
I believe in the meaning of spoken word
The feeling of freedom and healing the bleeding
In need of a reason, I wrote this verse
Yo, I hope this works
Being strong feels exactly the same as being weak
The difference is you don't quit
Not until you reach the peak
I believe in the mean of the spoken word
It's more than a speech to speak
It's what I feel when I'm sitting in your presence
The answers are written in your essence
It's all a test to see if you're made for it
But best believe it's your claim on it
'Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
('Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it)
You're gonna go through things you don't deserve
And it's gonna hurt like an open nerve
So just know your soul's as old as earth
And whatever you do, don't be told its worth
Being strong feels exactly the same as being weak
The difference is you don't quit
Not until you reach the peak
I believe in the mean of the spoken word
It's more than a speech to speak
It's what I feel when I'm sitting in your presence
The answers are written in your essence
It's all a test to see if you're made for it
So go for it, you can't wait for it
'Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
('Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it)
Everybody's free to feel good (it's your fight, your glory, your right, your story)
Everybody's free to feel good (it's your fight, your glory, your right, your story)

Der neunte schuss ging sauber durch die stirn
(the nineth shot went directly through the forehead)

Deep down that was your all that I had
Dangling into the bed, I pray I'm there
I can't find the words to break your curse
Something inside the book or it bursts
It's wasn't I, I found the knife
Buried inside the bed, the looks of love
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
Who would've thought anything gone tonight
Is young and mine
Feeling extreme, I want you to breathe
The rest of your own fire
Diving into the bed, the night is young tonight
Even in space I look for your face
A spark or the light, baby
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
Coming through, connection with you
It makes my soul aroused
Unspoken like a machine
The force and the fire
Ease through, I found it in you
The animals are there
Shimmering through the evil in you
The dark is in the dark
I WANT YOU
I need you
I WANT YOU
I need
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother

I'm the sub-total of my ancestors
I carry their DNA
We are representatives of a long line of people
And we carried them around either with
This long line of people
That goes back to the beginning of time
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people
And we say bring together the lines of me
When I look back over the years
At the things that brought tears to my eyes
Papa said we have to be wise
To live long lives
Now I recognize
What my father said before he dies
Vocalize things I've left unsaid
Left my spirit unfed for too long
I'm coming home to my family
Where I can be strong
Be who I planned to be
Within me my ancestry
Givin' me continuity
Would it be remiss to continue in this way
Would you rather I quit
Come with that other shit
Making people's hips sway
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep
Like a lifeline, I light lines
'Cause my compassion is deep
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep
And this is who I happen to be
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be
This is what my Daddy told me
I wished he would hold me
A little more
Than he did
But he taught me my culture
And how to live positive
I never want to shame
The blood in my veins and bring pain
to my sweet grandfathers face
In his resting place
I made haste to learn and not waste
everything my forefathers earned in tears
For my culture
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
(For my culture)
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again.
Hello Dad,
Remember me?
I'm the man you thought I'd never be.
I'm the boy who you
Reduced to tears
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years
Yeah, that's right
My name Rob
I'm the one
Who landed the popstar's job
I'm the one who
You told look, don't touch
I'm the kid
Who wouldn't amount too much.
I believe in the senses that I sound
I have always been too loud
Won't you help me drown it out?
And When I feel
What I'm feeling is so real
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel
Always digging in my heels
Now I got the faith to
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again.
Ha, lace up your booty
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude
Feed freakin' for loot
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now
And your forefathers further know how
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth
This is what my Daddy told me
I wished he would hold me
A little more
than he did
But he told me my culture
And how to live positive
I never want to shame
The blood in my veins and bring pain
To my sweet grandfathers face
in his resting place
I make haste to learn and not waste
everything my forefathers earned in tears
For my culture
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again
(For my culture)
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
Water to air
Your on your feet again
Your feet again
(For my culture)

In my lazy lagoon
Take off my shoes
And take me to the blue
To the blue
With these tired dreams of mine
Time to take it to the blue
With this broken soul of mine
Time to take it to the blue
To the blue

Hey slow motion is the way for us to enjoy the day
Always taking time to listen what she got to say
She thinks I be spending too much time on the beat
I try to make her over stand that's how we eat

Don't be messed up by silly tendency
No no way

Ah feel as if I'm upside down in the ceiling
Confess, this girl is the ultimate thing
What it means to be loved, no need asking
Swing baby swing, while I continue sing
Your favorite song
Lets go dancing

Summer evening, I walk past the windows
Baby crying, someone's cooking dinner
There's laughter on the TV, someone's learning the violin
How that home appeals
At times like this, I feel
I would like to live like anybody else
In one place
I could be happy and fulfilled
In one place
So I get the map out
(Get the map out)
I draw a line of where we've been
(Goes through sea and sky)
It goes through sea and sky
Twenty-five planes this year
And it's only July
This is not some Bible, like "On the Road"
It's just a song about coming home
And whether
I could live like anybody else
In one place
If I could be happy and fulfilled
In one place
You know that I have found
I'm happiest weaving from town to town
And you know, Bruce said
"We should keep moving 'round"
Maybe, we all get too tied down, I don't know
Yeah, I don't know
Happy to be home
(Still I'm)
Happy to be home
(Alright)
In the end, if you take care
You can be happy or unhappy anywhere
I think we maybe all rely too much
On one place
Though I never would deny the need
For one place
I think, we maybe all rely too much, baby
On one place
I know I never would deny the need
For one place
For one place
(For one place, baby)
One place
(One place, baby)
Oh yeah
It goes through sea and sky
(It goes through sea and sky)
One place
One place
(Goes through sea and sky)
I'm happy to be home
(Still I'm happy to be home)
Happy to be home
(Oh, still I'm happy to be home)
Goes through sea and sky
(Sea and sky)

Get the map out
(Get the map out)
Won't you, baby?
(Get the map out)
Oh yeah
(Get the map out)
Get the map out, oh yeah, baby
(Twenty-five planes this year)
Get the map out, it's alright
(After all, twenty-five planes this year)
C'mon
Get the map out
(Oh yeah)
Get the map out
(Oh yeah)
C'mon, get the map out
I said, get the map out

I'm in way over my head,
Can't the find sunset over me
The mirror in front of my bed
Sees the one I said I'd never be
Try to escape from the storms,
Spinning over like a hurricane
Can't get away in the dark
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run
The stolen innocence
weights on my shoulders
It's heavy now
These broken nights we spend
They shine through the cracks till they way out
Try to escape from the storms,
Spinning over like a hurricane
Can't get away in the dark
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run
'Cause I don't wanna leave without you now
Only God believes you know this now
Just hold on to faith when we're still young
We were born to run

Once again I'm hiding in backwaters,
Running this way and that,
Trying so very hard to please.
(Beware of hidden snares.)
Rushing to bite the hand that feeds me,
Running this way and that.
(There are always other possibilities.)
This way and that.

You are not anyone
Don't sadden my life
You got to leave on Sunday night
It seems I'll feel all alone
You know the tears are in my eyes
I need some time to let 'em dry
I can't keep insisting 'cause I'm going too far
I feel sad and that is just for you
I would keep insisting on these lonely nights
'Cause I just can't get rid of you
You are just not anyone, anyone
I just want to keep in touch
Don't sadden my life
You are just not anyone, anyone
I don't want to lose your touch
Don't sadden my life
I don't know if you're wrong or right
I need somebody to love
You know I'm always on your side
So please don't let it fall apart
I can't keep insisting 'cause I'm going too far
I feel sad and that is just for you
I would keep insisting on these lonely nights
'Cause I just can't help but thinking of you
You are just not anyone, anyone
I just want to keep in touch
Don't sadden my life
I want to be the one, be the one
I don't want to lose your touch
Don't sadden my life

We are the synchronizers
Send messages through time code
Midi clock rings in my mind
Machines gave me some freedom
Synthesizers gave me some wings
They drop me through twelve bit samplers
We are electronic performers
We are electronics
We need to use envelope filters
To say how we feel
Riding on magnetic waves
We search new programs for your pleasure
I want to patch my soul on your brain
BPM controls your heartbeats
We are the synchronizers
We are electronic performers

I've been spending too much time talking to camera,
I've been doing this so long and I remember why
I need a movement
I need a shakedown
I need a free-fall, Ohh
Cause I'm dying
Yeah, I'm
Barely alive, but I'll, give it a try,
I've been, living a lie, but I'm, better now
(x2)
Well I know I've spent too much time just thinking about what I don't know
And maybe there's a better place for me that I could call home
I need a movement,
I need a switch up, yeah
I need a pick-me-up,
cause I've fallen
We don't, have to go through these changes alone
We don't, no, no, no, no
Spent my life, moving up and down,
fighting fires all over town,
I do the time but time's running out,
but I know one thing,
I am better now
Barely alive, but I'll, give it a try,
I've been, living a lie, but I'm, better now
Barely alive, but I'll, give it a try,
I've been, living a lie, but I'm better now
Barely alive, but I'll, give it a try,
I've been, living a lie, but I'm, better now

Stop the rock, (stop the rock)
Stop the rock (stop the rock), can't stop the rock.
Stop the rock (stop the rock), can't stop the rock.
Stop the rock (stop the rock), we can't stop the rock.
Stop the rock (stop the rock), we can't stop the rock.
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock
Shake my paranoia, my groove is grooving
Shake my paranoia, my groove is grooving
Dancing like Madonna, into the grooving
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Down and dirty baby
Down and dirty baby
Down and dirty baby
Down and dirty baby
We shake the rock like animals.
Everyday at the waterhole.

Roman land
Of Roman sands
And Roman sons.
As I watch the sun
sink down
On the bloodred edge
Of the bloodred town
There are shadows
for sale
On the edge of town
At the edge of the night
Is a darkness seen
From the side
of the light
(From the side
of the night).
And the winds
blow round
this sleeping town
This sleeping town
This Roman land
Of Roman sands
And Roman sons.
And it seems to me
That when I
close my eyes
All the lights in the world
Go out
And the night
passes by
And you whisper to me
A thousand lies
I stare in surprise
Towards the desert's
warm black
And the desert stirs
And the desert stares
back
With a thousand eyes
Piercing eyes
Ancient eyes
And I ask my lovers
"Do you know
Where the desert roses
bloom and grow?"

Now take me dancing
At the Disco
Where you buy your
Winniebago
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse
When the light turns into darkness
Will he turn up to explain us?
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse
Lend me a whole new world
All night
Feel life
When is there ever sense
To love
This world
In the whirlpool
We'll go deeper
In this world that's
Getting cheaper
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse
I like dancing
At the disco
I want blisters
You're my leader
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse
Oh I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh I love this feeling
Feels like real
Leather

Say goodbye as I'm walking on a wire
Close your eyes
You can leave me in the fire.
Don't need to justify
the way I feel tonight
because I know the plight, is worth the fa-a-all
into the neon sky, I chase another high
I left it all behind, so let me go-o-o
Just say goodbye as I'm walking on a wire
Just close your eyes
you can leave me in the fire
leave me in the fire
leave me in the fire
leave me in the fire
leave me in the fire

Talkin' funny and lookin' funny and talkin' 'bout
"Nobody loves(?) me" you make yourself look bad.
Help me somebody.
You need to take a good look at yourself a
And see if you're the kind of person that God wants you to be.
It's no big thing, it's a small thing, what... people... think(?).
Help me somebody.
There's no escape from Him.
He's so high you can't get over Him.
He's so low you can't get under Him.
He's so wide you can't get around Him.
If you make your bed in Heaven He's there.
If you make your bed in Hell He's there.
He's everywhere.
Woo! Help me somebody. Woo! Help me somebody.

You wanna go out tonight
You put your black dress on
Just a little make-up and the red lipstick, too
So you're walking down the streets
You do not feel the rain on your skin
You go to your favourite club
You feel like a hunter in this night
You're dancing to the music, you feel the beat
You move your body and you feel the heat
Everybody's looking at you tonight
When you're dancing in the light
You're dancing to the music, you feel the beat
You move your body and you feel the heat
Everybody's looking at you tonight
When you're dancing in the light
Look at me, I am the mistress of the night
See me dancing, see me moving in the light
You will never get me 'cos I'm dancing with myself
I don't want you to touch me
'Cause I'm the solitary girl
Why did you not see it coming?
You couldn't run away
It happened so suddenly
You couldn't speak a word
He pushed your head to the floor
He touched you everywhere
You taste your blood on your tongue
You're laying naked in the rain
You're dancing to the music, you feel the beat
You move your body and you feel the heat
Everybody's looking at you tonight
When you're dancing in the light
Look at me, I am the mistress of the night
See me dancing, see me moving in the light
You will never get me 'cos I'm dancing with myself
I don't want you to touch me
'Cause I'm the solitary girl
Look at me, I am the mistress of the night
See me dancing, see me moving in the light
You will never get me 'cos I'm dancing with myself
I don't want you to touch me
'Cause I'm the solitary girl

I never thought I'd grow up so fast so far.
To know yourself is to let yourself be loved.
And I want to be addicted,
I want to be secure,
I want to wake up after the night before,
but do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?
I'll press your hand against my face,
weaken my resistance.
I'll pull the sheets over our heads,
let the broken sky break above our heads.
And I want to be addicted,
I want to be secure,
I want to wake up after the night before,
but do you get me?
Do you ever get me?
Shower me with affection and I'll return in kind.
I have no hidden motive, I am blind.
I'm a stone inside a box,
I'm a spring inside a clock,
you can wear me on your wrist
and I'll tell you things ten thousand times,
but do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?

Put away your inhibitions
Let the beast in you just get loose
We all young, wild and different
We could all get lit from a lil goose
I know you're terrified by what the future lies
But there's no compromising, it's my way or the highway
We all just played the lust, hard building breaking trust
She gon' get wowed when we come out
Like she gon' get loud when the weed come out this instant
Give a fuck what your friends think
Tell they boozy ass go wait in line
With them lame niggas talking real rap
Tell 'em break your neck go and bust a rhyme
Blow one down, pass it around ay!
Fuck with me now, we're running wild ay!
Nobody game, we own the town ay!
Never come down, I'll never come down
Lose it
I might lose it
Lose it
I might lose it
Everybody got guilty pleasures
Mine just turned to catch me cases
Handcuffs, police inspections
Lawyers, judges, allegations
Turn on your favorite station
You hear the same old song
I feel like Nagasaki, dog
I'm 'bout to drop the bomb
Blow one down, pass it around ay!
Fuck with me now, we're running wild ay!
Nobody game, we own the town ay!
Never come down, I'll never come down
Blow one down, pass it around ay!
Fuck with me now, we're running wild ay!
Nobody game, we own the town ay!
Never come down, I'll never come down
Lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
Lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
Lose it
I might lose it

Far away from home
The place where i belong
When I close my eyes
I start to realize
Hold my breath
Trying to forget
Feeling so strong
A new day has come
(Summer sun)
(Summer sun)
Summer sun, keep me warm
Northern light
Come and dry my eyes
Summer sun
When I'm searching for belief
Has to put myself at ease
Every time I'm on the run
Find me summer sun
Find me summer sun
Far away from home
The place where i belong
When I close my eyes
I start to realize
Hold my breath
Trying to forget
Feeling so strong
A new day has come
Summer sun, keep me warm
Northern right, come and dry my eyes
Summer sun
Summer sun
Ooh oh
Find me summer sun
Ooh oh
Summer sun

Cold sweat - Running down my back!

You can't piss on fire snow covered angels
You can't dace, fuck face, dace without getting tired
You can't stash a child
You can't eat your shit
Fuck the rules, lets squirm this pit
Rules are rules
Shake ass and run up the stairs
To a high class meeting of bears
Warm, cozy, snuggly, furry
Let me see you dance and with no worry
Little kitty its time to be naughty
Hop skotch to the closest of raunchy
Shake your ass

There was something
Written down
Somewhere.
I don't quite remember where.
But,
That's not so important
Now is it?
There was something
Written down
Somewhere.
I don't remember who
Wrote it,
Nor the year.
And I cannot recall
Word
By
Word
What it was.
But,
It brought a feeling ofâ?¦
It's difficult
To explain.
But,
I sort of had the
Urge to,
Well,
Write it down.
And perhaps
Even memorize it,
So that
I could
Impress youâ?¦
There was something
Written down
Somewhere.
I don't quite remember where.
But,
That's not so important
Now is it?
As long as there was something writtenâ?¦
Down!

Some feel the excitement of boredom...
some don't...
but one day you will step outside
and you will feel the heat...
You hear the sirens of death and they sound afraid
We're back where we were ten years ago
and I'm feeling like I'm starting my old life from new
This is your last chance...
What's on your mind?
Nothing I'm gonna die for nothing!
Nothing else that matters...
but what do you want from me?
Anti-fashion seems to be fashion too by now
I don't need stupid policemen taking care about me
I don't need anyone!
I take it all by myself! Myself!
Can you hear me? Can You Hear Me?
Tell me the truth you fuckface!
I'm gonna kill anyone for more!
Suck me up for a better reason and I'm gonna cut you short...
If only technology keeps moving you forward
and you're not prepared for the future
you become a naive child left in an information overload unit...
What's holding us back is time!
World leaders choose world leaders...
not us, not democracy, not a revolution!
time to stop the germanization of the planet...
I've a fear of a white planet...
I redefine the enemy! redefine the enemy!
I have to redefine the enemy! redefine the enemy!
Redefine the enemy! Redefine the enemy!
I broke the ice and I drowned
they want you dead but alive enough to function!
Everything gets out of control
but what do you do? tonight?
Let's get back on the street
start living again...
Anything worth having is worth fighting for!
It's important that the future is on our side!
on my side...
white house and white snow...
The final moment has come...
It's all over!
It seems that you still have power in reserve...
but we are winning ...
Are you praying in your despair?
I redefine the enemy.
I redefine the enemy.
I redefine the enemy.
I've got to redefine the enemy!
Here I come! Don't bother me!
there's nothing we can do!
It's not my style to just wait to be killed!
I'll wipe you all out!
Now is the chance... I'm covered in a blue shadow...
I fear no longer...
I fear no longer...
I fear no longer...
I Redefine the enemy! Redefine the enemy...
I Redefine the enemy! Redefine the enemy...
I've got to Redefine the enemy...
Redefine the enemy...
Redefine the enemy...

Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying
Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it
Hands on my face over bearing, I can't get out
Lost, ran at my own cost hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such
And such bleak all around me, weak listening, incomplete
I am not a dog but I'm the one your dogging
I am in a buried kennel, I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
You all stare but you'll never see
There is something inside me
There is something in you I despise
Cut me, show me, enter
I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way, I can't die, purity

Are you receiving?
Can you feel me?
The information
That you're seeking
A sensation that is sneaking
Has you reaching
For the ceiling
There's no fighting
The igniting

All systems go out on the floor
This is what you came here for
Hi friend!
Hi friend!
Hi friend!
Hi friend!
Now your mind is open
Your thoughts are flying
To the bounce that's amplifying
Taking form
As you're complying
Grab the notion
Carry on replying
Adopt tension
Embrace mention
True ascension
Feeds retention
All systems go out on the floor

And if you feel, that you can't go on
Dig deep, be strong
And when it feels, like you've lived too long
Hang tough, dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
And if it feels
Like you're all alone
Stand tall
As one
As one

I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm
Eyes are open the mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer
Eyes are open the mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer
I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm
Oh, how I try
I leave the TV on and the radio
Oh, how I try
I leave the TV on and the radio

Night has fallen
Mute and cold
My horse is crying
But you know there is time
But you know there is time
But you'll never learn
Keep you safe
Dare to come
But you love me still
But you'll never learn
Tears to come
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
You have dammed me
But you're the one
That you're forever
And they stare
But you know
That there's strength
And you love a knight
Who stewed out those tears
Years to come
But you love the tears
And you love the tears
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 1]
First boyfriend
You live in my house and we share a toilet seat
And I am not the least bit drawn
The covers in divisive heaps
Scared of how little I care
First boyfriend
You live in my house and we share a toilet seat
And I am not the least bit drawn
And I am not the least bit drawn to your heat
[pre-hook]]
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
Nurse this erection back to full health
On the nights you roll over and introduce yourself
I am elsewhere
[Hook]
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Fated all the while
You know that this was never your home
Your life, your husband, your time
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Failed your Maiden Voyage
Failed a Maiden Voyage
Fated all the while
You know no love remains
No, not at all, no
No, not in either one of us
[Verse 2]
You don't do anything with your life
Fascinating, terrible - your stupid idling mind
I can prod your hurt all night
Or resign and find
Any other stupid thing to do with my time
I was never poetic and never kind
[Bridge]
Scared of how little I care for you
Scared of how little I care for you
Scared of how little I care for you
I am elsewhere

You can see there's something in the way
I've tried to show you, my door is open
I don't know how much more I can take
Since you've chosen, to leave me frozen
Am I the only one, who sees what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you stay?
People making choices they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and maybe say
Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
I'm not gonna compromise
Surely you can sympathize?
Say you feel the same
You've wandered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her? The grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only then why're lonely?
'Cause I'm the only one, who know the things you've done
I'm so good for you
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you do
Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
I'm not gonna compromise
Surely you can sympathize
Say you feel the same
Just don't say it will be alright
I'm not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Don't say it will all be fine
In only a moment you'll say goodbye
I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Something extraordinary
Something real
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel
Just don't say it will be alright
I'm not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Don't say it will all be fine
In only a moment you'll say goodbye

When I was ten I thought my brother was God -
He'd lie in bed and turn out the light with a fishing rod.
I learned the names of all his football team,
Aid I Still remembered them when I was nineteen.
Strange the things deal that I remember still
Shouts from the playground when I was home and ill.
My sister taught me all that she learned there;
When we Grow up, we said, we'd share a flat somewhere.
When I was seventeen, London meant Oxford Street.
Where I grow up there were no factories.
There was a school and shops and some Fields and trees,
And rows of houses one by one appeared.
I was born in one and Lived there for eighteen years.
Then when I was nineteen.
I thought the Humber would be the gateway from my Little world into the real world.
But there is no real world -

My weight is 300 pounds
My favorite is beef jerky
I'm a vagabond, I'm a vagabond
My mom says, "You are kinky!"
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Lay down here, baby
Just relax, honey
My baby horse is Jennifer
What a beefy hip!
She has a fine coat of fur
What shiny hair!
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours
Who cares? I don't care!
A horse's ass is better than yours

For each forgotten kiss,
For all the memories,
For all the times a look,
Said all we had to say,
You played your part so well,
A modern Romeo,
You came on Cupids wings,
And then you flew away,
When you touched my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
[Repeat x2]
When you touched my face,
When you call my name,
I'm burned with desire,
But you left me in the rain
For every sleepless night,
Forever in your arms,
For every hour spent,
Lost in the reverie,
You broke your promises,
No shame and no regrets,
You burned the bridges too,
An endless mystery.
[Repeat x2]
When you touched my face (So beautiful)
When you call my name (My name)
I'm burned with desire
But you left me in the rain

I don't want excuses.
I don't want your smiles.
I don't want to feel like we're apart a thousand of miles.
I don't want your attitude.
I don't want your things.
But I don't want a phone that never rings.
I want your love and I want it now.
I want your love and I want it now.
I don't want your history.
I don't want that stuff.
I want you to shut your mouth.
That would be enough.
I don't care if you've been here before.
You don't understand.
Tonight I feel above the law, I'm coming into land.
I want your love and I want it now.
I want your love and I want it now.
My heart is that much harder now.
That's what I thought before today.
My heart is that much harder now.
I thought that it would stay that way, before today.
Before today.
But I don't want a phone that never rings.
I want your love and I want it now.
I want your love and I want it now.
I want your love.

There's nothing left here to worry about
We're on the ground
We're in the clouds
The world is spinning around
There's nothing left here worry about
We are on the ground
We float on the water
Or up in the clouds
Alone through the clouds
Alone on the ground
Alone on the water
Alone in the clouds
Alone through the clouds
Alone in the water
Alone on the ground
We were born to be alone
Everybody all alone
Born alone to be alone
We'll stand alone forever
Standing on the world alone
Learning how to stand alone
And always to be alone
We'll be alone forever

There were times I could not see past all the decoys laid,
Placed in front of me
Just the frequency that was bothering me,
When all the time should have realized
Just your avenue for another escape
Just your avenue for another escape
I always felt that things would change (change for the best)
And for once I'd see some sort of progression
You always say you're down,
But when push comes to shove you always have excuses
Just your avenue for another escape
Just your avenue for another escape
You really need to think again
You know you have to make amends
Don't look me in the eye,
Assume it's alright
I won't be here for long
Only one reason for you not to change
Just your avenue for another escape
Just your avenue for another escape
And when you've had enough, don't bother even turning back to look at me
And when you've had enough, don't bother even turning back to look at me
And when you've had enough, don't bother even turning back to look at me
Just your avenue for another escape
Just your avenue for another escape

Sunbeam, stop tugging me
Pull that door shut quietly
Darling, what are you doing?
We don't have time for this
Mmm dey mmm da mmm daaeeoo
Mmm dey mmm da mmm daaeeoo
Crazy what are you then?
Give me an hour and I'll give you your dreams
Don't make a sound
Shh and listen
Keep your head down
We're not safe yet
Don't make a sound
And be good for me
Cause I know the way to somewhere out here
Leave it I won't go back
We have to do it 'cause it's not been left here
Don't care what do they know
I've seen them, baby, and I know it's real
Sure, in time, I knew they'd come
Oh, are we having fun or what?
Yeah
Don't make a sound
Shh and listen
Keep your head down
We're not safe yet
Don't make a sound
And be good for me
Cause I know they're waiting somewhere out here
I feel good all over
I feel good all over
I feel good all over
Even inside out

From the top you can see so far into the distance
Look it's downhill all the way from here
Getting there is quicker like going you just slide
Shouldn't take more then a year
I could almost like you
Now it's nearly over
Now you've shown some weaknesses
Now you're looking older
And I heard what you said
And I recognize those feelings
I know how hard it is to watch you go
And all the effort that it took to get here in the first place
And all the effort not to let the effort show
And I could almost like you
Now you're falling over
Now you're feeling hopeless
Now you're looking over your shoulder
Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's coming up behind you?
If you can ride the backlash
There's still time for a comeback
You don't have to lie down and die
But Lazarus only did it the one time
He couldn't face another try
And I could almost like you
Now it's really over
Now you've shown some weakness
Now you're looking over your shoulder
Who's gonna come and find you?
And who's coming up behind you?

Wake from your sleep
Breathe, keep breathing
You can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope that you choke

On the left, to the right
Pressure gridlock eye on the prize
On my knees finally
The irony is you saying please
If you sleep too long the fires go out
You dare to dream and we have no doubt
One ahead one behind
It's physical no cold fish apply
Junk in your words don't show in your face I wait for your face to break
Vicious and clean edge like a razor hunting the lazerblade
Its free to the sweet one the short and the brief one silence is dangerous
Show me illusion in all the confusion peculiar database
Open up what am I ?
It's all in the book babe line after line
Easily voice on the line soothe it to sooth you
Ice down my spine

There is a place where I can hide
He comes to meet me there
There in that hour, I can let go
Be myself once more
There in that place,
The waters flow
And the river runs, high
[Chorus]
I hear that still small voice
What is this call on my heart
I can be still in your care
You show me the way
Sometimes I'm scared to approach you
But slowly I get there
And realize I am home and
Wish I could stay, and more
Whisper your will in to my ear
And your perfume fills the air
[Chorus]

One more time with emotion
It's so delicate
When you're painting someone's heart
It's a little bit hard to be so eloquent
When you don't know where to start
I'll wait where the moonbeam hides
I'll wait on the other side
Away from the words I know
I'm waiting for your heart
I'm waiting for you heart to drop
One more time with some feeling
I'm not finished yet
I'm just trying to find the start
I try to say what I'm meaning
But nothing seems to fit
When I'm trying to fill your heart

Born under punchs, cross eyed and painless
Slippery people, I'm not In Love
Houses In Motion, a Road To Nowhere
Once In A Lifetime, I'm Not In Love
Don't Worry About The Government
The Democratic Circus
Cause Mommy Daddy You and I
Are Burning Down The House
Heeey! Heeeey! Heeeey! Heeey!
Psycho Killer, radiohead
Television Man, I'm Not In Love
Puzzling Evidence, Seen and Not Seen
This Must Be The Place
I'm Not In Love
Don't Worry 'Bout The Government
The Democratic Circus
Cause Mommy Daddy You and I
Are Burning Down The House
I Get wild, Wild Gravity
Wild Wild Life, The Big Country
Don't Worry 'Bout The Government
The Democratic Circus
Cause Mommy Daddy You and I
Are Burning Down The House

Wild Wild Life, The Big Country

Put your hand down, boy
Welcome to my zoo
Put your head inside
My big black wild while
I can still help you
See the snake-baboon
Funky, chic and smooth
Honey can you spy
The divine ape-swine
'Cause he can see you
I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted, too
Five fingers to black hooves
I'm a man, don't spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I'm crooked but upright
And all I ever want
Is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I said to the thing that I once was
I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I'm a man, don't spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I'm crooked but upright
To the left now, boy
Underneath the moon
By the thick tan sand
And the tall thin grass
One more thing for you
See the distant flume
In the sleepy dunes
Makes my nerves clench close
And my bones go cold
When I see that room
And all I ever want
Is just a little love
I set in birds into the pond
And all I ever want
Is breaking me apart
I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers, to black hooves
I'm a man, don't spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I'm crooked but upright

Sorrow sings
her kisses in silence
and adjusts the blinds to keep the light
from mocking everything I feel
She dances slowly
a silhouette upon the curtains
but her eyes seem to cry
only empty tears
I beg for comfort with inadequate verse
it meant so much to me.... and so little to her
and I am sinking into a mountain of self pity
why can't I simply disregard all the things I feel?
"where is my angel,"
"where is my angel,"
"where is my angel, when I need him most?"
"where is my angel,"
"where is my angel,"
"where is my angel, tell me now where did he go?"

Attack me with your love, baby
Hey
When you walk, when you pass me by
There's reasons that come immediately to mind
One is I'd like to have you, two is I love your face
The third one is irrelevant â??cause there's no time or place
Attack me with your love
Attack me with your love, baby (Attack me with your love)
Attack me with your love
Bushwhack me with your love, baby (And I'll do all the things you want me to)
Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby
I think you need to know the deal about just how I really feel
Cause intentionally I'm for real and I'm sure I'll make you feel
That I'm a mean man and I'm a go-getter (Ow)
Hey, baby, baby
Late at night when the evening comes
I sit down to check my options, there are none
First thing I think about is your lovely smile
And the things that drive me wild (Uh)
Got a little lady drivin' me crazy
What am I gonna do, woo-hoo
Got a little lady drivin' me crazy
What am I gonna do if I can't have you
Attack me with your love
Attack me with your love, baby
Attack me with your love
Bushwhack me with your love, baby (And I'll do all the things you want me to)
Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby (Oh)
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby
Hey, pretty lady (Lady)
There's no defense against your love
I want to show you how I feel
Hey, baby (Oh), baby
The night is young, here take this glass
We'll toast to happiness and a love that'll ever last
Of all the loves I've had before
No one can compare, to me you're so much more (Uh)
Baby, just let me do (Hey) what I want to do to you
I know I'll have you, woo-ooh
If you can let me know what I want to do to you
Then I'll wait for you (I'll wait for you), I'll wait for you
Attack
Attack, baby
Attack
Bushwhack, baby
Excite
Entice, baby
Come slap me
I'm happy, baby

You're a paradise
And I've landed on the
password
Am I paralyzed?
Cause I need you ever after
All the questioning
You are every single answer
I was shivering
You're the fireplace in winter
What I would not give to have
Here with me is all I ask
Be it as it may
You are every night
And every day
To me
Be it any way
You are everything
And anything
In me
You're my parachute
I can open when I'm falling
When I'm high on you
There could never be a
warning
You're my victory
When I lost all hope for
looking
I'm imagining
if it wasn't your loving

Sea Song
You look different every time
You come from the foam, crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
Partly fish, partly porpoise
Partly baby sperm whale
Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?
Joking apart, when you're drunk
You're terrific when you're drunk
I like you mostly late at night, you're quite alright
But I can't understand the different you in the morning
When it's time to play a being human for a while
We smile, we smile, we smile
You'll be different in the spring, I know
You're a seasonal beast
Like the starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own
My very own
We're not alone

Don't worry, dear Pamela
I'll do my scientific best to command your fleet
Don't worry, dear Pamela
I'll do my scientific best to command your fleet
Don't worry, dear Pamela
I'll do my scientific best to command your fleet
Don't worry, dear Pamela
I'll do my scientific best to command your fleet

I was with my girlfriend
This is [? ? ] florida
She took me to this place
It had al kind of things growing
She gave me something
It was a mushroom
She said "eat it", she said.
A mushroom, what is that?
She said "eat it".
I don't think she [? ? ]
She's kind of a wild girl
I don't think she was that wild
So i, I ate the mushroom
And I said "it doesn't taste like much"
She said "wait a minute"
So I waited a minute
I waited a few minutes
- filter -
And the next thing I know, I was walking on clouds
There were beautiful clouds
And my girlfriend was talking to me
While I was walking on the clouds
And everything felt beautiful
I almost felt like I didn't have any feet,
No floor under me
It was beautiful
We looked in each other eyes.
On top of these clouds
And we were talking with each other
With our mouths wide open
And all of a sudden
She let me go
But I didn't fall,
I floated, but I was far away from her.
Until the next thing I know she wasn't there,
Knows by myself.
And I was on gras again
- begin of track 6 -
Very soft gras
I walked to the gras (4x)

Where the doors are moaning all day long,
Where the stairs are leaning dusk 'till dawn,
Where the windows are breathing in the light,
Where the rooms are a collection of our lives,
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place that I call my home
This is a place that I call my home

[Verse 1]
We love golden chains, we love diamond rings
We could always gain them designer things
Versace, Prada, Rolex or Mercedes Benz
The grind will never end, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Got my eyes on the prize, but it won't mean much
Without you by my side
Yeah, we all fantasize 'bout our cash going up
But your love ain't got a price
[Hook]
With you, I'm tryna kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
Flip this, flip this thing up
[Hook]
Yeah, we flip this thing up
Kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
[Verse 2]
We love traveling, we love catching flights
We'll do anything to be in paradise
Ibiza or Bahamas just to live the life
But it's you that makes me feel alive
[Pre-Chorus]
Got my eyes on the prize, but it won't mean much
Without you by my side
Yeah, we all fantasize 'bout our cash going up
But your love ain't got a price
[Hook]
With you, I'm tryna kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
Flip this, flip this thing up
[Hook]
Yeah, we flip this thing up
Kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
Spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
[Bridge
If I ever played 'em on the lotto
I'd still want you with me here tomorrow
Lead me to your love and I would follow
Then I'll be a winner wherever I go
[Hook]
Kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it

Arabian queen right on the scene
Riding along in her cinematic dream
I am the queen of this harem
I got my veil on and I'm feeling serene
Arabian highs, bear the sundown sigh
Let's gather round the hookah
Blowing circles to the sky
Arabian dreams everybody seems ...
And she says ...
Hold on her heels taht swinging girl of sin
With her jewel-encrusted gown
And her belly swinging brown
Sold all her sins and everybody sway
Through the hazy days
With rubies on her toes everybody knows
She's the queen of the sand
The desert and the land
A breeze like mango kulli
A little hoochie koochie
And she says ...
Cocooned in silken shrouds
And jasmine scented clouds
She's the queen of the harem
You know who wears the crown
She teases and she sleazes
You know it never ceases
When she does her voodoo
(Sweet as almond honey
A lick of chunky monkey
She's sticky like jalebi
I don't wanna hear a maybe)

See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me
Huh
Huh
Huh
Falling in and out of love
In love, in love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love
See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me
Huh
Falling in and out of love
In love, in love, in love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love
Why can't you see it
Why can't you feel
In and out of love each time
Why can't you feel it
Why can't you see it
In and out of love
I keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Love is fade away
You keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Love is fade away
Keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Love is fade away
Huh
Away, away, away,
Away, let it fade away

[Chorus]
Got to get it got to get it out of my head
I think I expected too much of it
Got to get it got to get it out of my head
I know I wanted too much from it
Got to get it got to get it
Who needs to feel like that
Got to get it got to get it
Who needs to feel like that
Got to get it got to get it
Who needs to feel like that
Got to get it got to get it
Can't get you out of my head I try
Thoughts of you I just cannot defy
We must have had something real strong
I'm tossing turning all night long
Can't even enjoy a fantasy
Without your face jumping in a scene
Can't escape your grip cause you clutch my mind
Want to dream of other girls but you I find
Thought getting you out of my heart was hard
But now I see that was just the start
Your legacy is trying to drive me mad
To forget I concentrate on all the bad
Can't shake this monkey off my back
Tried drinking everything from beer to jack
No answers in all the books I've read
All I know is I've got to get you out of my head
[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah
Out of my thoughts let go my mind [Repeat: x7]
I'm gonna have to change this thing so let's stop it for a second
Okay let's do it
[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah
Chorus
Yeah yeah yeah

This is what I thought you said
Talking on the phone
Just walk away
And cry
Cause so long
The holidays we spent will fade
Now that I've been gone
Just remember
That we met
You're still at home
Listen to the voice that says alright
This is start and not the end tonight
You said that ?
Reach across the sky
? the windows
We stay
But not at home
Times like this you wonder why
It's even worth your while
Just count the silence
These days
Until you smile
Listen to the voice that says alright
This is start and not the end tonight
Listen to the voice that says alright
This is start and not the end tonight

People who are afraid of the dark
Send their children to bed
And stay out all night

And stay out all night

Everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
Everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
When it comes, it falls in pieces.
Eating holes and gems unbound.
Birds and hearts and flags and everything.
Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.
Money matters. Does mercy matter?
Suddenly, as things are clearer,
See the sights are getting nearer.
Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.

I learn to hold my, will power.

Where are you little cat?
I have not found you.
I guess I'm not good, at all.
Where are you little cat?
I won't see.
If you like it
Maybe, you should have not run away.
I don't hate you at all for it.
I don't get it.

In these days of confused situations
In this night of a restless remorse
When the heart and the soul of a nation
Lay wounded and cold as a corpse
From the grave of the innocent Adam
Comes a song bringing joy to the sad
Oh, your cry has been heard
and the ransom
Has been paid up in full, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Every debt that you've ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord
Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad
So be like lights on the rim of the water
Givin
g hope in a storm sea of night
Be a refuge amidst the slaughter
Of these fugitives in their flight
For you are timeless and part of a puzzle
You are winsome and young as a lad
And there is no disease or no struggle
That can pull you from God, be ye
glad
Oh, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Every debt that you ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord
Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Every debt that you ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grac
e of the Lord
Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad

You're the angel you're my queen
I do everthing for you
I protect you from the cold
You can give me what I need
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted to this game
You give me pleasures give me pain
You're the onlyone I need
You're the master I'm your slave
We can reach eternity
Please don't ever let me go
You know I'm your property
And we're running through the night
You're the angel of my dreams
From the darkness into light
I'll follow you
We're searching for a place to hide
A silent place for me and you
We leave everything behind
No one can find us
I love the way you make me feel
When you kiss me in the night
You know my soul belongs to you
And please keep it when you die
I see tears in your eyes
But you kiss me with a smile
Your skin is cold you close your eyes
I can feel you fade away

You are a dream that burns inside.
A magic potion, that's my soul.

Apron strings
Hanging empty
Crazy things
My body tells me
I want someone to tie to my lonely
Apron strings
Apron strings
Waiting for you
Pretty things
That I could call you
I want someone to tie to my lonely
Apron strings
He'd look just like me when I was young
And I wonder as the days unwind
Will he have your eyes or mine
Then I wake up to my
Apron strings
Cold and lonely
For time brings
Thoughts that only
Will be quiet when someone clings to my
Apron strings
And I'll be perfect in my own way
When you cry I'll be there
I'll sing to you and comb your hair
All your troubles I will share

If you could see me here this way
Looking backwards from today
Would you do it all again
If I could roll it back to you
Just like lovers always do
I'm stoned in love but not with you
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love
If we could wash the past away
Would we go our separate ways
I'll do it all again, as if I care
Is this the way it's meant to be
Stoned in love but not with me
You're stoned in love in love me
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love
Stoned in love...
I'm stoned in love love but not with you
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love
It's how I'm feeling now
I feel the love is made of stone
We're not feeling stoned in love
Stoned in love
Stoned in love but not with you
As if I care

In the next world war, in a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign, scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car, I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

I'm lost in daydreams
In the sierra of my lonely mind
And the sun has no mercy
Ai Mi Amor I feel blind
Far in the distance
I can still see you waving good bye
Oh Senor please forgive me
But your heart of stone can't hear me cry
Dir me Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Mi Amante
Baby Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay - Corazon
Dir me Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Mi Amante
Baby Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay - Mi Amor
Don't you remember
When we found the oasis of light
In the shadows of passion
Our hearts were trying to hide
We drank the waters
Of a fountain so sweet and so cool
It was heaven Muchacho
Yet one of us broke the rule
Tu - Tu you can't love me estranjero
I tell you sincero
Yes you will hate me if you do
Tu - Ay ay ay ay ay
Tu - You're my fantasy Dorada
It's over - De Nada
And I know that you know it too
Tu Ay ay ay ay ay
Tu

You don't need many words
To leave me breathless
Only one off your tongue
The sweet sound that calms
The aching in my soul
You enter languid
As you shape your tones
You leave me breathless
You leave me breathless
I want to know if a soul will show to grow
Grow in my garden
Sow up the hardened soil of forgotten love
I want to know if a soul will show to grow
Grow in my garden
Sow up the hardened soil of forgotten love
Some days have passed me by
I'm still awake in the night
So much time
Spent waiting for this
Moment to come
What is there to fear?
The dream's clearly seen
It's the end of unbridled years
The end of unnecessary fear
I want to know if a soul will show to grow
Grow in my garden
Sow up the hardened soil of forgotten love
I want to know if a soul will show to grow
Grow in my garden
Sow up the hardened soil of forgotten love
I felt one day I was closer to love than I ever came
I was sure there was no mistake
And there I was all wrong again
The only thing for sure is that I'd been forgotten
I was swept away
I want to know if a soul will show to grow
Grow in my garden
Sow up the hardened soil of forgotten love
I want to know if a soul will show to grow
Grow in my garden
Sow up the hardened soil of forgotten love

ohh yeah
got your voicemail that you left
and it's steady on repeat
why am I so obsessive
still wishing we could be
and I know it makes no sense
cos of what you did to me
was the most bullshit someone could ever do
it's ridiculous
it's been months
for some reason I just
can't get over us
was I always in denial
but enough is enough
no more sitting here thinkin bout you
thought I could get over you but I don't know how to do it
and I'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't I turn off the radio
iphone steady getting calls
but it don't matter at all
I tried to jump but I just can't fall
so I stay rejecting calls
I just miss those 3 little words (I love you)
is the part that hurts the worse
can I never find someone like you again
and I'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't I turn off the radio
leave me alone
to claim my top thrown
no more thinkin bout our sex
I know I did it better than the rest
how I put those thoughts to bed
for the very last time
and I'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't I turn off the radio
no no no
and I'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't I turn off the radio
said I'm so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
so done with wishing you were still here
said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
so why can't I turn off the radio
why can't I turn off the radio

Clouds above go sailing by
I found my meaning in this life
Clear white is flying in my eyes,
Underneath a blue, blue sky
The waves come rolling in with the tide.
I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more.
You look like you did before,
Only prettier.
Every day I love you more.
All the people rushing by, by, by
Looking for meaning in this life
So used up, and blinded by lies,
They're underneath the blue, blue sky
The way they seldom seem to smile,
I don't know why.
'Cause I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more.
You look like you did before,
Only prettier
Every day I love you more
I love you more,
Everyday I love you more,
And more
Cause I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more.
You look like you did before,
Only prettier.
And every day I missed you more,
And more and more and more and more.
I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more.
Oh you look like you did before,
Only prettier
Everyday I love you more.

I was waiting for you to release me
I been hanging around for a minute
Baby, don't give me you, it won't hurt me
I don't even know if you deserve me
But with that moon in the sky
Who wants to be alone
And when the stars shine so bright
Who wants to be alone
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Right next to me
You wanna be
Till the sun comes up
I am goin' nowhere in a hurry
Baby, come take away all my worries
But with that moon in the sky
Who wants to be alone
And when the stars shine so bright
Who wants to be alone
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Right next to me
You wanna be
Till the sun comes up
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
But with that moon in the sky
Who wants to be alone
And when the stars shine so bright
Who wants to be alone
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Don't take me home till the sun comes up
Till the sun comes up
Right next to me
You wanna be
Till the sun comes up
