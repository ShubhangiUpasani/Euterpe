You have a love that buys you pretty clothes
All the fine things heaven only knows that I wish I could
You have a love that dances and sings
Swings, says all the pretty little things that a playboy should
Well, he's got money, he's got charms
And when you're walkin' on and on
It hurts me so, but I just want you to know
That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And wish the best to you, push myself aside
And that's the greatest love, oh, that you'll ever find
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You have a love, he's got the power
To entertain each and every hour of the day and night
You have a love, he's got the ways and means
To show you all the wild scenes when the lights are bright
Well, love should never be possessed
And this my darlin', don't forget
You're free to go, oh, but I just want you to know
That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And I wish the best to you and I push myself aside
That's the greatest love, oh, that you'll ever find
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Well, love should never be possessed
And this my darlin', don't forget
You're free to go, oh, but I just want you to know
That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And I wish the best to you, push myself aside
That's the greatest love, oh, that you'll ever find
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I can smell the scent of fresh cut grass
You know it kind of took me back
To yesterday when we was young, oh so young
I remember we were so scared
To even hold each other's hands
But still we fell so deep in love
When did it start to rain
How did things get so strange
When did it go astray
[Chorus:]
'Cause you don't love or want me
Sometimes I think that you don't know me
I just ned for you to show me
Oh like you used to do
Like you used to do
You were my Weezy, you were my Boo
You was my Thelma, damn I was into you
Why can't it be that way again baby
You were my Marvin, my Billy Dee
Oh baby my, my, my sweet melody
Why can't you play that music today
I want to play baby
When did it start to rain
How did things get so strange
When did it go astray
Girl you don't want me, need me
Girl you don't even try to please me
I would if you would squeeze me
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
You don't hear me, you don't feel me
Sometimes I think you don't even see me
Well girl I would if you believed in me yeah
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
When we gonna do it like we used to
When we gonna do it
Like you used to do
When we gonna do it like we used to do
When we gonna do it
Tell me when did it start to rain
How did things get so strange baby
When did it go astray
I want to know when did it start to rain
How did things get so strange baby
I want to know, I want to know
[Chorus:]
Well you don't hear me, you don't feel me
Sometimes I think that you don't see me
Well girl I would if you believed in me yeah
Like you used to do
When we gonna do it like we used to do
When we gonna do it
Like you used to do
When we gonna do it like we used to do
When we gonna do it

There's something that rules our destiny
Right from the first day of our birth
although you may not care for me
You have your mission on this earth
You were born to love
Sure as you live
Born with everything heaven could give
You have eyes and they express
Love at a glance
You have lips who's tenderness
Speak of romance
Like a dream of love, lovely to see
You're the angel of my destiny
And to think that you have found
Your place on earth only to be
Born to love and be loved by me

And when my burden seems hard to bare
And there is no one to help me share
I just call on King Jesus
And I know he'll surely hear
You know He took my load away
And I begin to say
Just a little more faith and grace is all I need
Jesus Is all I need
Well...
That's all... that's all I need
When I cannot see my way
Ohhh.that's all... that's all I need
To help me run the race
That's all... all I need
When I cannot see my way
Just a little more faith & grace
That's all I need... Jesus is all I need
You know That is the key to the kingdom
You know faith can unlock the door
I just call Him every morning
The strength I need as I go
Oh, He'll give you what you need
Oh, If you'll only just believe
Just a little more faith & grace
All I need. Jesus is all I need.

Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo
(Help me)
Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo...
Sometimes,
Sometimes I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
I feel all by myself up here
That's when I take a minute
To re-evaluate things
All of the things I think are special
Oooh like
When you wake up in the morning
And you see the morning sun
And you need to know the world is on your side
Who do you run to
Who can you turn to
Come on
Then the evening comes to greet you
You need someone to hold you close
And you feel you need to rest your aching mind
Who can you run to
Who can you turn to
Well see the sun's in the east and the moon reflects
Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest
If you want to go to heaven lay up on my breast
I'm ye yo, you're ye yo
I say the sun's in the east and the moon reflects
Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest
If you want to go to heaven lay up on my breast
I'm ye yo, you're ye yo
Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo.....

Big house, big car, back seat, full bar
Houseboat won't float, bank won't tote the note
Too much stuff, there's just too much stuff
It'll hang you up dealing with too much stuff
Hangin' out on the couch puttin' on the pounds
Better walk, run, jump, swim, try to hold it down
You're eatin' too much stuff, too much stuff
It'll wear you down, carrying around too much stuff
Hundred dollar cab ride, fogged in, can't fly
Greyhound, Amtrak, oughta bought a Cadillac
Too much stuff, too much stuff
It'll slow you down, fooling with too much stuff
Well, it's way too much
You're never gonna get enough
You can pile it high
But you'll never be satisfied
Rent-a-tux, shiny shoes, backstage, big schmooze
Vocal group can't sing, won awards for everything
Too much stuff, too much stuff
They just keep on going, rolling in all that stuff
Got hurt, can't work, got a lot o' bills
But the policy don't pay 'less I get killed
Too much stuff, too much stuff
Just my luck, counting on too much stuff
Well, it's way too much
You're never gonna get enough
You can pile it high
But you'll never be satisfied
Running back can't score till he gets a million more
Quarterback can't pass, owner wants his money back
Too much stuff, too much stuff
You know, you can't get a grip when you're slipping in all that stuff
Women every which-a-way messing with my mind
You know, I fall in love every day three or four times
Too much stuff, too much stuff
It'll mess you up, fooling with too much stuff
Yeah, too much stuff, too much stuff
Too much stuff, too much stuff
You never get enough 'cause there's just too much stuff
You know you can hurt yourself, fooling with too much stuff
Yeah, it'll tear you down, fooling with all that stuff

When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed,
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done
Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend
There they are, they fell in love,
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart
Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

[Chorus:]
Going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)
I said I'm going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)
I've got to get back to my baby
And take her in my arms again
I've got to get back to my baby
I ain't seen her since I don't know when
Got to get back now to Florida
Lay out in the morning Sun
Got to get back to Miami
Have a whole lotta fun
[Chorus]
Look out
[Chorus]
Gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
I gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
Gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
Gotta gotta gotta get back (Gotta gotta gotta get back)
Look out!
Chicago, Illinois
Los Angeles, California
Philadelphia P.A.
San Francisco
New York, New York
Dallas, Texas
Atlanta, Georgia
[Chorus]

When the words came tumbling out of my mouth
I felt it all goin' south
But I kept on talkin', 'til you started walking
Now I'm trying to dig my way out
Ain't I got a right to be wrong?
I can't believe you're so long gone
Why can't you just come on home?
Ain't I got a right, ain't I got a right to be wrong?
You know I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry for what I put you through
As much as I regret it, you won't let me forget it
Baby, what you trying to do?
Ain't I got the right to be wrong?
I can't believe you're so long gone
Why can't you just come on home?
Ain't I got a right, ain't I got a right to be wrong?

I love you I love you said the little blue man, I love you I love you to bits. I love you I love you said the little blue man, and scared me right out of my wits.

Sing a song of sad young men, glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again, kiss your dreams goodbye
All the sad young men sitting in the bars
Knowing neon lights missing all the stars
All the sad young men drifting through the town
Drinking up the night, trying not to drown
All the sad young men singing in the cold
Trying to forget that they are growing old
All the sad young men choking on their words
Trying to be brave, running from the truth
Autumn turns the leaves to gold, slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old that's the cruelest part
All the sad young men seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold for a little while
Tired little girl does the best she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man
While the grimy moon watches from up above
All the sad young men play of making love
Misbegotten moon shine for sad young men
May your gentle light guide them home tonight
All the sad young men

Tall trees in Georgia they grow so high they shade me so
And sadly walking through the thicket I go
The sweetest love I ever had I left aside
Because I did not want to be any man's bride
But now I'm older and married I would be
I found my sweetheart but he would not marry me
When I was younger the boys all came around
But now I'm older and they've all settled down
Control your mind my girl and give your heart to one
For if you love all men you'll be surely left with none
Tall trees in Georgia they grow so high they shade me so
And sadly walking through the thicket I go

I never knew why I loved you so much
Maybe it's the way you look at me
When you get up in the morning
I didn't need a shove, I just fell in love
With your little baby face, oh yeah
Baby face
You got the prettiest little baby face
There isn't another one to take your place
Baby face
You got my heart a jumpin'
You sure have started something
Baby face
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove 'coz I just fell in love
With your pretty little baby face
You got my heart a jumpin'
You sure have started something
Baby face
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove, I just fell in love
With your pretty little baby face
Pretty little baby face, pretty little baby face

My love what did I do to make you fall so far from me
And how, I can't recall cause of the fall selected memory
Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall
So I couldn't see
If I get off my knees I might recall I'm 20 feet tall.
Ooh, eh
I'm 20 feet tall
Ooh, eh
I'm 20 feet tall
My love what did I do to make you fall so far from me
And how, I can't recall cause of the fall selected memory
Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall
So I couldn't see
If I get off my knees I might recall I'm 20 feet tall.
Ooh, eh
I'm 20 feet tall
Ooh, eh
I'm 20 feet tall

It was just imagination
The temptation
That went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
You've beat me to the girl that I always wanted
Thought you had her, brother, but you still don't own her
Because I'm not through
And there's nothing you can do (there is nothing you can do)
You never had her
She took you for a ride (she took you for a ride)
I know that it's a fact that you sneak behind my back
Smiled in my face and deceived me with your lies, but I'm not through
Oh, there's nothing you can do (there is nothing you can do)
You never had her
Oh, no, she took you for a ride (she took you for a ride)
But this is the part that you knew nothing of
She confessed to me that she toyed with your love
You were just a game that she loved to play
You never had her
Oh, no, she took you for a ride
All of her ecstasy that you had
Was just imagination
The temptation
That went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
You had her, brother, you were my guest
You pawned your broken heart just like all the rest and now you are through
And there's nothing you can do (there is nothing you can do)
You never had her
No, no, she took you for a ride (she took you for a ride)
Was just imagination
The temptation
That went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
She took you for a ride
She, a r-i-i-ide

Struttin down the street, got rhythm in your shoes
Shufflin' away the blues, Mister Tap Toe
You haven't any time to lose, Mister Tap Toe
Who's the gal you're gonna choose
New straw hat with a candy bar stripe
Sharper than an old tin-type, Mister Tap Toe
The melon on the vine is ripe, Mister Tap Toe
Who you takin out tonight
Where did you get your fancy clothes
The pretty hand painted tie
Cigar stickin' out from under your chapeau
Who're you gonna dance with tonight, Mister Tap Toe
Give a gal a break, I gotta dress that's new
The pavement's big enough for two, Mister Tap Toe
To dance along aside of you, Mister Tap Toe
Tell me what you're gonna do
(Watcha gonna do, Mister Tap Toe)

No summer nights to make me dream as I do

One thing would still be true
My heart reminds me I love you

The music is the magic of a secret world
Secret world, a secret world
It's a world that is always within
The music is the magic and the hiding place
The hiding place, the hiding place
The music is the magic and the hiding place
It's a place where the spirit is home
The music is the magic of a sacred world
Sacred world, a sacred world
The music is the magic of a sacred world
It's a world that is always within
The music is the magic through a raging storm
A raging storm, raging storm
The music is the magic through the raging storm
The storm that is over again

There has been times in my life
When the ground was so cold
Cant find a friend anywhere at all
So my brother said to me
John you got to stand tall
Because life, is full of sorrow and heartaches and pain
Again and again
I woke up this morning, my Mama she was crying
So I looked out my window
Police lights were flashing
People were screaming
So I ran down to the street
A friend grabbed my shoulder and
He said to these words to me
Life is full of sorrow
So I have to tell you this, your brother is gone
Heartaches and pain
Heartaches and pain
Woo woo woo oh oh na na na
Heartaches and pain
oh oh
Heartaches and pain
No no no
Heartaches and pain......

Circle 'Round the Moon
Invites me to stay out in the wintertime
Crystals in the air suggest that I prepare
for the cold night air
High above the trees
you will make me see
that with such a sight
Sheer delight
is hidden everywhere
for those who care to see
Caverns down below
Invite me to come down on the slippery rock
Icicles of stone
and horrid mountain gnomes
hidden in the dark
In the ground below
you will make me know that with such a sight
sheer delight is hidden everywhere
for those who care to see
what great mind behind it
dreamed it and designed it
pale moons cavern tombs
starry starry sky
Flurry blizzard snow
watch it as it blows
in the cool gray skies
sandy summer beach
hear the seagulls screech
in the hot dry air
what great mind behind it
dreamed it and designed it
snowy night summer flight
painful beauty in my sight
making me long for you

Yes, I've been around and I watch you, baby
I know you're the one
And I see you and I cry inside, baby
The moment has come-but I
I try to hide what I'm feeling, baby
Don't want you to know
It's a feeling so deep in my heart, baby
I can't let it go, yes
No one to blame
If I miss this, sho would be shame
No one to blame, baby it
Sho is a shame
There ain't no reason to doubt me, baby
You know I don't lie
And I tell you from deep in my heart, baby
I'm willin' to try, yes I am
This ain't no game that I'm playin', baby
Our love is for real
And I tell you I know that it's strong
I know what I feel, yes
No one to blame, baby
If I miss this, sho would be shame
No one to blame, darlin' if
I miss this, sho is a shame
No one to blame, baby
Sho is a shame
My baby life offers no prize, no guarantees
Baby, for missed opportunities
And I can't let you walk by
I've got to try, tellin' you I know it's right
It's the truth, don't you lie, baby-yes
You know that I tried to resist you, baby
But I'm losin' my fight
I mean this, I really do mean this, baby
You know that I'm tell you no lies
This ain't no game that I'm playing', darlin'
This thing is for real
And I want you to know that it's strong
I know what I feel
No one to blame, baby
Ad lib

Frisco Flo was just a typical gal,
Frisco Flo was just a regular my-gal-Sal;
Frisco Flo was just as sharp as a tack;
Frisco Flo, for a fellow would give the shirt right off of her back.
She knew the smallies and the biggies, the weak and the strong,
A sinner, no beginner, at kicking the gong,
But with it all, she always knew the right from the wrong.
Love thy neighbor was her favorite song!
Frisco Flo is up in heaven, I know,
Here below,
We love the memory of Frisco Flo.
Though she's gone, we go on,
Like a flame, we carry onward in the name of Frisco Flo!

Gonna sit right down in my easy chair
Pull out a deck of cards, play some solitaire
Break out a bottle, wash me a glass
To keep me company 'til the feelings pass
Everybody needs something to do
Me, I'll just sit here and think about you
It might seem hopeless, but it ain't that bad yet
It's just the blues as blues can get...
I need to call somebody, someone I can trust
I need the number for lovers' anonymous
I'll tell 'em my story, hope they understand
Maybe they can explain it to me
'Cause I don't think I can
I'll take your picture down from my wall
Try to remember the thrill of it all
I know it's over, but it ain't over yet
It's just the blues as blues can get...
Why fight the feeling when I can't fight back the tears
I stare at the ceiling and wish that you were here
I'm going crazy, but I ain't crazy yet
It's just the blues as blues can get...

Spending my vacation in the summer sun
Gettin' lots of action and a lots of fun
Scorin' like a bandit 'til the bubble burst
Suddenly it got to be September First
Woe is me
All summer long I was happy and free
Save my soul
The board of education took away my parole
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there 'til then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go, back to school again
Geometry and History is just a pain
Biology and Chemistry destroys my brain
Well, don't they know that I deserve a better fate
I'm really much too young to matriculate
Well, mama please
Your child's come down with a fatal disease
Mama said
"Come on you lazy bum now get your butt out of bed"
You gotta go back, back, back to school again
It's bye, bye fun, get your homework done
You better be in by ten
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go, back to school again
I got my books together and I dragged my feet
And then I saw this angel boppin' down the street
I said, "Hey, pretty baby, hows about a date?"
She said, "I'm going to school and I can't be late"
Well, I can see
That look in her eyes was sayin' 'Follow me'
And I was caught
I thought of playing hooky but on second thought
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there 'til then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go back to school again

If I cal three times a day baby
Come and drive my blue away
When you come,be ready to play
Do your duty
If you want to have some love
Give your baby your last buck
Don't come quackin' like a duck
Do your duty
I heard you said you didn't love me,baby
Down at
I don't believe a word she said
She's the lyinest woman in town
Oh babe,when I need attention at home
I'll just call you on the telephone
Come yourself,don't send your friend Jones
Do your duty
If my radiator gets too hot
Cool it off in lots of spots
Give me all the service you've got
Do your duty
If you don't know what it's all about
Don't sit around my house and pout
If you do you'll catch your mama tippin' now
Do your duty
If you make your own bed hard
That's the way it lies
I'm tired of sleepin' by myself
But you're too dumb to realize
I'm not tryin' to make you feel blue
I'm not satisfied with the way you do
I've got to help you find somebody too
Do your duty
Do your duty

The season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living
The Christmas time when I was young,
The magic and the wonder,
But colors dull and candles dim,
And dark my standing under
O little Zachary, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning
A Savior King was born that day,
A baby just like you,
And as the Magi came with gifts,
I come with my gift too
That peace on Earth fills up your time,
That brotherhood surrounds you.
That you may know the warmth of love,
And wrap it all around you
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone

Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearin' two by two
On an evenin' in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso, yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl, I wish I knew
On an evenin' in Roma
Though there's grinin' and mandolinin' in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun
When the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that is one too few
On an evenin' in Roma
Don't know what the country's comin' to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evenin' in Roma?
Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun
When the sun goes down
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Don't know what the country's comin' to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evenin' in Roma?
Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evenin' in Roma

Too many, too many mornings
Gotta wake up soon
Too many, too many mornings, whoa Lord gotta wake up soon
Oh, and eat my breakfast by the light of the moon
It was late, very late last summer
When I first got my time
Whoa it was late, very, very late last summer
You know when I first got my time
My buddy got one hundred years, thank the Lord I just got ninety-nine
If you see, if you see my mama
Won't you tell her this for me?
Lord, if you see, if you see my dear old mother
Won't you please tell her this for me?
I got a long, long time and Lord knows when I'm gonna be free
You know they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin'
But you know that they won't last long
Lord, they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin'
But you know that they won't last long
One day they're gonna wish they was a baby boy in their mothers' arms
You know they're always, always talking about dangerous blue
Whoa, you know they're always talking about dangerous blue
If I had my big old pistol, you know I'd be dangerous too
Twelve jury men found me guilt
The doorman looked me up and down
Lord, twelve jury men found me guilty
You know the doorman looked me up and down
Just looked at me through the corner of his eye and said "boy
You're penitentiary-bound"
One day, one day down in New Orleans
All the girls gonna jump and shout
Lord, one day down in New Orleans all the girls gonna jump and shout
When them big green gates open up wide
I'll come steppin' out

We met one evening when the moon was bright,
And when she gave me the eye I thought that I would die,
She had such curly hair and teeth of white,
And I learned about love from her.
And when she'd hold me in her arms so tight,
Every kiss was like a torch, my lips, they used to scorch,
That gal was just a mess of dynamite!
And I learned about love from her.
You've heard about that man from Tennessee,
Say, he came along one day and he stole my gal away;
Now she's teaching him what she taught me,
When I learned about love from her.
At night I sit alone so sad and blue,
Like a monkey on the shelf; say, I could hang myself!
There's a gang of things I didn't learn to do
When I learned about love from her.
Went to school, went to school, just to learn the game of love,
Once a fool, stays a fool, that's one thing I'm certain of,
There's no one beneath the Sun, beneath this sky above
Who can tell upon a given Sunday where his gal will be on Monday.
Now my gal and I are far apart
And with teardrops in my eyes, say, I realize
I didn't learn how to mend a busted heart
When I learned about love from her!

I saw someone again today who remembered me and you
They asked all the same old questions, I gave the same excuse
They said, "What a shame, what a shame, to lose a love so fine"
But I never lost you, I never lost you
I never lost you, you were never mine
I kept on believing what I wanted to believe
The unspoken promises that you could never keep
But it's a sin, oh, it's a sin to tell yourself a lie
I never lost you, I never lost you
I never lost you, you were never mine
Did you give me all that you gave me just because I needed you
But when I needed, all your love completely was it more than you could do
Sometimes deep in the night when I hold you in my dreams
I get lost in your loving touch, baby, I can't believe how real it seems
And I know, yes I know, I'll have you till the end of time
'Cause I never lost you, I never really lost you
I never lost you 'cause you were never mine
I never lost you, I never really lost you
How could I lose you, you were never mine

If I had a penny
For every time I caught you
Undressing me with your eyes
I'd be a rich one and then
I could prove all my senses
Were real all along
You wanted me too
Though now you laugh
And call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you
If I could remember
All the things you used to say
When we were left alone
I'd have a book of sonnets
So inspired
All the muses would cringe
At your denial
At how you wanted me too
Though now you laugh
And call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you
Before she got to you
I would say
That we were something special
To behold
But now it's over, all over
before she came barging through
We were prime
To make the kind of love
As scarce as four leaf clover
Now, I'm a bit confused
'Cause what I felt
I thought was true
Did she barge in
And steal your heart away?
Or did you know
From the first day
I was just someone to play?
If so, damn that's cold
Before she got to you
I would say
That we were something special
To behold
But now it's over, all over
Before she came barging through
We were prime
To make the kind of love
As scarce as four leaf clover
If I could understand
What you have found in her
More than you
Could have had with me
I'd finally understand a mind
As twisted as yours
Must be for you to go
Just when you wanted me too
Though now you laugh
And call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
What kind of spell
Has she put on you?
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you
Before she got to you

Trouble may hound us, shadows surround us
Never mind, my Dear
Don't be downhearted, when we get started
They will disappear
Listen to Brother, while we've each other
There's no need to fear
For like Hansel and Gretel
We will prove our mettle
If you'll hang on to me while I hang on to you
We'll dance into the sunshine out of the rain
Forever and a day
Don't sigh, we'll get along, just try humming a song
And my, soon we shall hear the bluebird again
That's right, hold tight
We're on our way
Uphill, until
We lose the shadows
If you'll hang on to me (doo-doo)
While I hang on to you (doo-doo)
We'll dance into the sunshine out of the rain
That's right, hold tight
We're on our way
Uphill, until
We lose the shadows
If you'll hang on to me (doo-doo)
While I hang on to you (ooh-ooh)
We'll dance into the sunshine out of the rain
Forever and a day
We'll make a cabaret
That's all I've got to say

Way down on the levee in old Alabamy
There's daddy and mammy, there's Efran and Sammy
On a moonlight night you can find them all
While they are waiting the banjos are syncopating
What's that they're saying, what's that they're saying
Well while they keep playing I'm humming and swaying
It's the good ship Robert E. Lee that's come to carry the cotton away
Watch them shuffle along
See them shuffle along
Oh take your best gal real pal go down to the levee
I said the levee
Join the shuffling throng
Hear the music and song
It's simply great mate waiting on the levee
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee
Whistles are blowing smokestacks are showing
The ropes they are throwing, excuse me I'm going
To the place where all is harmonious
Even the preacher they say is the dancing teacher
Have you been down there say were you around there
If you ever go there you'll always be found there
Why doggone here comes my baby on the good ship Robert E. Lee
Watch them shuffle along
See them shuffle along
Oh take your best gal your real pal go down to the levee
I said the levee
Join the shuffling throng
Hear the music and song
It's simply great mate waiting on the levee
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee

It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year 'round
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along
Oh, it's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world
It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
(Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees)
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world

There's an old superstition 'way down south
Everybody believes that trouble won't stay
If you shake it away
When they hold a revival way down south
Everybody with care and trouble that day
Tries to shake it away
Shaking the blues away, unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles
Telling the blues to go, they may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake them away
Do like the voodoos do, listening to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so, to and fro
With every shake, a lucky break
Proving that there's a way to chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
Shaking the blues away, unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles
Telling the blues to go, they may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake them away
Do like the voodoos do, listening to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so, to and fro
With every shake, a lucky break
Proving that there's a way to chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
Gotta chase those cares away
Just to prove that there's a way
A way to shake shake your blues away

A little dream castle with every dream gone
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale
The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
Our beautiful garden has withered away
Where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say
A cottage for sale
From every single window, I see your face
But when I reach a window, there's an empty space
The key's in the mailbox, the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is told on the door
A cottage for sale
From every single window, I see your face
But when I reach a window, there's an empty space
The key's in the mailbox, the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is told on the door
A cottage for sale, for sale
A cottage for sale

Narrow daylight entered my room
Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?
I walked through halls of reputation
Among the infamous too
As the camera clings to the common thread
Beyond all vanity
Into a gaze to shoot you through
Is the kindness we count upon
Hidden in everyone?
I stepped out in a sunlit grove
Although deep down I wished it would rain
Washing away all the sadness and tears
That will never fall so heavily again
Is the kindness we count upon
Is hidden in everyone
I stood there in the salt spray air
Felt wind sweeping over my face
I ran up through the rocks to the old
Wooden cross
It's a place where I can find some peace
Narrow daylight entered my room
Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?

Willie, take your little drum
Robin bring your fife and come
When we play the fife and drum
Tu-re-lu-re-lu
Pat-a-pat-a-pan
When we play the fife and drum
Christmas shall very joyful be
Like the men of olden days
Who the king of kings did praise
With the sound of fife and drum
Tu-re-lu-re-lu
Pat-a-pat-a-pan
With the sound of fife and drum
To the Lord we shall bring our praise
While shepherds watched their sheep by night
Glad tidings brought and angel bright
How great their joy
Joy Joy Joy
Glory to God in Heaven on high
'Fear not at all,' He said to them
'Jesus is born in Bethlehem.'
How great their joy
Joy Joy Joy
Glory to God in Heaven on high
Jesus we hasten to adore
Grant us thy blessing ever more
How great their joy
Joy Joy Joy
Glory to God in Heaven on high

Here it is, baby
Your own special love song
All about what it's like
Just being with you
Like touching your lips
With the tips of my fingers
Looking up close
In your big eyes of blue
Now it's been a long time
Since I heard a love song
One that says
What I want to say to you
Now, I wrote one down
It may sound mushy
It may sound mushy
Oh, but, baby, it's true
Here it is baby
Your own special love song
All about what it's like
Being with you
Like touchin' your lips
With the tips of my fingers
Looking up close
In your big eyes of blue

St. Louis woman, she's never pleased,
She says there's one good man who'll soon be deceived,
If she can't hear from him each night at least
Six or seven times.
She says the other songs don't mean a thing,
There's only one that makes her heart go bing,
That's why she craves that little tune I sing
Six or seven times.

Bless the losers
Gods lost children
The drunks the fools
The ones that never do win
Huddled with their backs
Turned to the cold wind
Seeking any shelter
From their pain
Bless the winners
Always doin'
The gifted few
The ones that always will win
Huddled with their backs
Turned to their old friends
Busy seeking any shelter
From the rain
Bless the dreamers
Always searchin'
With their eyes wide open
Seekin' any answers
While huddled with their backs
Turned all the others
Lord their gains their loss for now
They have no questions
Bless the old ones
With their children
Busy now with children
Of their own
Huddled with their backs
Turned to the cold wind
Seeking any shelter
Bless us all

A man can walk proudly,
Down in the street.
A man's not ashamed of what he believes.
He knows how to laugh,
He knows when to cry.
He knows it's best to live.
He's afraid to die.
What is a man,
What is a man?
What is a man,
What is a man?
A man searches,
For the key to success.
He'd rather be sure,
Than take a wild guess.
He knows how to love,
He knows how to hate.
He knows when to move.
He knows just when to wait.
What is a man,
What is a man?
What is a man,
What is a man?
A man can be angry,
& still hold his tongue
A man don't give up
Till the battle is won.
He knows how to win,
He's not ashamed to lose.
He knows his destiny
is his alone to choose
What is a man,
What is a man?
What is a man,
What is a man?
What is a man,
What is a man?
What is a man,
What is a man?
Just what is a man?

There's bills to pay and planes to catch
And my socks just never seem to match
But I'm alright
And every night I lie awake
And think I've taken all that I can take
But I'm alright
Just when I think that I'll break
From all the bending I take
The thought of you pulls me through
And then I count my blessings
Count up all my dreams come true
I'm gonna count my blessings
And when I count my blessings
They all add up to you
2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4
Every night the news is bad
While the rich get richer and the poor get had
But I'm alright
And the threat of war is in the air
While the wise men try to lead us there
But I'm alright
And just when all hope is lost
Too many rivers to cross
I come running to you
I've got to count my blessings
Count up all my dreams come true
I'm gonna count my blessings
And when I count my blessings
They all add up to you
2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4
Just when I think that I'll break
From all the bending I take
The thought of you pulls me through
Count my blessings
Count my blessings
And just when all hope is lost
Too many rivers to cross
I come running to you
I've got to count my blessings
Count up all my dreams come true
I'm gonna count my blessings
And when I count my blessings
They all add up to you
Count my blessings
And count up all my dreams come true
I'm gonna count my blessings
And when I count my blessings
They all add up to you
Count my blessings
And count up all my dreams come true
I'm gonna count my blessings
And when I count my blessings
They all add up to you

Do you know that it was
By design
How you told me, told me,
Told me
That you were free and
It was by design
How you wiggle, wiggle,
Start to wiggle
When you're just walking by me
And it was by design
How you offered me just to walk
On down the road
I think that love,
Love was by design
Raggedy Ann
And it was by design
Sunny fields and mansions just
Behind your eyes
Lady lace and velvet passion
Burning just behind your eyes
It was by design how you
Conquered me
And on a fiery star we rose
I think that love, was your love,
By design
Little Miss Raggedy Ann
Would you, could you take me?
Let me fall by the wayside
Take me in your arms
Girl, you got the way to
Make me love you
You got the way to make
Me care
Like I never cared before,
Got the way
Take me, Ann, let me fall
Little Miss Raggedy Ann
I'll be your man, if I can
Oh, baby, I'm going to be
Your man

Let me go peacefully
In the brisk of silence
Let my heart rest
On a whole note
Let me go peacefully
No more fighting
No more name calling
No more hating
Wishful thinking
Me and you
To be loved by you
Boy meets girl
And falls in love
Lost for words
Deep in thought
Out of time
I'm in to you
Needing you to need me
I you we is but a dream
To hold you
To love you
In a gentle way
To be there for me
Until our dying days
To know you care for me
When I'm low
Love heals the pain
I fear the fear
To die alone
Let me go peacefully
In the brisk of silence
Let my heart rest
On a whole note
Let me go peacefully
My last wish to you, to God, to us
If I must die
Let's rest peacefully
With my voice
My last note
to carry on
You've all I got
With we,
are not alone

It's after midnight, don't need no street light
'Cause here where I am there's always sunshine
Walk down the street now, can't find my feet now
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Just been with my girl, she changed my whole world
When I was lonely she come to hold me
She squeeze me so tight I'm feeling alright
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Yeah, I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Somebody in love, somebody in love
Someone who just stares at the stars up above
Somebody in love, somebody in love
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
I lost my suitcase, can't tie my boot lace
Forgot my game plan, I don't know where I am
I lost my house key, I lost it at sea
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love, yeah
Somebody in love, somebody in love
Someone who just stares at the stars up above
Somebody in love, somebody in love
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
It's after midnight, don't need no street light
'Cause here where I am there's always sunshine
Walk down the street now, can't feel my feet now
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love, yeah
Somebody in love, somebody in love
Someone who just stares at the stars up above
Somebody in love, somebody in love
I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Yeah, somebody in love, somebody in love
Someone who just stares at the stars up above
Somebody in love, somebody in love
Well, I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Oh, I guess I'm acting like somebody in love
Oh, I guess I'm acting like somebody, somebody in love
Yeah, yeah, somebody, somebody in love
Yeah, I think I'm in love, somebody in love
Oh, yeah

When will we open our eyes
And finally discover
We are united by one blood?
When will we realize
We're sisters and brothers
And what the world
Needs now is love?
There's a dreamer inside
Each one of us
Who wants to believe
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
There is still a dream (oh)
(aah)
A brother down on his luck
Fallen to chances
We could pick the brother up
A sister down on her knees
Prayin' for answers
Why don't you show
The sister love?
All over the world
Life is unjust
But I do believe
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
There is still a dream
And everyone needs one
'cause no one is freed from
The worries of life
That drag us down
If you can't make it
My hands can take it
We'll stand
Together and pray
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
(to show the world)
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
(whoa-oh)
(to show the world)
There is still a dream
(there's still a dream)
There is still a dream (oh)

(Verse)
On a regular afternoon
Took off today and I'm coming home early
To be with you..
You get so red school
There's only one thing I wanna do
Is make love to you
Over and over again
Lost in your skin
And it's so amazing
I just can't hold it in
(Chorus)
When you make that ugly face
It's so good to me
When you make that ugly face
You look so sexy to me
(Verse)
Can't get no much better than this
If it did , it'd set the world on fire
Shower me with hersheys kisses
So glad to get what you been missing
Baby won't you take it like you want this last name
Oh you chocolate frame feels so good to me
And it's so amazing
I just can't hold it in
(Chorus)
When you make that ugly face
It's so good to me
When you make that ugly face
You look so sexy to me
(Bridge)
I love it when you bite down those lips
Eyes in the top of your eye lids
So good to me girl
Heaven when I'm digging in them hips
I'ma make you scream so much
'Cause you look so sexy
(Chorus)
When you make that ugly face
It's so good to me
When you make that ugly face
You look so sexy to me

Who's the girl inside of the blue screen light?
The sun is just pouring out, everything's out of site
Turn around, the room is just black and white
She's whispering nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And it's not true
And it's not fair
And it's not new
And it's not California here
Later on you're breaking the boxes down
There's nobody out tonight, nobody's hanging 'round
So you take the drive that used to be almost right
But now it's just empty lots around you
All these empty lots around you
And they don't know
What you hold dear
And they can't see
That it's not California here
Come a time when I may just walk away
The sun is just barely up, the sky is completely gray
And you're the one I wanna be with today
Let them say nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And I'm not strong
And you're not rich
And we're not lost
Where we don't live
And it's not true
And it's not fair
And they're not us
And it's not California here
I'm the one who wants to be with you tonight
And I'm the one who wants to be the one you're with tonight
And I'm the one who wants to be the one you're with tonight
And I'm the one who wants to be the one you're with tonight

When you speak, a symphony begins
Melodies of a thousand violins
When you touch me baby,
My horn starts to play
To the beat of a soulful serenade.
Ooh, maestro, my heart sings along
Keeping time with each stroke of your baton.
Perfect rhythm, sweet harmony
Makes me want to dance
Makes me want romance
Puts me in a trance.
Baby, I hear music
You, you and music!

He loves and she loves,
And they love
So why can`t you love
And I love like too?
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love,
And that`s what we both should do.
Oh I always knew someday you`d come along,
We`ll make a twosome that just can`t go wrong,
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won`t you
Love me as I love you?
Oh I always knew someday you`d come along,
We`ll make a twosome that just can`t go wrong,
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won`t you
Love me as I love you?
Won`t you love me, as I love you?
Original Version:
Peter:
Now that I have found you
I must hang around you.
Though you may refuse me,
You will never lose me.
If the human race is
Full of happy faces -
Frankie:
It`s because they all love
That wonderous thing they call love.
[Refrain]
Peter:
He loves and she loves,
And they love
So why can`t you love
And I love like too?
Frankie:
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love,
And that`s what we both should do.
Peter:
Oh I always knew someday you`d come along,
Frankie:
We`ll make a twosome that just can`t go wrong,
Hear me
Peter:
He loves and she loves
And they love so won`t you
Love me as I love you?
Frankie:
Feel a funny feeling
In my heart a-stealing;
If it`s love, I`m for it.
Gosh! How I adore it!
You`re the silver lining
For which I`ve been pining.
Peter:
Lonesome days are over;
From now on, we`re in clover.
[Refrain]

If you should leave me,
I know it would grieve me,
So honey please remember,
Absence makes the heart grow fonder...
For somebody else
I love you dearly,
I'm yours sincerely,
But honey please remember,
Absence makes the heart grow fonder...
For somebody else
When the cat's away the mice will play,
I don't say I will but still I may,
I may be blue away from you,
And then again I may be gay.
When I get fretful, I get forgetful,
So honey please remember,
Absence makes the heart grow fonder,
For somebody else.
When the cat's away the mice will play,
I don't say I will but still I may,
I may be blue away from you,
And then again I may be gay.
When I get fretful I get forgetful,
So honey please remember,
Absence makes the heart grow fonder,
For somebody else...
For somebody else...

It's the one and only Lennox Avenue,
That's the one and only place to travel to;
Music in the air,
Dancing everywhere,
That's Harlem hospitality!
When you hear a welcome to your song,
You'll keep shoutin' hallelujah all night long;
You never rest
When you get the best
Of Harlem hospitality!
It's a waste of life until you hear a song and love it,
You just, "Yeah, man!"
It's a taste of life to shim-sham-shimmy with the "Black and Tan."
You don't need to eat an apple every day,
Hi-de-ho will keep the doctor far away,
You can't get ill
When you get the thrill
Of Harlem hospitality!

I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
"I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride"
I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, "`till death do us part"
I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive
Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive
Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right
Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive
I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive
Sir Charles came from a sanitorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive
Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly
Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

My my my
Look at all the faces
There ain't nobody
feelin' outta place here
'Cause they're movin'
and they're groovin'
and it sure looks good to me
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me
Well everybody
havin' such a good time
Well my my baby
I just spent my last dime
Well that's okay
'cause I'm havin' fun
I'm gonna stay till the night is done
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me
Well don't you fight it just feel it
When your baby takes you out on the floor
Everybody is out a reelin'
Steamin' and out to roll
Well you don't have to worry
about the latest dance craze
Just get up on the floor
shake your hips and move your legs
'cause when the band starts with that groove
you know you just can't help but move
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me

I'll never fail you
Whatever may be
I'll never tail you
Depend upon me
I'll see them all through
The things you've planned.
But if they fall through
I'll understand,
And when shadows trail you
I'll bring you the sun
I'll never fail you
There's no other one
I'm yours forever
We never will part
I'll never never fail you sweetheart

Yesterday, when I was young,
The taste of life was sweet, as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life, as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned,
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand,
I lived by night, and shunned the naked light of day,
And only now, I see, how the years ran away
Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me,
And so much pain, my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time, and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think, what life, was all about,
And every conversation, I can now recall,
Concerned itself with me, and nothing else at all
Yesterday, the moon was blue,
And every crazy day, brought something new to do,
I used my magic age, as if it were a wand,
And never saw the worst, and the emptiness beyond
The game of love I played, with arrogance and pride,
And every flame I lit, too quickly, quickly died,
The friends I made, all seemed somehow to drift away,
And only I am left, on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me, that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste, of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay,
For yesterday, when I was young

Lonely grief is hounding me
Like the lonely shadow hounding me
It's always there just out of sight
Like a fragling dream on a lightening night
Lonely wind cries out my name
Sad as haunted music in the rain
It's born of grief and born of woe
But I hear it call and I've got to go
Where can I be headed for
The blues call in my north
To lick my heart once more
Love lives in a lonely land
Where there's no helping hand to understand
Why does it bring this hate to me
Why it don't matter why
I only know misery has to be part of me

Arriverderci, Roma
Goodbye, goodbye to Rome
City of a million moon lit faces
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home
Arriverderci, Roma
It's time for us to part
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning
In her heart
Arriverderci, Roma
It's time for us to part
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning
In her heart

Who do you think is comin' to town?
You'll never guess who
Lovable, hug able, Emily Brown
Miss Brown to you
What if the rain comes pattering down
My heaven is blue
Can it be sending me Emily Brown
Miss Brown to you
I know her eyes will thrill ya
But go slow, oh, oh
Don't you all get too familiar
Why do you think she's comin' to town
Just wait and you'll see
The lovable little Miss Brown to you
Is baby to me, yes, yes

Toyland, toy land
Li-ittle girl and boy land
While you dwell within it
You are ever happy there
Childhood's joy land
Mi-istic merry toy land
Once you pass its borders
You can ne'er return again
When you've grown up my dears
And are as old as I
You'll laugh and ponder on the years
That roll so swiftly by my dears
That roll so swi-iftly by-why
Childhood's joy land
Mi-istic merry toy land
Once you pass its borders
You can ne'er return again

When you feel your bones a shakin'
And your temperature is risin'
And the groove begins to move you
It's the King of Swing. . .
When you see those fires' burnin'
And your fever is a risin'
And the drums begin a poundin'
It's the King of Swing. . .

Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Don't know why
But I love, I do, yeah, yeah
'Cause I like the way you love me
Oh, girl, oh, oh
Every time you kiss me
Thrills me from my head to feet
And I tell myself that deep inside
There will be no one else for me
'Cause I like the way you love me
Love me, love me
Oh, girl, oh, oh
And I like the way you thrill me, oh, girl, mmm, hmm
Well, you thrill me to my soul
And I like, I like it all so
And I tell myself that deep inside
I could never let you go
'Cause I like the way you love me
Love me, thrill me, chill me, love me, oh, baby
Oh, girl, oh, oh
And I like the way you love me, oh, girl, oh, oh
I love, your my love
You are mine

I just don't know, what's this all about?
What is it all about, boys?
I just don't know, what's this all, all about?
The woman I love, is tryin' to put me out
She said she didn't want me
Why should I hang around?
Hey, why should I hang around?
And that if I hang around, I would be jail house bound
I love that woman, more than she will ever know
Yes, I love her
Hey baby, more than you will ever know
But if you drive me away, I won't be back no more
I stole that woman, stole her from my best friend
Yeah, hee, from my best friend
But that old fool's so darn lucky
He's 'bout to get her back again

This is what I have from the life record recorded during Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw (Poland) in 1974
"Corinne, Corinna why (where) you've been so long
Tell me Corinna why (where) you've been so long
I haven't had no lovin' since you've been gone
I love Corinna, I tell you where I do
Well, I love Corinna, I tell you where I do
Well, I hope some day ....... (?) Canda love me too
Corinne, Corinna where you'd stay late night
Tell me Corenna where you'd stay last night
You came home this morning the suny shinin' rise (?)
I met Corinna way across the sea
Yes I met Corinna way across the sea
She didn't write me no letter, she didn't care for me
Bye, bye Corinna I got to leave you now
Bye, bye Corinna I got to leave you now
Well I know you didn't mean it, no good, no harm"

I got a book
That tells my story
As I look
It's being
Written before me
Word by word
And page by page
Everything
I'll ever do
Is being displayed
Every word
Controls my feet
And even tells me
When I should speak
Who ever's writing
Is on a roll
But now my world
Is spinning right
Out of control
Oh, my life
Oh, my life
I look tomorrow
Is out of sight
Oh my life
Oh my life
Although
I'm trying
It's hard
To live right
[Repeat: x4]
Oh, my life
And my thoughts
Are there to see
Too late to change
Anything that's mean
If I'd a pen
I'd change some facts
But I'm scared
Of how my family
And friends will react
Oh, my life
Oh, my life
(Yeah)
And don't
I know it
It's hard
To live right
Oh my life
Oh my life
(Yeah)
I look tomorrow
Is out of sight
Oh, my life
Oh, my life
(Yeah)
And though
I know it
It's hard
To live right
Oh, my life
Oh, my life
(Yeah)
Although
I'm trying
It's hard
To live right
[Repeat: x8]
Oh, my life

I've been wishing that you'd prove me wrong,
That you'd come clean and rue the damage the done,
Restore my faith in you
But you've got no reason to
'Cause ain't it easier to just move on?
One door closing means another one
Opens unto
Some unsuspecting fool
Sure, you can forget about all the things you've done.
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
High-tail it when it gets to be too much
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
You can sell us down the river,
Sell us down the river
You were never the one
To suffer
I've been hearing that you're leaving town.
The dust never settles when you're around.
Too many people with
Your name on top of their lists
Now, tell me, when you start again,
Where will you house your skeletons?
Or will they stay behind,
Your settlement in kind?
Sure, you can forget about all the things you've done.
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
High-tail it when it gets to be too much
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
You can sell us down the river,
Sell us down the river
You were never the one
To suffer
Down the river
Down the river
Down the river
Down the river

(I love the way you say goodnight)
I kinda like the way you mumble while you fumble for the key
More time for kissing me
(I love the way you say goodnight)
I kinda like the way you linger with your finger on the bell
More kisses and they're swell
When you say gotta get home by twelve
I always say let's go
'cause you can take longer to say good night than any three others I know
(Both) I love the way you say goodnight
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb
Mmmmmm I'm never never never going home
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the way you always say) good night
(The way you always whisper honey nighty night)
The way you let our kisses mingle 'til I tingle to my toes
(giggle ... We're blushing like a rose)
I love the way (I kinda like the way the extraordinary way) you say good night (the way you always say don't go just hold me tight)
I kinda like the way you giggle while you jiggle with your bag
(sign ... our heart's are playing tag)
When you say (we just got to be home by twelve)
But don't I always say let's go 'cause you take longer to say good night than any three others I know
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the super duper special way) goodnight
(The way you have me flying higher than a kite)
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb
(It looks as though you're never going)
No I'm never never never never never never gonna go home

Every moment I'm near you
I try to understand
Every second I try to believe
In how I am
In the silence of moonlight
I find myself and you
Just as always I'm dreaming
I know you're dreaming too
And all the tears that I've cried
Are maybe drops of rain
After all
And every sunset sky
Is here with us forever now
Quando canto me lembro
De tudo o que é bom
Só passando por muito
Eu sei o que é dor
(When I sing I remember
Of everything that's good
Just being through a lot
I know what is pain)
Não quero nunca esconder
Talvez eu possa até me arrepender
Só porque então pensei
Que gente possa ser
Bem mais que um simplesmente ser
(I never want to hide
Maybe I can even regret
Just because then I thought
That people can be
Much more that a simple being)
Don't have to try too hard
It's not a secret held after all
'Cause every falling star
Is here with us (forever)
Não quero nunca perder
Talvez eu pense até em querer
Só porque então pensei
Que gente possa ser
Bem mais que um simplesmente
(I never want to hide
Maybe I can even regret
Just because then I thought
That people can be
Much more that a simple being)

The song that you sang so sweetly
You called it our love refrain
It's gone and I'm left completely
Out in the cold again
I dreamed that our love would linger
But just memories remain
As I gaze at that ring-less finger
Out in the cold again
True, it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new
But deep down inside my whole world depended on you
I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain
But now I'm back where you found me
Out in the cold again
(True, it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new)
(But deep down inside my whole world depended on you)
I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain
But now I'm back where you found me
Out in the cold again
Out in the cold

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

I have a feeling that beneath the little halo on your noble head
There lies a thought or two the devil might be interested to know
You're like the finish of a novel that I'll finally have to take to bed
You fascinate me so
I feel like Christopher Columbus when I'm near enough to contemplate
The sweet geography descending from your eyebrow to your toe
The possibilities are more than I can possibly enumerate
That's why you fascinate me so
So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me
But oh my darling you forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me, or will you annihilate me
You fascinate me so
So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me
But oh my darling you forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me, or will you annihilate me
You aggravate me
You irritate me
You fascinate me so

A rat done bit my sister Nell.
(with Whitey on the moon)
Her face and arms began to swell.
(and Whitey's on the moon)
I can't pay no doctor bill.
(but Whitey's on the moon)
Ten years from now I'll be payin' still.
(while Whitey's on the moon)
The man jus' upped my rent las' night.
('cause Whitey's on the moon)
No hot water, no toilets, no lights.
(but Whitey's on the moon)
I wonder why he's uppi' me?
('cause Whitey's on the moon?)
I was already payin' 'im fifty a week.
(with Whitey on the moon)
Taxes takin' my whole damn check,
Junkies makin' me a nervous wreck,
The price of food is goin' up,
An' as if all that shit wasn't enough
A rat done bit my sister Nell.
(with Whitey on the moon)
Her face an' arm began to swell.
(but Whitey's on the moon)
Was all that money I made las' year
(for Whitey on the moon?)
How come there ain't no money here?
(Hm! Whitey's on the moon)
Y'know I jus' 'bout had my fill
(of Whitey on the moon)
I think I'll sen' these doctor bills,
Airmail special
(to Whitey on the moon)

I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
I love my man
I'm a liar if I say I don't
But I'll quit my man
I'm a liar if I say I won't
I've been your slave, baby
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
But before I'll be your dog
I'll see you in your grave
My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long ways to go
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curled
But my mother, she gave me something
It's going to carry me through this world
Some men like me 'cause I'm happy
Some 'cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money
Some say me Billie
Baby, you're built for speed
Now, if you put that all together
Makes me everything a good man needs

Catana, what goddess gave you the name
That has this heart of mine so a flame?
Tell me, Catana, what heaven gave you your eyes?
What elfin fiddler plays for your sighs?
Fashioned of Venus, that is your form and your face
Two clinging vines for arms, hold me in tender embrace
While the mood poses from lips made of roses
Each word opposes all else but love
Catana, like a Madonna, you I'll adore forevermore
While the mood poses from lips made of roses
Each word opposes all else but love
Catana, like a Madonna, you I'll adore forevermore

The maddest kind of love
Is a love you know is wrong
It burns a hole right through your soul
And cuts you like a knife
The maddest kind of love
Is a love you know won't last
It fills your heart with passion
Makes you lie about your past
You know I speak from experience
I live it each day
It's something she does, it's something she'll say
It's the maddest kind of love
The maddest kind of love
Is a love just for the thrill
It doesn't have a conscience
Only lives for the kill
The maddest kind of love
Is a love you know's a lie
It leaves you feeling empty
To weak too cold to cry
You know I speak from experience
I live it each day
It's something she does, it's something she'll say
It's the maddest kind of love

Just a little bit south of North Carolina
That's where I long to be
In a little brown shack in South Carolina
Someone waits for me
In each letter she says that the weather is fine and the folks are feeling great
That the garden looks grand and the red rose vine is clinging to the gate
Just a little bit south of North Carolina
That's where my thoughts all stray
To the one I love best in South Carolina
I'm going back some day
I can hardly wait to see the face of the one I like
Just a little bit south of North Carolina
I'll find paradise
Just a little bit south of North Carolina
That's where my thoughts all stray
To the one I love best in South Carolina
I'm going back some day
I can hardly wait to see the face of the one I like
Just a little bit south of North Carolina
I'll find paradise

The Soul Cadillac is drivin' up
The Soul Cadillac is in me
Well a soul transformed from a dirty truck
By a girl who loves me
I was alone
I wore the fragrance of men who worked in the heat
I work all day
Pouring the asphalt and shaping the concrete
And I sing now
The Soul Cadillac is drivin' up
The Soul Cadillac is in me
Well a soul transformed from a dirty truck
By a girl who loves me
She's a warm-hearted girl
And such a treasure to hold
To a working man's body
She's like music with plenty of soul
She's my Soul Cadillac
I met her down at the East Town Pub
In a slow dance we embraced
She fixed up my home down by the water
And made it a comfortable place
Oh I tell ya
She's a warm-hearted girl
And such a treasure to hold
To a working man's body
She's like music
She's my soul
The Soul Cadillac is drivin' up
The Soul Cadillac is in me
Well a soul transformed from a dirty truck
By a girl who loves me
She's the girl who loves me

Certain bad things did happen
Make you realize that you been here
A lot longer than a whole bunch of people thought you would

Love me, love me
Love me with all your heart
Kiss me dear while I hold you tight
Make this evening a magic night
Love me, love me
Promise me we'll never part
You can make all my dreams come true
If you'll love me as I love you
Darling I love you, I love you
More than you ever could know
Daytimes I spent dreaming of you
Nightimes telling you so
Yours is the softness of spring to me
Your is the beauty of fall
Heaven is mine when you cling to me
You I adore overall
(Love me. love me)
( Love me with all your heart) Kiss me dear while I hold you tight
I'll make this evening a magic night
(Love me, love me)
(Promise we'll never part)
You can make all my dreams come true
If you'll love me as I love you
If you'll love me as I love you
If you'll love me as I love you

They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When there was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always there right on the job
They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?
Once I built a railroad, I made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a railroad, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell
Full of that yankee doodly dum
Half a million boots went sloggin' through hell
And I was the kid with the drum
Say, don't you remember, they called me Al
It was Al all the time
Why don't you remember, I'm your pal
Say buddy, can you spare a dime?
Once in khaki suits, ah gee we looked swell
Full of that yankee doodly dum
Half a million boots went sloggin' through hell
And I was the kid with the drum
Oh, say, don't you remember, they called me Al
It was Al all the time
Say, don't you remember, I'm your pal
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

Judge you want to hear my plea
Before you open up your court
But I don't want no sympathy
'Cause I done cut my good man's throat
I caught him with a trifling Jane
I warned him 'bout before
I had my knife and went insane
And the rest you ought to know
Judge, judge, please mister judge,
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, good mister judge,
Let me go away from here
I want to take a journey
To the devil down below
I done killed my man
I want to reap just what I sow
Oh judge, judge, lordy lordy judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, hear me judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
I love him so dear
I cut him with my barlow (?)
I kicked him in the side
I stood here laughing o'er him
While he wallowed around and died
Oh judge, judge, lordy judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, sweet mister judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, good kind judge
Burn me 'cause I don't care
I don't want no one good mayor
To go my bail
I don't want to spend no
Ninety-nine years in jail
So judge, judge, good kind judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair

I live in a jingle jangle jungle
If you ain't got it you can't be
Fightin' over crumbs
Wait till payday comes
Gettin' green ink thumbs
From countin'
While it's mountin'
In this jingle jangle jungle I call home.
You live in a jingle jangle jungle
If you can't earn it you ain't free
Where a life is spent
Tryin' to meet the rent
Payin' back the cent
You borrow
Some tomorrow
In this jingle jangle jungle you call home.
We live in a jingle jangle jungle
You're only worth what you can buy
So keep on workin' hard
To keep your own back yard
Teach your kids that God
Ain't fiction
Contradiction
In this jingle jangle jungle you call home.
I live in a jingle jangle jungle
If it don't jingle it's gonna fold
All the things you own
Are only here on loan
It's by bread alone
You're livin'
Call this livin'
In this jingle jangle jungle we call home.

Without my walking stick, I'd go insane
I can't look my best I feel undressed without my cane.
Must have my walking stick 'cause it may rain
When it pours can't be outdoors without my cane.
If I ever left my house without my walking stick
Well it would be something I could never explain
Oh the thing that makes me click, on lovers lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane.

Oh give me some hominy grits
And some red sugar-cured ham
Give me a great big bowl of gravy
I'd be such a happy man
If I could see the magnolias and azaleas in bloom
Let me up to the table and give me lots of elbow room
Then pass me that mammy fried okie
And some good old black eyed peas
Give me a hay rack full of biscuits
Make my coffee black if you please
If you feed me out of Dixie in a style so grand
You'll have yourself a happy man
Sorghum molasses
You'll have yourself a happy man
Now give me some of the hominy grits boy
Or shut my mouth with a great big slab of that sugar-cured ham
And about a half a gallon of this old thickened gravy
And brother you're gonna have yourself a mighty happy man
Well it seems like when you eat stuff like that
You can see the magnolias on them honeysuckles
Well you knows that they're in bloom
Oh set me down to that table, boy, scoot over
And give me lots of elbow room
Then pass me that mammy-fried okie
And some good old black eyed peas
Give me a hayrack full of hot biscuits
And make my coffee black if you please
If you feed me out of Dixie in a style oh so grand
You'll have yourself a happy man

Swingin' through the jungle, I have sailed the 7 sea's
King of the monkeys and nothing bothers me
I wanna fly right through the sky, I wanna touch the moon
But I hear it call me and I have to go back soon
Fires in the city, there was dancin' in the streets
More than a scene and mambo was the king
I wanna fly right back through time, like a fever without care
And I hear it calling me and I wanna take you there
So please baby, show me that you are mine

You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame,
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame,
You've got the banjoes strummin' and plunkin' out a tune to beat the band,
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought Dixie back to Dixieland.
You make the cotton easy to pick, Mame.
You give my old mint julep a kick, Mame.
You make the old magnolia tree, blossom at the mention of your name.
You've made us feel alive again, you've given us the drive again.
You make the south revive again, Mame.
You've brought the cake-walk back into style, Mame.
You make the weepin' willow tree smile, Mame.
Your skin is Dixie satin, there's rebel in your manner and your speech.
You may be from Manhattan but Georgia never had a sweeter peach.
You make our black-eyed peas and our grits Mame
Seem like the Sill of Fare at the Ritz, Mame.
You came, you saw, you conquered and absolutely nothing is the same.
Your special fascination'll, prove to be inspirational,
We think you're just sensational Mame.

Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
Taught me to sparkle anew
Brought me dream-of-able you
Sweetheart
Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
An inconceivable pair
That gave our budding affair
Its start
The stars gleam
The moon beams
The skies seem to smile
The breeze flies
A tree sighs
Please stay around a while
Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
A combination so real
An invitation to steal
Your heart
Now the stars gleam
The moon beams
The skies seem to smile
Oh, the breeze flies
A tree sighs
Please, stay around a while
Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
A combination so real
Oh, oh, an invitation to steal
Your heart

I've got this beautiful lover who's got a special friend
that I can only talk to when we're alone in bed
This friend gets so excited when deliclitly (sic) rubbed
and fills my precious baby with the feelings that she's loved
I really do adore this friend who's always on my mind
My lover says I'm obsessed but that she doesn't mind
I sensuously caress my lover's tender skin
I press my mouth against her warmth and eagerly begin
I apply direct pressure to her secret spot
and plunge my tongue into her love so fragrant, wet and hot
My baby's feeling energized, emotionally high
Sometimes it's better to give than receive, I willingly oblige
My hair becomes dishevelled as I make love orally
What a rush of satisfaction to administer ecstacy
Unsuppressible mewing gasps escape from her lips
as tingling torrents of pleasure race through her undulating hips

[Music: O'Donnell, Lyrics: Yurkiewicz]
There is a fantastic book which I adamantly recommend
and after reading it you'll never be able to eat the same way again!
This book details the horrors of meat production at its "best"
and casts a glaring light on many problems interconnectedness
The flesh production industries
all operate insidiously
Chemically ridden fat is glamorized
while torture and slaughter are disguised
Epidemics of heart disease, cancer and obesity
Storing up unwittingly dioxin and DDT...
YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT!
You'll be profoundly horrified as you realize the indoctrination
implemented by industry upon the people of this nation
irreversible chemical pollution and excesive resource waste
have given animal based products a positivly unpalable taste!
I'd like to thank John Robbins for composing such an important tome
This environmental dietary bible should be the keystone of every home
The information contained in these pages will certainly make you realize
That for the preservation of life on earth everyone must change their lives!

By a lonely prison wall,
I heard a young girl calling:
"Michael, they have taken you away,
For you stole Trevelyn's corn,
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."
Low lie the fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry.
By a lonely prison wall,
I heard a young man calling
"Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
Against the famine and the crown,
I rebelled, they cut me down.
Now you must raise our child with dignity."
Low lie the fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry.
By a lonely harbor wall,
She watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
For she lived to hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry.
Low lie the fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry.

Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)
People hint and wonder and they want to know how and why
but let me first introduce myself I'm tagging name Romye
I'm 20 years of age I ran across some bullshit
People promise you bowl of cherries but don't forget there are pits
No hints, it's quicks, it's like the water and grits
They got another boy who can rhyme and do the fly flips
And that's I high I better get by because my ally
about to flip that crazy shit while I go look for some thai
I need some zig-zag, zig-zag (3x)
I need some zig-zag, zig-zag
how I need those zig-zag
[I need some] zig-zag, zig-zag
how I love to get high
Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)
What the?
Oh what the heck
Niggas just want to get wrecked to the track
It's brand new and heavy as a Chevy and in fact
The Pharcyde is coming and I hope we're not wack
But at this point there's no turning back
But to be exact, I've got more flavors than a bucket full of fruit
In 92 we take cash 93 we take loot
Because the vinyl is delicious=20
I'm the nigga who's got bitches
Michael Ross is the genie he's giving our wishes
One I want to just jam with your band
Two two two...=20
You gotta play it all across the land
Three three three...
The plan is grab the ducats and say fuck it to the critics hey now
I was walkin' down the street balin'(?) to the beat
Phat beats in my head tennis shoes on my feet
Nigga tried to flex but he had to be smoked
So I shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
What?
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Yep
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke (5x)
Shot-him-in-the-ass-on-the-downstroke
Souped on the beat like a bowl of chicken noodles
I love Spanish dishes but no I'm not Menudo
I can dig Kung-Fu I flip hoes like Judo
Never date a chick who has a mom named Bruno
A anna bonanna(?) bananafanafuno
Yet you know Shafino=20
Met her in a trio
Souped up my (glass) jet flew her at the wheel
I'm somewhat Creole=20
Don't like the man of steel
I'm not your carbon copy but your first rap (jalopy) for real
I used to deal but the fuzz popped me
I had the hydros but they repo'd my crops and steel
I chills like scotch on the rocks=20
'Cause I just gets paid for them hard-core props
You know?
How long can you freak the funk? (2x)
I separate the good stuff from the junk
How long can you freak the funk
Yeah, freak the funk
All right, freak the funk
Freak the funk (4x)
I want the farmer man. Farmer man.
I want the farmer man. You want the farmer man?
Yeah, I want the farmer man. You don't want no farmer man.
Give me the farmer man. Once again it's the farmer man.
I go from skip-skop(?) to hip-hop to be-bop to P-funk
Cutting enough bullshit to turn a tree into a tree trunk
'Cause we've sunk ships from the Pacific to the Atlantic
I dig dips who've got the hips that are gigantic 'cause I'm frantic
Take you in a frenzy=20
Takin' you out is easier than pullin' a pull-out out of a Benzie
Box well I rocks the orthodox styles to make you squirm
Yes I come from Callie no I do not have a perm
I stand firm on the mic device when I gets nice
Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
I got more flavor than 7-11 Slurpees
If Magic can admit he got AIDS, fuck it--I got herpes
Ah shit.
NS, NS
Sounds like NS to me!
Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)

You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!
Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!
Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map
You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map
And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap

While angels are shining the sky, it's Christmas eve
A sweet little angel takes heavenly leave
She likes to help Santa Claus dress up the tree
So next Christmas morning, look up and you'll see
Sweet Angie, the Christmas tree angel
On the top of the tippy, tippy top of the tree
All dressed up in stardust and tinsel
Have a very, very, merry, merry Christmas, says she
She colors the lights and she sprinkles the snow
She hangs up the holly and bright mistletoe
The loveliest angel you ever have met
She makes Christmas one day we never forget
Sweet Angie, the Christmas tree angel
On the top of the tippy, tippy top of the tree
All dressed up in stardust and tinsel
Have a very, very, merry, merry Christmas, says she
When Santa has filled all the stockings with toys
And left all his gifts for the good girls and boys
Sweet Angie is busy till dawn starts to break
Arranging the toys till the children awake
Then with the morning, a smile on her face
When Angie has put all the toys in their place
The next thing you know, softly laughing with glee
Sweet Angie returns to the top of the tree
Sweet Angie, the Christmas tree angel
On the top of the tippy, tippy top of the tree
All dressed up in stardust and tinsel
Have a very, very, merry, merry Christmas, says she
On the top of the tippy, tippy top of the tree
Have a very, very, merry, merry Christmas, says she
Merry Christmas

No time for tears
But the sky full of clouds remains
All of the sudden love and care
And my lonelyness
Somewhere in mountains
Near the stars
Far from the sea
But the sea that I saw
Has made me come back
Somewhere in mountains
Near the stars
Far from the sea
But the sea that I saw
Has made me come back

You ain't been blue no, no, no.
You ain't been blue,
Till you've had that mood indigo.
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues".
Always get that mood indigo,
Since my baby said goodbye.
In the evenin' when lights are low,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me,
I'm just a soul who's
Bluer than blue can be.
When I get that mood indigo,
I could lay me down and die.

Time alone will tell
If our romance is real
Or just a springtime spell
For heaven knows and time will tell
Though I know so well
What we believe is love
May just turn out to be
A memory, but time will tell
Do we really care
Or do we share a fool's imagination?
Nights will hurry by
Then you will know, and so will I
When Spring has had its fling
If you are in my arms
We'll know it's not a spell
We'll know it's real, but time will tell

It's morning time
I can't wait until we are away
'Cause last night
Is just a preview to the love we'll make
It's morning time
To see the sun shining off your face
Really just reminds
Of how more beautiful you are each day
Faithfully how we still love so deep
Much better than a fantasy
You and I became we
I believe more than what I can see
Keep on believing mind could conceive
God must really love me
[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
And it's getting better with time
Lately I find
You keep getting better with time
You're mine
And it's getting better with time
Lately I find
You keep getting better with time
I know we love
Don't know what's betting your smiles or your cares
I know my love
The way we are is no coincidence
'Cause both of us
We know that love is more than just a gift
It's more than trust
It's how we know that destiny exists
Faithfully how we still love so deep
Much better than a fantasy
How you and I became we
I believe more than what I can see
Keep on mind could conceive
God must really love me
After coming so far
And to receive a love like ours
Everything we've been through
Love I'd do it all again with you
Many love's has gone wrong
Until you came around
Wasn't always sure of faith
Girl you make love worth the wait
'Cause you're mine
[Chorus]
Better with time
Lately I find
You keep getting better with time
You're mine
And it's getting better with time
Lately I find
You keep getting better with time

(Angel baby you're mine forever)
(Angel baby, you angel baby you)
Who is the dream who starts me dreaming
Angel baby
Then keeps me worrying and schemeing
You, angel baby, you
Who starts me walking 'round in clover
Angel baby
Then flips my crazy heart right over
You, angel baby, you
Who is the chick I would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for me to kiss
Who is the girl who can curl me around her finger when we kiss again
Who can imagine what I'd give for Angel baby
Just for the chance to love and live for
You, angel baby, you
(Angel baby) you're mine forever
(Angel baby) you, angel baby, you
(Who is the chick he would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for him to kiss)
(Who is the girl who can twirl him around her little finger when they kiss again)

I held my baby last, until everything was alright
I held my baby last, until everything was alright
She woke up early in the morning, baby
All she gonna do was fuss and fight
She said baby, baby, baby, baby please come back to me
Yes, now baby please come back to me
You know I love you baby
And you know all your love is free
Now it's past ten in the morning, babe
And everyting is goin' on wrong
Yes, you know everything is goin' on wrong
You know I been with you so long baby, ah,
But now you
Thinkin' to
Drive me away from home

You can do most anything, but whatever you do,
There's only one thing, you gotta have Chinese rhythm!
You can see sing and dance and play 'most anything you choose,
There's only one thing, you gotta have Chinese rhythm!
There's rhythm in love songs, rhythm in blues,
There's rhythm in almost anything you do.
When the moon is bright and you're making love,
There's only one thing, you gotta have Chinese rhythm!

I wants to stay here,
But I ain`t worthy.
You is too decent to understan`.
For when I see him he hypnotize me.
When he take hold of me with his hot hand.
Someday I know he`s coming back to call me.
He`s goin` to handle me an` hold me so.
It`s goin` to be like dyin`, Porgy, deep inside me -
But when he calls, I know I have to go.
If dere warn`t no Crown, Bess, if dere was only jus` you an`
Porgy, what den?

Don` let him take me,
Don` let him handle me an` drive me mad.
If you kin keep me,

An` I`d be glad.
There, there, Bess, you don` need to be afraid no mo`,
You`s picked up happiness and laid yo` worries down.
You goin` to live easy, you goin` to live high.
You goin` to outshine every woman in dis town.
An` remember, when Crown come that`s my business, Bess!
I loves you, Porgy,
Don` let him take me
Don` let him handle me
With his hot han`
If you kin keep me
I wants to stay here wid you forever.

What you think I is, anyway,
To let dat dirty houn` dog steal my woman?
If you wants to stay wid Porgy, you goin` stay.
You got a home now, Honey, an` you got love.
So no mo` cryin`, can`t you understan`?
You goin` to go about yo` business, singin` `cause
You got Porgy, you got a man.

Hello cat I just got back
I'm looking for that place they call the Chicken Shack
They say it's fine as wine
And it's really all a ball
No windows no doors
It's just a hole in the wall
Did you say it was located down by the creek
Where you can get a whole gob of good things to eat
All good portions of chicken once more is a cinch
You can even get the last part that went over the fence
There's a place where the lights coming through the wall
You'd better be mighty careful, let's have a ball
Come on all you cats and take a drink from my pack
'Cause the party's ready to start down at the chicken shack

We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight, and we
Would especially like to welcome all the representatives of Illinois'
Law enforcement community that have chosen to join us here in the
Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time. We sincerely hope that you all enjoy
The show and please remember people, that no matter who you are, and
Whatever you do to live, thrive and survive, there are still some
Things that make us all the same:
You, me, him, them -- everybody, people, everybody!
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (Someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you in the morning
I need you, (you) you, you when my soul's on fire
#change: C#m, A, C#m, be
Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide, I need you!
Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide,
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
You know people when you do find somebody, hold that woman, hold that
Man, love him, hold him, squeeze her, please her, hold, squeeze and
Please that person, give 'em all your love, signify your feelings with
Every gentle caress, because it's so important to have that special
Somebody to hold, kiss, miss, squeeze, and please.
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (Someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you in the morning
I need you, (you) you, you when my soul's on fire

Well, I was a fool, believe what ya said
Yes, I was a fool, believe what ya said
Yes, I'm goin' back home, I wish that I was dead
I'm goin' back home, gonna leave you alone
I'm goin' back home, gonna leave you all alone
I gotta find my babe, yes, you know I done her wrong
Oh, I was a fool, to leave you yesterday
Yes, I was a fool, to leave you yesterday
I gotta find me a woman, yes, I'll change my ways
Oh, goodbye baby, I may never see you any more
Yeah, goodbye baby, may never see you any more
Well, always love you darlin', hound you everywhere you go

I search each face in a crowd looking for you
Just a hoping to see you again
Those laughing eyes and tender lips that used to thrill me
So I search every face in a crowd
No matter where that I go I keep on staring
For the face that belongs to you
Just looking for the favorite color you're always wearing
So I search every face in a crowd
I know I've said that I didn't need you
Every day every night oh how I failed
But I'll keep hoping someday I'm gonna find you
Some lucky minute some happy hour some lucky day
So I'll search every face until I'll find you
I didn't know that I'd miss you this way
I hope I'm not too late because I love you
So I search every face in a crowd
So I search every face in a crowd

I was taught to always be nice so I open doors on impulse
Always make room on the sidewalk though I notice no one else does
They just plow through knocking you down
With a smug look on their faces
So I stay home writing my songs in my fantasy oasis
Would it be out of line
To spend the rest of my life in my head?
While I'm running my thumb along on the razor's edge?
Getting warm in the tub while I'm watching the clouds
Of the blood I spread
But I never said
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
Was drop dead
I'm a loner, like or not; a Marat; Inside I'm lonely
Purified by masochism in a bleeding ceremony
Light a candle, open my hand, and I'll end retaliations
From the dog pack cowardice here in the gauchest of the nations
Would it be too benign
To spend the rest of my time in my head?
Am I hurting myself to remember?- Like Orson's sled?
I've been waiting so long for the words to this song,
I bet I bleed to death
But I never said
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
Was drop dead
Now I hope that magically I will emerge back into life
Even though I'm vanishing now in a hemlock bath of wine
Become a hero swinging my sword in a bloody ancient world
And leave the life here ruined by guilt,
Where they need to thin the herd
Drop dead
Was what I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
Was drop dead
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
Was drop dead
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say
What I wanted to say

I've gotten good at leaning on metaphor.
I've gotten good at living on someone else's page.
I've cut my teeth on secondhand sentiment--
You can't trust a single thing I say.
I keep my closet free of skeletons
'Cause I'm much better at digging graves
But I always dig up bones in your sympathy--
I can't trust a single thing you say.
Don't look too hard
'Cause you won't like the scars
He left in me.
I've gotten good at making up metaphors.
I've gotten good at stretching the truth out of shape
And all these words are sweet and meaningless--
You can't trust a single thing I say
You can't trust a single thing I say
You can't trust a single thing I say
You can't trust a single thing I say

He was drunk as Cooter Brown
Words fell from his tongue
With a slurring silver sound
He come this way from the other side of town
He was drunk as Cooter Brown
And his coat hung 'round his shoulders
With a gangster's tone
A stylish man no woman leaves alone
He blamed the warmth of the evening
I blamed the circle 'round the moon
We spoke as if in solitude
While the world was spinning around us
And people started to stare
But I just didn't care
I just couldn't move
I was was floating on air
I knew
We two
Were drunk as Cooter Brown
Sooo...
He blamed the warmth of the evening
I blamed the circle 'round the moon
We spoke as if in solitude
While the world was spreading around us
And people started to sing
I just didn't care
I couldn't move
We were floating on air
Yes...
I knew
I too
Was drunk as Cooter Brown
I was just one step away
From that drunk to the floor sound
A lady's grace
I claimed to hold my ground
But I was drunk as Cooter Brown
While he poured the cup of his hand
Fell my old beau just to be sure
I wouldn't fall for a man like him in June
I blamed the warmth of the evening
And he blamed the circle 'round the moon
We spoke as if in solitude
While the world was spinning around us
And people started to sing
But i just didn't care
I just couldn't move
I was floating on air
I knew
We two
Were drunk as Cooter Brown
Yes, we were drunk as Cooter Brown
Crazy!
'Cause...so warm...so warm tonight...
Drunk as cooter brown...I'm high on life...
Excuse me sir...
Humming...
Hey!

Talk to me baby
Tell me what's the matter now
Tell me, baby what's the matter now?
Are you tryin' to quit me, baby
But you don't know how
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
But before I see you go
I see you in your grave
I'm a good gal
But my love is all wrong
I'm a good gal
But my love is all wrong
I'm a real good gal
But my love is gone

He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now, a-blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
A-toot, a-toot, a-toot-diddelyada-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with 'I'm
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He was our boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was buzy as a "bzzz" bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
Toot-toot-toot, toot-diddelyada, toot-diddelyada
Toot, toot, he blows it eight-to-the-bar
He can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with 'I'm
A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
Da-doo-da da-doo-da-da da
Da-doo-da da-doo-da-da da
Da-doo-da da-doo-da-da da
Da-doo-da da-doo-da-da
A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B!

Mandy is two
You ought to see her eyes of cornflower blue
They really look as it they actually knew
That she's a big girl now
Mandy is two
You ought to see how many things she can do
She knows her alphabet
And ties her own shoes
And no one showed her how
If you could see her majesty
With braids in her hair
Almost as though her Sunday beau
Came around and brought her an orchid to wear
Mummy is blue
Because her little girl is going on three
But Miss Amanda she's as proud as can be
Cause she's a big girl now

Now what we have is so beautiful ohh
We were keeping it on the low
And now I don't care if anybody knows
That I love you so deeply, completely

When you're feeling lonely

It's such a heavenly sight
Stars are shining just right
And if your heart is thumping just like mine
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign
I yearn for one little kiss
Can't continue like this
I get a crazy feeling down my spine
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign
What can I say what can I do
I love to go around with you
But dear it's much too much
When romancing I find that we're going Dutch
I feel suspended in air
You suspended me there
So darling please have pity say you're mine
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign
(Such a heavenly sight)
(Stars are shining just right)
(And if your heart is thumping just like mine)
(Give me a look give me a word give me a sign)

I love to go around with you
But dear it's much too much
When romancing I find that we're going Dutch
I feel suspended in air
You suspended me there
So darling please have pity say you're mine
Give me a look give me a word give me a sign
(Both) Give me a kiss give me a cue give me a hug
(Both) Give me a clue give me a look give me a word give me a sign

Remember the night
The night you said
I love you
Remember you vowed
By the stars above you

I got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got no car,
Got no mule,
Got no misery
Folks with plenty of plenty
They got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody?s gonna rob them while
they're out making more
What for?
I got no lock on the door
that's no way to be
They can steal the rug
From the floor
that's OK with me
Cause the things that I prize
Like the stars in the sky
Are all free
Say I've got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got my girl
Got my song,
Got heaven the whole daylong.
Got my girl
Got my lawn
Got my song
I've got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got my girl
Got my song,
Got heaven the whole daylong.
Got my girl
Got my lawn
Got my song

Manhattan-I'm up a tree
The one I've most adored
Is bored
With me.
Manhattan, I'm awf'lly nice,
Nice people dine with me,
And even twice.
Yet the only one in the world I'm mad about
Talks of somebody else
And walks out.
With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet pailletted gown
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here am I
Facing tomorrow
Alone with my sorrow
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.

I begged her, I pleaded, I told her
Baby, come out of your shell,
I told her
Maybe, you'll find that it's swell,
I argued, I threatened, I said
You can't send me home,
Not like this, then I finally got my kiss.
I begged her, I pleaded, I told her
Baby, come out of your shell,
And I told her
Maybe, you'll find that it's swell,
She argued, then I threatened
You can't send me home,
Not like this, then I finally got my kiss.

She rocked me back and forth 'til I quit crying.
she looked into that baby face of mine
and in an angels voice, she sang this lullaby
until my slumber carried me into the night.
"I'm grateful for these moments with you child.
I know you're only mine to borrow for a while.
soon youre gonna want to crawl away.
it's in your nature. Its just how we were made.
but I will still be loving you"
She had wished for us a normal family life
but 4 became my brother, she and I.
Times were hard for us but somehow we got by.
She was fearless through her tears and sacrifice
I had to grow up much faster than she would have liked
but when she knew that she had taught me wrong from right
she said "go on, I know you need to move away.
childhood is manhood slightly delayed,
but I will still be loving you"
I left home to try and find my way
Like a blind man feeling his way through a maze.
I love and lose befriend but not betray
because the things you taught inform how I behave.
In my darkest hours when I am afraid
or I'm not sure that I can take another day
I remember the one promise that you made,
"If the whole world shuts you down it'll be okay.
cause I will still be loving you"
Now that I'm a man I realize
what a gift it has been to have you in my life.
Your spirit is young although your body is tired
and soon for good you'll have to close your eyes
the years around your body like a weight.
I guess that too is just how we are made,
so when the angels come and carry you away
may they whisper in your ears, my serenade.
I will still be loving you.

While other lovers sing your praisesin phases deftly lyrical.
I'm a cat who's better at a scat songthat's satirical
In begging for your hand, sweet chick I hope you'll understand this lick.
My love to you I bring on account a you can sing
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
My love for you in true on account a you can do
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
My poor heart gives a start like a Jitter Bug just won't stop
Mix your crooning with my spooning and let me blow my top.
Your love to me I've sworn on account a mine is your'n
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp.
My love to you I bring on account a you can sing
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
My love for you in true on account a you can do
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
My poor heart gives a start like a Jitter Bug just won't stop
Mix your crooning with my spooning and let me blow my top.
Your love to me I've sworn on account a mine is your'n
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp.

Through a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame
Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So alone, so without you
How I wish, my heart with me
My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known
I pray that someday
Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence I beg my heart to replace
All through and oh so long and sleepless night

So you cry
What's it about, baby?
You ask why
Blues had to go and pick you
So you go
Down to the shore, kid's stuff
Don't you know
There's honey in the store for you, big stuff
Let's take a ride in my gravy train
The door's open wide
Come in from out of the rain
So you stare
Call it despair, big stuff
Don't you dare
I'm on the square about you
Let's have a try
It maybe that you're my guy
Let's take a ride on my gravy train
The door's open wide
Come in from out of the rain

dollar got the blues
gettin lower every day
dollar got the blues
gettin lower every day
i wanna do something about it
folks if i only had my way
used to be 2 for 1
now it's 1 for 2
used to be 2 for 1
now it's 1 for 2
what in the world are we poor people gonna do?

My love and devotion
Will always be true
Now and forever
I live for you
My love and devotion
Are yours, yours alone
Kiss me beloved
Say you're my own
I kiss your lips
Sweet and tender
They open Heaven's door
Won't you surrender
Forevermore
My love will grow deeper
As time passes by
Deep as the ocean
And as high as the sky
My love, my devotion
Are yours till I die

Hours, please be kind to be today
As I quickly look but mind drift away
But when in my lovers arms I fall
I ask that you will take no more
For these are the hours I've been waiting for so please,
My sweet hours be kind
Hours, won't you smile on me today
(early on my beauty hold my gaze) (

Well it's three o'clock in the morning' y'all
Oh, and I'm biding my time
I want you to give me two more Mr. Waiter
'Cause you know I got, I got a whole lot on my mind
I'm going back to Louisiana to that girl left behind
You know I been to Memphis baby, I been to Kansas City too
Never met a woman who could love me like you do
Back to Louisiana, to that girl I left behind
You know she's my kind of woman yeah she's just my size
She knocks me out the way she looks me in the eyes
I'm going back to Louisiana, to that girl I left behind, alright
She used to live in Shreveport but then she moved
Bet you ten to one she's going to Baton Rouge
I'm gonna look her up, if you know what I mean
If I have to go as far as New Orleans
Been fine talking to you but, you know that I
I got to find my baby, got to move on down the line
Back to Louisiana, to that girl I left behind, alright
She used to live in Shreveport but, but then she moved
Bet you ten to one she's going to Baton Rouge
I'm gonna look her up, if you know what I mean
If I have to go as far as New Orleans
It's been fine talking to you but, you know that I
I got to find my baby, I want to move on down the line
Going back to Louisiana, to that girl I left behind
Oh, I'm going back to Louisiana to that girl I left behind

Down here below
The winds of change are blowing
Through the weary night.
I prayed my soul will find me
Shining in the morning light,
Down here below.
Down here below,
It's not so easy
Just to be.
Sometimes I'm really all at sea.
You made me when the world was new
And skies were blue
And I'm here because there's you.
They say I'll never see your face
And we're out there from your grace,
The one you fashioned with your hand,
And scattered all across the land,
But I am happy just to know
That you must go
Where I must go
For there are winds and scars to show
Livin' here down here below
Down here below,
The setting sun is shining
On the melancholy mood.
I hear the distant thunder
And the crying of the blue
Down where below
I'm yours alone
The only one to call my own
The only one I've ever known
Sometimes I see you
Standing there
Sometimes I'm freer.
And you are here,
Down here with me,
You made me just the way a hear,
Or less feeling, eyes to see
A strange embrace, a simple hand,
A spirit free that says: "I can",
And I'm happy just to know
That you will go
Where I must go,
For you send me this I know
Living here, down here below,
Living here, down here below,
Living here, down here below.

FROM LOVER TO LOSER
(Arthur Kent - Ed Warren)
'63 Summit Music
(From lovers to losers from lovers to losers)
From lovers to losers that's me that's me
For your lips aren't willing like they used to be
You once were so hungry for my embrace
Now goodbye is written all over your face
I'm fallin' from heaven for I know we're gonna part
The fall may not kill me but it's bound to break my heart
Yes lovers to losers you made that clear
I walked in a laughing but I'm leaving with tears
I'm fallin' from heaven...

Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
Oh, when the sun, refuses to shine
I still, want to be in that number
When the sun refuses to shine
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
I'm going to sing aloud and thunder
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Yes, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

You are my destination
I have to call
'cause you have so much on the ball
Ah you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
Well you hit the spot
Like pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly don't know exactly what it is that you've got
But you hit the spot
You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a sunny day
You hit the spot
In my estimation ....

If I should love again
If I should love again
I'll give my love to nobody else but you
You've been so dear to me
You've made things clear to me
And I can see the wonderful dreams come true
When hearts are broken
And romance ends
One tender word of love is spoken and then it mends
So here's to love again
If I should love again
I'll give my love to nobody else but you
So here's to love again
If I should love again
I'll give my love to nobody else but you

Face club, pal I went and fished with my fly I stepped to the urinal When i noticed a guy He was punishin' the bishop I'ze tryin' to get a stain off And zeroed in on my pride But i'm afraid i had to make the peeper die The subtle comedy amused me You're in my sockable face club You gotta punchable face, bub Grab him, nab him You gotta a sockable face Everything you do makes me feel like you need to get a blackened eye Then there was heard a symphony of punchin' It shattered his glass jaw Woke up in blood and beer and munchin' On some red tongue slaw He kind of laid there burblin' and there arose a stench Then something caramelized on his pants Like a million baby diapers You gotta punchable face, bub You're in my sockable face club You are a sockable guy who how can i say What i want to get through to you Pal, punch you in the eggs and make 'em runny Your mama's face in my locket I learned from larry, mo, and curly Get up and gallop and go Your friends are diggin' the ho' Not to take no guff Who likes to play rough I'm a semper fi, the kind of guy But sneaky peeky got me surly Drama, drama, drama, drama -- your face Hey, there guys step aside, the cleanin' guy is here Clean up blood and beer To lay that mop and bucket down He needs a cigarette 'cause he hates work And he has to put up with a lot of jerks You're in my sockable face club You gotta punchable face, bub You're a disgrace to the human race You got a stupid look on your face

I was up this mornin'
Ah, the blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin'
Ah, the blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues
Give me your right hand
Blues fell mama's child
Tore me upside down
The blues fell mama's child
And it tore me upside down
Travel on, poor Bob
Just can't turn you 'round
The blues
Is a low-down shakin' chill
The blues
Is a low-down shakin' chill
I hope you never had that
I hope you never will
Well, the blues
An achin' old heart disease
The blues
An achin' old heart disease
Like consumption
It's killing me by degrees
I can study the rain
Oh, oh, I'll drive my blues, drive it
I been studyin' the rain
And I wanna drive my blues
I'm goin' to the 'stil'ry
Stay out there all day long
You're gonna do it?
Preachin'
Tell me 'bout it

My life was empty when you went away
Even the blue skies above had turned gray
E3ut now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
Those little quarrels that tore us apart
Oh, gee, I can see
They were wrong from the start
But now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay

Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
[Chorus]
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves,
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves,
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze
By and by the harvest, and the labor ended,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
[Chorus]
Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves
When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
[Chorus]

It was up at Mike's the other night,
There was really quite a sight,
Gather round, folks, while I give you all the lowdown.
Tables were filled with bloody frails,
Chewing on their fingernails;
They were waiting for the man from Harlem.
Drinks were served six bits a throw,
Things were moving kind of slow,
Everybody's nerves were getting jumpy.
All at once the room was still,
Men forgot all about their bill,
Who should enter but the man from Harlem.
Everybody rolled their eyes,
Women starting heaving sighs,
Someone hollered, Music, lights and gin,
Everybody cleared a space,
They had big, broad smiles on every face,
How they all loved to see the man from Harlem.
When he started in to step
He filled everyone with plenty pep,
He twitched and squirmed; it just was a dirty shame.
Everyone was in a daze,
Women watched him with amaze,
Each one said she'd have the man from Harlem.
He looked over in the corner,
And saw a couple of frails
And they sure did look kinda low.
Another cat walked up, and said to the man from Harlem,
Go over there and see what's the matter with them girls.
And they said, I'm kinda low.
And he said, I've got just what you need:
Come on, sisters, light up on these weeds and get high
And forget about everything

Look out the window when that rain storm
I let the wind blow up a brain storm
And now I'm wondering
Whether weather like this gets you too
It may go on like this for hours
Too late in fall for April showers
So what we got here, got a thought or two
I need to share with you, here goes
Darling, tell me now
Have I done wrong somehow
That you won't look at me
Need it pointed out
Can't keep my wits about
When you won't look at me
Is there something I oughta know?
You're finding hard to say
Well, there's just a trace
Hiding on your face
And I've learned it that way
Just another soul
That really knows my soul
And you won't look at me
Does that take the prize?
How much I love those eyes
And they won't look at me
Now the rain has gone
But something lingers on
There's certain sadness here
Now that the sky is clear
And it's so, so clear
Yes, it's all so clear to me now
And I can't help but fear
That certain sadness here to stay

We seem like passing strangers now
How can you hurry by
There were never two who loved
Half as much as you and I
We seem like passing strangers now
Funny how things can change
We were so inseparable
Now you're acting very strange
The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know
If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again
The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know
If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again

I've been down so long
That down don't worry me
I've been down so long
That down don't worry me
I just sit and wonder
Where can my good man be
When it rains in here
It's storming on the sea
When it rains in here
It's storming on the sea
Every time I come here
Everything happens to me
I lose my man
I lose my head
I lose my money
Feel like I'm almost dead
I need you honey
Need you bad as can be

Mais Feliz
(Lyrics by Cazuza)
O nosso amor não vai parar de rolar
De fugir e seguir como um rio
Como uma pedra que divide o rio
Me diga coisas bonitas
O nosso amor não vai olhar para trás
Desencantar nem ser tema de livro
A vida inteira eu quiz um verso simples
Prá tranformar o que eu digo
Rimas fáceis, calafrios
Fura o dedo, faz um pacto comigo
Um segundo seu no meu
Por um segundo mais feliz
Translation:
Happier
Our love is never going to stop
Running away and flow like a river
Like a stone dividing the river
Tell me beautiful things
Our love won't look back
Disenchant or be the theme of a book
My whole life I searched for a simple verse
To transform what I am saying
Easy rimes, goose bumps
Pinch a finger, make a pact with me
A second of yours on mine
Happier for a second

I wake up every morning with a smile on my face
Everything in it's place as it should be
I start out every morning just as free as the breeze
My cares upon the shelf
Because I find myself with
No strings and no connections
No ties to my affections
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
No dates that can't be broken
No words that can't be spoken
Especially when I am feeling romancy
Like a robin upon a tree
Like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody
I'm free, that's me
So
Bring on the big attraction
My decks are cleared for action
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy

There's only one cloud in the sky
There's only one cloud in the sky
And it's hanging, hanging round over my head
The weather man said It could change
The weather man said it could change
But it looks like my dark cloud is here to stay
Lightening strikes me down
Lightening strikes me down
Shakes me up and puts me down to the ground
I feel so alive
I feel so alive
There's only, only one cloud in the sky
I love this cloud of mine
I love this cloud of mine
It's a crazy, a crazy thing to say
If my cloud should ever go
If my cloud should ever go
My life, my life would never be the same.

Can you help me I'm a pagan
in this land of isolation
I want love,I want life,I want freedom,keep on trying
As a child I was a servant
as a young man was still working
for the kingdom of the steeple
who gave nothing to the people
You got one shot take it or not you let it run,
I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun
Put your cards out on the table
wash your mind of those old old fables
that's enough rhinestone halo's
read the fine print on the label
You got one shot take it or not you let it run, you let it run
I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun
in the butt of your stun gun.
now the price is getting higherthrow yourself into the fire
no more love, no more life, no more freedom, only crying
You got one shot ready or not let it run, let it run
I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun
You got one shot ready or not you let it run, gonna let it run
cause I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun
in the butt of your stun gun.
One more notch.

(Written by Bebel Gilberto, Carlinhos Brown)
If I could name
A fruit for you
It would be jabuticaba
Blue, black and small
On the outside
And soft and sweet within
My favourite memory
Was under that tree
That's been there since
I was three
Now I would like to
Sing for you
My jabuticaba song
Isn't she lovely
Like purple rain
Walking on sunshine with you
(over the rainbow)
Quiet nights, quiet stars
It's summertime
Quiet nights, quiet stars and you
If I could name
A tree for you
It would be
Jabuticaba
Under the shade
Of the cool green leaves
It all comes back to me
So when that taste
Reminds you
You know just where
To find me
And now I would like to sing for you
My jabuticaba song
Jabuticaba tree
Jabuticaba song

I asked my love to take a walk,
Just a little way's with me.
An' as we walked,
Then we would talk
All about our wedding day.
[Chorus]
"Darlin', say that you'll be mine;
In our home we'll happy be,
Down beside where the waters flow,
On the banks of the Ohio."
I took her by her pretty white hand,
I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
An' watched her as she floated down.
[Chorus]
Returnin' home between twelve and one,
Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;
I'd killed the girl
I love, you see,
Because she would not marry me.
The very next day, at half past four,
The sheriff walked right to my door;
He says, "Young man,
Don't try to run.
You'll pay for this awful crime you've don."
[Chorus]

Ok, so your heart is broken
You're sitting around mopin',
Mopin', mopin', cryin', cryin'
You say you're even thinking about dying
Well, before you do anything rash,
Baby, listen to this
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
But there's no guarantee that
The one you love, is gonna love you
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see
A certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean,
It clouds you're mind with emotion
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
How can you help it,
When the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see,
You're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do,
Next time around someone cries for you
Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school,
I want to say it again,
Everybody plays the fool
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
Every plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I want to say it again
Everybody plays the fool

Down in old Kentucky where horseshoes are lucky
There's a village smithy standin' under the chestnut tree
Hear the hammer knockin', see the anvil rockin'
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes
See the hot sparks a-flyin' like fourth of July-in'
He's even got the horses cloppin' pop, down the avenue
Folks love the rhythm, the clang bangin' rhythm
You'll get a lot of kicks out of the blacksmith blues

Folks love the rhythm, the clang bangin' rhythm
You'll get a lot of kicks out of the blacksmith blues
Out of the blacksmith blues
Out of the blacksmith blues
Hammer knockin', anvil rockin'
Horses cloppin', pops are boppin'
The blacksmith blues

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
(We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land)
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
(There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray)
(It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day)
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Whoo, whoo there now
Steady, easy, whoo, everybody out

No-good man
Lovin' all the no-good things
Never treats me as he should
That ain't good
He's always bringing me down
He's no saint
Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly
Not on me
I'm the one who gets the run around
I ought to hate him and yet I love him so
For I require
Love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find
I always get that kind
No-good man
Ever since the world began
There have been other fools like me
Born to be
In love with a no-good man
I ought to hate him and yet I love him so
For I require
Love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find
I always get that kind
No-good man
Ever since the world began
There have been other fools like me
Born to be
In love with a no-good man

The girl of my dreams is the sweetest girl
Of all the girls I know
Each sweet co-ed like a rainbow trail
Fades in the afterglow
The blue of her eye and the gold of her hair
Are a blend of the western sky
And the moonlight beams on the girl of my dreams
She's the sweetheart of Sigma Chi
Oh, the blue of her eye and the gold of her hair
Are a blend of the western sky
And the moonlight beams on the girl of my dreams
She's the sweetheart of Sigma Chi

Gosh, it's such a hoot to see them quaking
When I'm king they'll treat me with respect
I can't wait to watch their poor hearts breaking
So much for politically correct
Up 'til now I've pulled my punches
I intend to eat their lunches
No more Mr. Nice Guy, not for me
If you think that I'm hard-hearted
Well, let me by, I haven't even started
No more Mr. Nice Guy, no siree
Soon as my witchcraft has zinged them
I'll gain control of the kingdom
As for Odette, well that's tragic
Cause I'm going back to that old black magic
Good behavior is so much duller
Time to show my one true color
Baby, Mr. Nice Guy's history
Vengeance is what I believe in
I don't get mad, I get even
Odette can't get to the ball 'cause I won't bring her
So I'll zap up a date who's a real dead ringer
Up to no good, I love plottin'
Cause I'm so good when I'm rotten
No more Mr. Nice Guy, wait and see (wait and see)
I'll become that nasty, naughty, very spiteful
Wicked, wayward, way delightful
Bad guy I was born to be
One more time
Lying, loathsome, never tender
Indiscreet repeat offender
No more Mr. Nice Guy, that's not me

Glad to get high and see the slow motion world
Just to reach, and touch, the half notes floating
Worlds spinning orbit quicker than 9/8ths Dave Brubeck
We come now, frantically searching for Thomas Moore, rainbow villages
Up on suddenly, Charlie Mingus and our man Abdul Malik
to add bass, to a bottomless pit of insecurity
You may be plastic because you never meditate
about the bottom of glasses, The third side of your universe
Add on Alice Coltrane and her cosmic strains
Still no vocal on blue black horizons
Your plasticity is tested by a formless assault
The sun can answer questions in tune, to all your sacrifices
But why would our new jazz age give us no more mind expanding puzzles?
Enter John
Blow from under, always, and never, so that the morning, the sun
may scream of brain bending saxophones
The third world arrives, with Yusef Lateef, and Pharaoh Saunders
With oboes straining to touch the core of your unknown soul
Ravi Shankar comes, with strings attached, prepared to stabilize your seventh sense
Your black rhythm
Up and down a silly ladder run the notes, without the words
Words are important for the mind, but the notes are for the soul
Miles Davis, So what
Cannonball, Fiddler, Mercy
Dexter Gordon, One Flight Up
Donald Byrd, playing Cristo, but what about words?
Would you like to survive on sadness? Call on Ella and Jose Happiness
Drift with Smokey, Bill Medley, Bobby Taylor, and Otis Redding.
Soul music where frustrations are washed by drums, Nina and Miriam
Congo, Mongo, Beat me, senseless, bongo, Tonto
Flash through dream worlds of STP and LSD
Speed kills and sometimes musics call, is frustrated
And the black man is confused
Our speed is our life pace, much too fast, not good
I beg you to escape, and live, and hear all of the real
Until a call comes for you to cry elsewhere
We must all cry, but tell me
Must our tears be white?

Just because I love you
Doesn't mean I don't get mad
It just means I won't stay mad for long
Just because I love you
Doesn't mean I don't have bad days
Sometimes I wanna be alone
Just because I love you
Doesn't mean I'm a robot
I am a human being with feelings
Oh, let me get this straight
You got an attitude
'Cause I don't wanna do things your way
I can't believe this, I don't need this
I'mma find somebody that's gonna love me
When I'm not pretty when I don't look my best
When I don't feel like I gotta have an S on my chest
Have an S on my chest
Yes S on my chest
I can't be supa all the time
Sup so so supa
Sup so so supa
Sup so so, sup so so, sup so so supa
Just because I'm your lady
Don't mean you can't treat me like a baby
Sometimes rock me to sleep in your arms
You call me a woman
But every now and then
I wanna feel like a little girl
Don't I make your world better?
Don't I make you feel better?
Oh baby ain't my love the best you ever had?
So why you gotta do me like that that
Oh, let me get this straight
You got an attitude
'Cause I don't wanna do things your way
I can't believe this, I don't need this
I'mma find somebody that's gon' love me
When I'm not pretty when I don't look my best
When I don't feel like I gotta have an S on my chest
Have an S on my chest
Yes S on my chest
I can't be supa all the time
I know I'm extraordinary
But you can't expect me
To be on 10 all the time
I'd lose my mind
Yea, I could go crazy
Wearing this S all day
Across my chest all day, I'm sayin'
Oh, let me get this straight
You got an attitude
'Cause I don't wanna do things your way
I can't believe this, I don't need this
I'mma find somebody that's gon' love me
When I'm not pretty when I don't look my best
When I don't feel like I gotta have an S on my chest
Have an S on my chest
Yes S on my chest
I can't be supa all the time
Sup so so supa
Sup so so supa, supa
Sup so so supa
Gotta be somewhere all the time, baby
Sup so so supa
Sup so so supa
I can't be supa all the time
When I'm not pretty when I don't look my best
When I don't feel like I gotta have an S on my chest
S on my chest

He got all of his money tied up in guitars
His poster hangin up at an east side bar
Sets his tip bucket up by the microphone stand
He don't think about it, he's a rock n roll man
I tried to run him off and set the record straight
He said girl you know better now, we're soulmates
Only one speaker working and his amp's blown out
Doesn't get what the hell the Grateful Dead is about
Wears a gold lightening bolt in one of his ears
Likes to talk about Elvis, but only in the Sun years
He got sheets over the windows and records on the floor
A poster of Jimi Hendrix on his bedroom door
He didn't go to college but he's read a lot of books
Married one time for money and one time for looks
There's always fist-fightin and drama in the band
Over cigarette ashes in a Budweiser can
Left town one time and didn't call me for 3 days
But he lets me know he loves me in other ways
Got my name spelled out in a dagger a tattoo
Says I'm the only woman that he can talk to
Thinks Brando and The Wild One and The Mystery Train
Are proof that rock n roll cannot be explained
Owes all kinds of money, but don't believe in debt
He'll be the first to tell ya, it ain't over yet
Sometimes we're Sid and Nancy or Courtney and Kurt
We get higher than heaven we get lower than dirt
It's the fightin' and the lovin' that make it work
Too lazy to be mean, and too mean to hurt
Make up and take me shopping at the Southern Thrift
Thanks the devil for his story and God for his gift
He got all of his money tied up in guitars
His poster hangin up at an east side bar
Sets his tip bucket up by the microphone stand
He don't think about it, he's a rock n roll man
He's a rock n roll man
He's my rock n roll man

I'm gonna get up in the mornin',
I believe I'll dust my broom [Repeat: x2]
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin',
Girlfriend, can get my room
I'm gon' write a letter,
Telephone every town I know [Repeat: x2]
If I can't find her in West Helena,
She must be in East Monroe, I know
I don't want no woman,
Wants every downtown man she meet [Repeat: x2]
She's a no good doney,
They shouldn't 'low her on the street
I believe, I believe I'll go back home [Repeat: x2]
You can mistreat me here, babe,
But you can't when I go home
And I'm gettin' up in the morning,
I believe I'll dust my broom [Repeat: x2]
Girlfriend, the black man that you been lovin',
Girlfriend, can get my room
I'm gon' call up Chiney,
She is my good girl over there [Repeat: x2]
If I can't find her on Philippine's Island,
She must be in Ethiopia somewhere

Santa, make him love me
Santa, just help me
Tell me I'll be loved
I need a lover to call my mine
I adore him
Can't ignore him
Always on my mind
Don't you know the man's so fine
I've been good
I've behaved like I should
I've done all I could
Whatever he wants from me
Whatever he needs I'll be
Just set him beneath my tree
He's my Christmas fantasy
And that's all I need
I'm begging you, Santa please
Slide him down my chimney
He's my Christmas fantasy
Santa, my one wish
Top of my list
Is our first Christmas kiss
Is something that I can't resist
Santa, maybe
I'll be his baby
I've got to make him mine
There's nothing like a love divine
And I've been good
I've behaved like I should
Santa, if you would
Whatever he wants from me
Whatever he needs I'll be
Just set him beneath my tree
He's my Christmas fantasy
And that's all I need
I'm begging you, Santa please
Slide him down my chimney
He's my Christmas fantasy
Whatever he wants from me
Whatever he needs I'll be
Just set him beneath my tree
He's my Christmas fantasy
And that's all I need
I'm begging you, Santa please
Slide him down my chimney
He's my Christmas fantasy
I love him, yes I do
Yeah I'm begging, begging you
Send him all to me
Please
Santa, can I, Santa, can I have a man?
Will you understand?

O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!

Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby done left this town
Oh the sun shinin' all day long
But the rain it just keeps on comin' down
She's my life I need her so
Why she left I just don't know
Forty days and forty nights
Since I sat right down and cried
It keeps on rainin' all the time
But the river is runnin' dry
Lord help me it just ain't right
I love that girl with all my might
Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby done broke my heart
I've been searchin' for her everywhere
Just like a blind man in the dark
Love can make a poor man rich
Or break his heart, I don't know which
Forty days and forty nights
Like a ship out on the stormy sea
I've been prayin' for her every night
That she would come back home to me
Life is love and love is light
I hope she comes back home tonight

Away with the music of Broadway
Be off with your Irving Berlin
Oh I give no quarter to Kern or Cole Porter
And Gershwin keeps pounding on tin
How can I be civil when hearing this drivel
It`s only for nightclubbin` souses
Oh give me the free `n` easy waltz that is Vienneasy and
Go tell the band If they want a hand
The waltz must be Strauss`s
Ya, ya ya, give me oom-pa-pah
When I want a melody
Lilting through the house
Then I want a melody
By Strauss
It laughs, it sings, the world is in rhyme
Swinging to three-quarter time
Let the Danube flow along
And the Fledermauss
Keep the wine and give me song
By Strauss
By Jove, by Jing, by Strauss is the thing
So I say to ha-cha-cha, heraus!
Just give me your oom-pa-pah, by Strauss!
Let the Danube flow along
And the Fledermauss
Keep the wine and give me song
By Strauss
By Jove, by Jing, by Strauss is the thing
So I say to ha-cha-cha, heraus!
Just give me your oom-pa-pah,

Now i'm mean and evil, don't you mess around with me,
yes i'm mean and evil, don't you mess around with me,
'cause i'll mess you up with a bang, a dozen sticks of
tnt!
Frst thing each mornin', i breaks me a lookin' glass,
then i goes out on the corner, waits for a black cat to
pass.
can't sleep while there's a howlin' dog 'neath my window
each night,
And nothin' sends me like a good bloody fight!
yes i'm mean and evil,
but you no-good men made me that way!
Yes i'm mean and evil, even rain don't fall on me,
yes i'm so mean and evil, even rain don't fall on me,
and i'm gonna stay that way till i find a man that's
meaner than me!

You're my man, you're so nice and brown
Sweetest man in this town
I heard you say you was goin' away
And leave me here to stay
I feel like I could cry
And here's the reason why
Daddy, you really know your stuff
When you take me for a buggy ride
I like you when you got your habits on
You can shift your gear with so much pride
I gets a funny feelin'
When you gaze into my eyes
You give me so much thrill
You make my thermometer rise
I'm happy when you're by my side
When you take me for a buggy ride
Daddy, you're as sweet as you can be
When you take me for a buggy ride
When you set me down up on your knee
And ask me to be your bride
When you hug and kiss me
It makes me feel fine
I gets this funny feelin'
Up and down my spine
You don't need no teachin', you don't need no guide
When you take me for a buggy ride
Your lovin' ain't so forte in the park
But you a lovin', poor creature in the dark
You ain't so hot, what can it be
That makes me say? "Daddy, take all of me"
You always ready every time that I call
What I like about you, you never stall
You ain't no preacher, you a good old soul
You done sent salvation to my very soul
I can't kick but I'm satisfied
When you take me for a buggy ride

GOT TO GET BACK
GOT TO GET BACK
GET TO THE PLACE I BELONG
IT'S BEFORE
FOR TOO LONG
YOU KNOW A TRAGESTY
THE WAY
WITHOUT YOU
WITHOUT
CAN YOU DO THAT
AND SO
ASKING YOU THAT
PLEASE
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE IT

It's the Booker-man, y'all
Can you dig it
Yeah, yeah, that's it man
Can you dig it
That's what I'm talkin' about
Can you dig it
Can you dig it, sucka
Can you dig it
Yeah, it's all real
You can find me center stage, center of attention
Booker T's here like Vin Diesel triple x-ing
On the count of three, I want you all to spit it,
One, two, three, can you dig it, sucka
Five time's the champ, more the man
Scuffle with me, not a good plan
Gotta show the world a better way for the youth
All eyes on me, Booker T's the truth
Whatever the state, wherever you at
Booker put it down man, simple as that
Booker ain't hating, ain't dissin' a thing
No more drama in my life, feel the vibe I bring
Don't be fooled because he bruised
Booker T the type to come speak at cha school
Wherever you at, I talk it like I walk it
I walk it like I live it
If you know the words, hit it
Can you dig it, sucka
Ever since Harlem Heat, hard to beat
WCW Champ, plus four repeats
Want to get down? You're gonna lay down
When you lay down, you're gonna stay down
Want to know 'bout my life, it's an open book
Most can't make it down the road I took
Booker made a change in his life, just like Mase
Now Booker get respect when he come in the place
Man this ain't about guns and drugs and ill thugs
This is bout makin' it better for lil' 'cause
Can you dig it, sucka, understand the way
Booker so humble, in this concrete jungle
Right or wrong I rumble, till the wrong tumble
From giants to midgets, Can you dig it
Larger than life, but it's no movie
I'm the true master of the spinaroonie
Can you dig it, sucka

I'm counting wallpaper roses all around the room
Wallpaper roses painted with gloom
I've been so heartsick and lonely watching the door
Crying my heart out pacing the floor
I'm counting wallpaper roses over and over again
I've counted two thousand six hundred and ten
You are the only one come back and bring the sun
And make my wallpaper roses bloom again
I'm counting wallpaper roses over and over again
And make my wallpaper roses bloom again

You think that no one understands
When you don't feel strong hey
I got an answer for you
There's a way that's light and easy, it's true
He knows when you fall, So get up and go on
And I want you to know that you don't have to go all alone
[Chorus]
Even with tears in your eyes
Count it all joy until the time
Until you make it through the storm
Turn from your past say goodbye
Remember you were crucified with Christ
You were crucified with Christ
Yea oh yea, so let the weak say I'm strong, yea yea
So read the word renew your mind oh, oh When they tried to remind you
The road you use to travel
Can be a distant memory, You decide
The wind and the waves, Stare you in the face
Put on your armor, And don't run away
I know that Jesus is there
So just cast all your care, It will be alright
And when you know you got a weakness
He will be strong, On that day you will say
You belong in the presence of the Lord
So let Him reign, let Him reign, let Him reign in your heart, in your heart
[Chorus]

Ooo, all over nothing at all
You built me up to a waterfall
We made up and then
Quarreled again
All over nothing at all
You pinned a note to the wall
I thought at least you would call
But I never heard
Not even a word
All over nothing at all
If you ever come back
Well, I'd be so nice to you
If you never come back
I'll be with the crazies
Pushing up the daisies
I watch the clock on the wall
Wait for your step in the hall
It's hard to conceive
Hard to believe
It's all over nothing at all
Ooo, all l over nothing at all
You built me up to a waterfall
We made up and then
All over again
All over nothing at all
You pinned a note to the wall
I thought at least you would call
But I never heard
Not even a word
All over nothing at all
If you ever come back
I'd be so nice to you
If you never come back
I'd be with the crazies
Pushing up the daisies
I watch the clock on the wall
Wait for your step in the hall
Say, it's hard to conceive
Hard to believe
It's over and we're all through
It's hard to conceive
Hard to believe
It's all over nothing at all
All over nothing at all

You I love
The kind of passion you fashion cannot be explained
You I love
You're so appealing the feeling cannot be contained
And when I touch you
There's no denying the flying I do into space
You're just too much, you
The simple case is your face, is the face of faces
You I need
Not only merely I'm clearly a person bereft
Yes indeed
I'd draw the curtain for certain if you ever left
And if I stammer
Forgive my grammar
You got me winging, no wonder I'm singing
It's you I love
You I need
Not only merely I'm clearly a person bereft
Yes indeed
I'd draw the curtain for certain if you ever left
And if I stammer
It's 'cause I dig glamour
You got me winging, no wonder I'm singing
It's you I love [Repeat x 2]

Only paid attention in your lessons
I Sat close at the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn't speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So looking back I don't know how I handled it, yeah
Futile frustration in my head
[Chorus]
I can't help but analyze your actions,
Neglecting mine
Before I know I've fallen hard
And now I tread water in time
Hated it when I saw them together
I sat around waiting for shit to end
Unconsciously I tried to sabotage it
To get revenge on my best friend
Because I was in love with him before her
I had just cause to grieve
So not long after she broke up with him
I got my closure on new years eve
[Chorus: x2]
I love all the bickering and insults
And when I shout at you and you smile
Making coffee while my mind spills over
How I catch your art once in a while
Shouldn't I have grown a little wiser?
Why haven't I learned my lesson yet?
And although I have made my love progresses
I tend to learn as much as I forget
[Chorus: x3]

Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Made me loose my happy home
Made me loose my happy home
Whiskey endless women
Is driving me out of my mind
Every time I get a lover that's tough you know
I think I'm doin' just fine
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Made me loose my happy home
Made me loose my happy home

Finally knocked myself outta sight

And almost started a fight
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey

There's hidden persuasion within your eyes
Your charming indifference is but a disguise
I would be glad to love you if love is in the deal
But I must feel quite certain that the love is so real
Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires the element of chance
Here's hoping at least we'll find romance
Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires that element of chance
Here's hopin' at least we'll find romance
Here is hoping at least we'll find romance

We want to leave you happy
Don't want to leave you sad
We want to leave you happy
Don't want to leave you sad

But don't want to sing them bad
Roy wailed for you
He wailed the blues tonight
Roy wailed for you

He wailed, he wailed, he wailed 'em just right
He talked about a mean woman

Talked about a mean woman

I've got my chance to talk about a man
I'll talk about he
He was good to me
He was good
He was good to me
Whoa, so good

But I know somewhere
There's a little bit of soul in ella
There's a little bit of soul in me
There's a little bit of soul in ella
There's a little bit of soul in me
Oh somewhere down the line
I've had misery
Every woman gets misery
Every woman is crying
Every woman has misery
Every woman is crying
Crying 'bout a man
And the way he did her wrong
I had one too

With this happy music
This happy music
So I'd better leave while I'm happy
And say good night to you
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

Hey, hey, say Ladeo
Time for taking words away
The melody will tell the story
As we go along
Riding a wave of a thousand stories
Starlit journeys of morning glories
Where your long lost dreams are suddenly awake
Summoning a prayer, didn't even know was there
Say Ladeo
A song becomes a thousand songs
Hey, hey, say Ladeo
Time we took the words away
We're getting to somewhere closer
That's hidden inside
Words only take you so far and leave you
Wondering just what it was you meant to
Say what you would say if your heart led the way
Take away the words, letting all the sounds just play
Say Ladeo
A song becomes a thousand songs
And each and every heart
Brings life and times and rhymes along
All the dreams you never knew were there
Sound and feeling, melody and prayer
Say Ladeo
Words only take you so far and leave you
Wondering what it was you meant to
Say what you would, say what you would
Say if you could let your heart just lead the way
Say Ladeo
A song becomes a thousand songs
A prayer becomes a song
So sing out loud or whisper low

All along the way there were things to do
Always some other someone I could be
Other things to know, other ways to go
To fly a spirit for the play to show
It wasn't always easy learning to be me
Sometimes my hitting hard would disagree
Times I walked away other times I stay
To see the glamour of my life the play
Being me I dared to be myself alone
Sometimes I love the things they said
Some things were cold as stone it was lonely
Sometimes, sometimes it was mood-felt lights were brilliant
Sometimes, sometimes there was you being me, I laugh
So many things have changed and yet somehow
There were always be a stage, a song for me
Hold the curtain open, It's time to take a bow
Being me I laugh seeing now and then
So many things have changed and get some out
There will always be a stage, a song for me
Hold the curtain open, It's time to take a bow

"Romance is a game for fools"
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
"Romance is a game for fools"
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in
Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ahh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Deep rhythm captivates me
Hot rhythms stimulate me
Can't help but swing it boy
Swing it brothers swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on swing me boy
Swing it brothers swing
Raring to go and there ain't nobody
Gonna hold me down
Say listen boy
Hurry up and send me
Let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on kill me boy
Swing it brothers swing
Deep rhythms captivate me
Hot rhythms stimulate me
Can't help but swing it boy
Swing it brothers swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on send me Count
Swing it brothers swing
Rarin' to go and there ain't nobody
Gonna hold me down
Say listen boy
Hurry up and send me
Let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on swing me Count
Swing it brothers swing

Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me
Tell me I'm great and I'll be greater
Build me up and I'll fly
Love me now and I'll be glad later
And tell your trouble goodbye
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me
Spill that cup of trouble and sorrow
Sooner better for you
Fill it up with a happy tomorrow
We got some living to do
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me
Cover me up and I'll squeeze tighter
Honey let's kiss me do
That good good loving makes a bad bad fighter
And I'm not picking on you
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me
Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

It's okay in the day
I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty
I stay up, clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up
And I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him (before him, I)
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone

I could have told you she would hurt you,
She'd love you awhile and desert you,
If only you'd asked I could have told you so!
I could have saved you some crying,
Yes, I could have told you she was lying,
But you were in love and you didn't want to know.
I hear her now as I toss and turn and try to sleep,
I hear her now making promises she'll never keep;
And now it's over and done with,
She'll find someone new to have fun with!
Through all of my tears I could have told you so.
And now it's over and done with,
She'll find someone new to have fun with!
Through all of my tears I could have told you so,
Through all of my tears I could have told you so.

You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
My car's outside
But before I go I'd like to say
What's on my mind and why
You got to know I just can't stay
If it's true what they say
'Bout your good thing going away
Then you'll be crying water all alone
Soon as you realize that what you had is gone
And you'll be trying not to make it harder
So you'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
Now you know you're wrong
But it's much too late to make it right
It won't be long
Before you understand this is goodbye
'Cause it's true what they say
'Bout your good thing goin' away
Then you'll be crying water all alone
Soon as you realize that what you had is gone
And you'll be trying not to make it harder
So you'll be crying water
Then you'll be crying water all alone
Soon as you realize that what you had is gone
And you'll be trying not to make it harder
So you'll be crying water
And like a dying man without a drop to drink
On the desert sand in the burning heat
He thinks of all the days when his thirst was quenched
Now he prays for shade and just pretends
'Cause it's true what they say
'Bout your good thing goin' away
Then you'll be crying water all alone
Soon as you realize that what you had is gone
And you'll be trying not to make it harder
So you'll be crying water
Then you'll be crying water all alone
Soon as you realize that what you had is gone
And you'll be trying not to make it harder
So you'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water
You'll be crying water water
You'll be crying water

Deep and dark are my true love's eyes,
Blacker still is the winter's turning,
As the sadness of parting proves.
And brighter now is the lantern burning
That lightens my path to love.
No fiddle tune will take the air,
But I will see his swift feet dancing
And the swirl of his dark brown hair,
His smiling face and his dark eyes glancing
As we stepped out Blinkbonny Fair.
And if my waiting prove in vain,
Then I will pack and track ever take me.
The long road will ease my pain.
No jewel of mankind would ever make me
Whisper love's words again.
For in drink I'll seek good company,
My ears will ring with the tavern's laughter,
And I'll hear not his last sweet sigh.
And who's to know in the morning after
How I long for his dear dark eyes
How I long for his dear dark eyes
How I long for his dear dark eyes

Say it with your actions
Saying those words to me
Doesn't mean a thing to me
I don't wanna hear them
Baby you can keep those three
You might as well not even speak
Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Then you'd say it
And I'd forget everything
Well I'm sorry to report
That's not working anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean
No more "I'm sorry"
"I love you"
I need proof
Baby boy it's all in what you do
(no more)I love you
If it's true baby boy
It's all in what you do
Say it with your actions
Say it in the way you touch
And the things that you do for us
I don't wanna be mean
But when it comes to this love
Saying it ain't enough
Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Then you'd say it
And I'd forget everything
Well I'm sorry to report
That's not working anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean
No more "I'm sorry"
"I love you"
I need proof
Baby boy it's all in what you do
(no more)I love you
If it's true baby boy
It's all in what you do
It's in what you
It's it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do
No more "I'm sorry"
"I love you"
I need proof
Baby boy it's all in what you do
(no more)I love you
(baby) If it's true baby boy
It's all in what you do
It's in what you
It's it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do

Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I shall ever win
And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind
When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know
When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know

Love and kisses
Never misses
Making a heaven for two
With a tender
Sweet surrender
Coming from someone like you
Your perfection
To affection
Creates a perfect design
Love has bound us
Joy has found us
Planning a future divine
No indecision
I know that my vision
Is clear
When you are near
No need for sunlight
For you are the one light
I see
So real to me
Love and kisses
That's what bliss is
Lighting whatever you do
Whole completeness
Blessed sweetness
Coming from someone like you

You keep running away
Though I beg you not to leave
But still you won't stay
Darlin' you keep running away
Tear my heart apart every step of the way
You're here today and gone tomorrow
Leavin' this heart of mine in sorrow
Now you come around every now and then
Long enough to hurt me, and then you're gone again
Darlin' you, you keep running away
Oh, I begged you not to leave, you never stay
Now you, you keep running away
Leavin' me here to face another lonely day
To you all of this is just a game
But each time you came here, I feel the pain
But I've got so much love for you
I keep wanting you, no matter what you do
All I want to do is take care of you
Everything I have in my life, I'll share with you
This soul of mine has been possessed by you
Darling my heart has been obsessed with you
Just look at me, I'm not the man, I used to be
I used to be proud, I used to be strong
But all of that's changed girl, since you come along
Your lovin' sweetness is my weakness
Though I need you, dear, I just can't keep you near
Running away, running away, running away
Running away, running away, running away
Each time you go, the hurt comes callin'
My days become nights, darlin'
My nights become so much longer
You're in my life, you're in my heart
But I can't get you, get you into my arms
Darlin' you, you keep runnin' away
Darlin' you, you just keep runnin' away

Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
I've been runnin' behind a train
I never could keep satisfied
Appetite for destruction
Keeps a man bound and tied
Oh, shine you goodness down on ? me
Oh Lord from up above
In my darkest hour
Soon be, it's Your turn to love
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
Mother, Johnny used to tell me
Said, "Son, don't waste your youth
As blinding of fear and hatred
And you never ever see the truth"
Oh Lord, I keep prayin' ? wisdom
And the strength to carry on
Oh Lord, be my helper
Let Thine will in my life be done
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
Come on and steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
Come on, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall
Don't let me, steer me right, sweet Jesus
Be my all in all
Steer me right, sweet Jesus
Steer me right, don't let me fall

Sweet little mama, come along, why don't you swing that thing?
Lordy, Lordy, oh my Lord, do that nasty swing.
I know you can, 'cause I'm a nasty man.
Did you mean it when you told me you had the nasty swing? Something tells me, sweet little gal, you've got everything.
Wind my motor, honey; I've got a double spring.
Place a needle in that hole and do that nasty swing.
(Yodel)
(Dobro Solo)
My gal drives a Packard car; she bought me a diamond ring.
She showed me how to do that thing they call the nasty swing. She's my pal, my little nasty gal.
Did you mean it when you told me you had the nasty swing? Something tells me, sweet little gal, you've got everything.
Wind my motor, honey; I've got a double spring.
Place a needle in that hole and do that nasty swing.

Hands across the table while the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips
Tell me what I want to know
Hands across the table meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way
That you belong to me
Hands across the table while the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips
Tell me all I want to know
Hands across the table meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way
That you belong to me

Without a warning you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark, said your love for me was dyin'
Come on baby, baby please come on baby, cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me shine on your love light
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine
When I get lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darlin' to make things all right
So come on baby, baby please and I'm beggin' you baby cause I'm on my knees,
Turn on your lights let it shine on me
Turn on your love light let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Without a warning you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark, shine your love for me was dark
Come on baby, baby please come on baby, cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me shine on your love light
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine

Lullaby and good night with roses bestride
With lilies bedecked 'neath baby's sweet bed
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest
Lullaby and good night, thy mother's delight
Bright angels around, my darling, shall guard
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms
Guten abend, gut' nacht, mit rosen bedacht
Mit nglein besteckt schl'pf unter die deck'
Morgen fr'h, wenn got will, wirst du wieder geweckt
Morgen fr'h, wenn got will, wirst du wieder geweckt
Guten abend, gut' nacht, von englein bewacht
Die zeigen in traum, dir christkindlein's baum
Schlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in traum's paradies
Schlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in traum's paradies
Good evening, good night, covered with roses
With tiny fingernails hidden, slipping under the blankets
Tomorrow morning if God wills, you will wake again
Tomorrow morning if God wills, you will wake again
God evening, good night, watched over by tiny angels
Who show the little Christ child's tree in dreams
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise

The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand, tells me that she's mine
There are many girls who can thrill me and some who can fill me with
Dreams of happiness
But I know I'll never rest until she says she's mine
I'm not afraid she'll leave me cause she's not the kind who'll be unfair
But instead I trust her implicitly
She can go where she wants and go do what she wants, I don't care
The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand and tells me that she's mine
There are many girls who can thrill me and some who can fill me with
Dreams of happiness
But I know I'll never rest until she says she's mine
I'm not afraid she'll leave me cause she's not the kind who'll be unfair
But instead I trust her implicitly
She can go where she wants and go do what she wants, I don't care
The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand and tells me that she's mine

Rain is pouring down
Bills are pourin' in
Talk is gettin' cheap
And trust is wearing thin
But I got a feeling hard times are gonna end
So we got to do what we can
To have some fun again

I work at the Palace ballroom, but gee that palace is cheap
When I get back to my chilly hall room, I'm much too tired to sleep
I'm one of those lady teachers, a beautiful hostess you know
One that the palace features, at exactly a dime a throw.
Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh how they weigh me down.
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys, tough guys who tear my gown.
Seven to midnight I hear drums, loudly the saxophone blows,
Trumpets are tearing my ear-drums, customers crush my toes.
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket,
Come on big boy, ten cents a dance.
Fighters and sailers and bow-legged tailors
Can pay for their tickets & rent me
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbor
Are sweethearts my good luck has sent me
Thought I've a chorus of elderly bows
Stockings are porous with holes at the toes
I'm here till closing time
Dance and be merry it's only a dime
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

You are always in my heart
Even though you're far away
I can hear the music of the song I sang to you
You are always in my heart
And when skies above are gray
I remember that you care and then and there the sun breaks through
Just before I go to sleep
There's a rendezvous I keep
And the dreams I always meet help me forget we're far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear
And my darling 'til we do
You are always in my heart
And the dreams I always meet help me forget were far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear
And my darling 'til we do
You are always in my heart

Oh, come little children
Oh, come one and all
Christmas with its trees and windows all of love
Christmas with its snow and ice and mistletoe
Christmas can't you hear the church bells ringing?
From within can't you hear the choir boy singing?
Oh, silent night, floats up upon the air
Holy night, brings peace and joy everywhere
From your heart let this joyous message come
Peace on earth, merry Christmas all
Christmas with its trees and windows all of love
Christmas with its snow and ice and mistletoe
From your heart let this joyous message come
Peace on earth, merry Christmas all
Merry Christmas

Moments like this thrill me through and through
Careless moments like this close to you
Nonchalantly we'd dine and we'd dance
Yet my heart seems to melt in your grace
Sweet moments like this with the soft lights aglow
Make me long for your kiss though I know
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares

You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee
You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor bent on chivalry
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee
You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't stop us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor intent on chivalry
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee
You know he's alright
You know he's alright with me
He's alright, he's alright (he's an angel)
You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail it right around the seven oceans
Drop it smack dab in the middle of the deep blue sea
Because he's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like the honey, baby, from the bee
He's my baby, you know he's alright

I know a ditty nutty as a fruitcake
Goofy as a goon and silly as a loon
Some call it pretty, others call it crazy
But they all sing this tune:
Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Yes! Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey
Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy"
Oh! Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you-oo?
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

If I only had a match then my cares I'd soon forget
All I'd need would be a match if I had a cigarette
If I had a cigarette I could watch the smoke rings curl
But I'd really be all set if I only had a girl
If I had someone like you to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow we'd know such sweet delight
We could raise a family and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be if I only had a match
If I had someone like you to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow we'd know such sweet delight
We could raise a family and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be if I only had a match

This is the story of a starry night,
The faded glory of a new delight
One breathless meeting,
Two lips repeating
Three precious words that were sweet but fleeting...
When stars are bright my heart keeps wondering why
Our first "goodnight" became our last goodbye
I pray that someday
Love will in some way
Bring back the story of a starry night...

In the dark of deepest night
There comes a haunting sigh
Floating down from somewhere on high,
Oh, what a lonely lullaby
You'll hear a symphony in blue
When ever BOY MEETS HORN,
You'll hear a melody so new when
BOY MEETS HORN
Low and oh,
So sweet that it seems
It's like the mellow music from
Another world of dreams;
You'll hear a strange and tender
Whenever BOY MEETS HORN,
And when the music in the moonlight
Greets the morn,
You'll see him standing way above
The crowd and rockin' on a cloud
Whenever BOY MEETS HORN.
You'll hear a symphony in blue
When ever BOY MEETS HORN,
You'll hear a melody so new when
BOY MEETS HORN
Low and oh,
So sweet that it seems
It's like the mellow music from
Another world of dreams;
You'll hear a strange and tender
Whenever BOY MEETS HORN,
And when the music in the moonlight
Greets the morn,
You'll see him standing way above
The crowd and rockin' on a cloud
Whenever BOY MEETS HORN.

Thrilla in Manilla, Frazier and Ali, can of olives, bag of chips, a case of Genesee
Daddy's unemployment check is all we got; I need a long sleeve helmet just to cover all my thought
Go after the neighbors now you must protect your home
Tears of rage are streaming down your drunken muzzle
Paranoia foaming from the things your brother stole
If you can intimidate then you can control, yeah
Say it to my face
Say it to my face you fuckin' coward
Say it to my face
If you're gonna talk you better say it to my face
I hearted when you farted; it smelled like rubber bands
Is that the sound of boiling fat or is it clappin hands
I'm a little blacker then the other sheep
I dreamed I'ze makin love to dolphins when I'ze dumpin in my sleep
How now say it to my face, I'm in a bad bad way
I'll find a cow and I'll buck it a rodeo
I'll put your battery on my tongue
Go fetch a knife and then off with your thumbs
Say it to my face
Say it to my face you fuckin' coward
Say it to my face
If you're gonna talk you better say it to my face
Face!

I feel the snow
On my eyes
It touches me
Deep inside
And now I'm here
So high
A cloud
Up in the sky
And this has got me thinking
It's all because of you
My heart is dark
And my mouth so dry
Where were you
All this time?
My love is yours
You know
Every song I sing
Belongs to you
And as days like these
Come and go
I still remember
It's true
And this has got me thinking
It's all because of you
The night is dark and the moon so high
Where were you
All this time?
And as days like these
Pass me by
Through clouds or skies of blue
Then upon this heartbeat
I could fly
Just to sing this song for you
For you...

Your cheatin' on me
Cheatin' on me
You're not the kind of a sweetheart I hoped you be
I trusted you thought you'd be true
My love was so strong that I went along
Never dreaming you do me so wrong
Love is a game and I played on the square
But you're the kind who can never play fair
I may forgive but sure as you live
Some day you're gonna be sorry oh you cheated on me
(Don't cry who lied I know all that you've done)
(Each butterfly has to pay for her fun)
I may forgive but sure as you live
Some day you're gonna be sorry you cheated on me
Hah little kidding
You're gonna be sorry sorry you cheated on me
(Cheatin' baby cheatin' baby)
(Both) You cheated on me

Here's a little tune, we're gonna play it for you
T'ain't nothin' to it and it's easy to do
Called the Calloway Boogie
It's the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day
If you like music with a boogie beat
Here's a little ditty that's really all reet
It's the Calloway Boogie
It's the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day
I woke up with the blues the other day
The cats started jamming and they blew 'em away
With the Calloway Boogie
The Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day
We play waltzes, bebop and jive
But here's the kind of music that keeps you alive
It's the Calloway Boogie
It's the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day

Where are you my guiding star.
Did you just vanish from sight
a comet passing in flight.
How could you go
when you must know
how precious and how dear to me you are.
I need you my guiding star.
Without you shining for me
I have no reason to be.
So through the night love
I'll search for your light love.
Where are you
where are you
my guiding star.

Life is like a song to sing
with measured beats and phrases
With bended notes and some repeats
music through the ages
that brings the highs, the lows, the swells
sometimes it's for an ending
bringing other songs to sing
ascending, descending
Learning how to listen
how to hear a melody
how to hear the song I'm singing
how to feel and let it be
and listen to the song
knowing how it goes
and listen for the melody that flows
Music is a lover
with shiny golden wings
that whispers in the lovers' ears
and dances when it sings
and sings in variations
on an everlasting theme
it's either love or sorrow on the scene
I'm learning how to listen
for the songs I name and sign,
and claim as a possession,
and say that they are mine.
'Cause every body knows
that songs come from out of the blue,
and I'm learning how to hear
[the changes too.
I'm learning how to listen
to the rhythm of the night.
How to keep it simple,
how to make it sweet and light.
Smooth and free and easy
or slammin' in a jam
and know for just a moment
the music that I am.
I'm learning how to listen,
how to holler, sing the blues.
I'm learning how to rise above
and wear somebody's shoes.
Learning how to listen
for the song was given me.
I'm learning how to listen and be free.
I'm learning how to listen,
how to hear a melody
how to hear the song I'm singing
how to feel and let it be,
and listen to the song
knowing how it goes
and listen for the melody that flows
and listen for the melody that flows.

Jesus is a friend of mine
He saved my soul
Renewed my mind
Jesus is a friend of mine
Every body say ah oop!
When I am weak he makes me strong
He is my shelter
In the time of storm
When I am weak he makes me strong
Everybody say ah oop!
He will never let me down
He is the best thing
I've ever found
He will never let me down
A friend of mine (follow director)

Blue night and you, alone with me
My heart has never known such ecstasy
Am I on earth, am I in heaven?
Can it be the trees that fill the breeze
With rare and magic perfume?
Oh, no, it isn't the trees, it's love in bloom
Can it be the spring that seems
To bring the stars right into this room?
Oh, no, it isn't the spring, it's love in bloom
My heart was a desert
You planted a seed
And this is the flower
This hour of sweet fulfillment
Is it all a dream, the joy supreme
That came to us in the gloom?
You know it isn't a dream, it's love in bloom
My heart was a desert
But you planted a seed
And this is the flower
This hour of sweet fulfillment
Is it all a dream, the joy supreme
That came to us in the gloom?
You know it isn't a dream, it's love in bloom

Something in your eyes is tryin' to get out
Something in your heart is holding back
What is it that keeps on haunting you, what is that?
I believe in everything you stand for
I believe in everything you do
Tell me what is stopping you from feeling this too
All you say is 'talk to you later'
I don't think you mean that at all
How can I be sure if I'm to leave you alone
Maybe I should mention how I love you
How I'll be around no matter what
If you need to call on me I'll be right there
'Cause whether you're right or wrong
Weathering through the storm
There is a place inside of you
It can change everything
Then all the world can sing
Heavenly love will see us through
It can be so hard to see the blue skies
When you can't see through a cloudy day
Don't let all those old familiar fears in your way
If you need to talk to somebody
Share a secret from your heart
I can be your angel don't go drifting too far
'Cause whether you're right or wrong
Weathering through the storm
There is a place inside of you
It can change everything
Then all the world can sing
Heavenly love will see us through
Seems like there's a miscommunication
About the way we're all supposed to be
Children of the sun come down and help us to see
That we're all together on a journey sharing universal destinies
Open up your soul and let it run wild and free
'Cause whether you're right or wrong
Weathering through the storm
There is a place inside of you
It can change everything
Then all the world can sing
Heavenly love will see us through
La la la la la la
Let all the children sing heavenly love will see us through

(Billy Hill)
'33 Shapiro-Bernstein Music

Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
Young and foolish
We haven't long to be
Soon enough the carefree days
The sunlit days go by
Soon enough the bluebird has to fly
We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreamin' of
Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were young and foolish again
Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain

One, two, three and
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties
Moses took them by the hand
And led them across the barren land
Pharaoh chased them night and day
But the angel of the Lord kept him away
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties
A humble carpenter by trade
You'll know him by the works he made
No towers of stone, no works of steel
But a wooden cross on a wind swept hill
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties
I tell you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, well, He has, yeah, oh yeah
Three nails and two cross ties
No boulevard, no avenue
Not a road by man can carry you
But a highway built by hands unseen
To the city of gold for eternity
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
A mighty, mighty bridge to Heaven
Jesus built a bridge to Heaven
With three nails and two cross ties

wont somebody show me how to dance i wanna dance like i got ants in my pants oh i wanna learn my poor heart yearns

Livin' a dream
Where things are even
Better than they seem
I wanna go
To where the lights
Inside provide the glow
You can believe when
I tell you it's true
Well, take a little ride with me
Can you conceive that
You already knew
Look inside and you
[Chorus]
Love is waiting
It's just around the bend
Waiting for you to turn the
Charm on
Oh, waiting and it will never end
Give it up you're overdue
(Love will see you through)
What'll you do
When all the fancy dancin'
Days are through
Where will you go
When all the neon lights
Have lost their glow
You can believe when
I tell you it's true
Come take a little ride with me
Can you conceive that
You already knew
Look inside and you will see that
[Chorus]

When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago
Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but
Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue

I went up on the mountain to see what poor Kelly done
He killed his woman and didn't even attempt to run
Up on the mountain just to see what poor Kelly done
Well, he killed his woman and he didn't even attempt to run
When I found poor Kelly, he was standing in the door
With a thirty-two twenty and a forty-four
When I found poor Kelly, he was standing in the door
With a thirty-two twenty and a hard-hitting forty-four
I asked him was he was sorry, he said, "Nobody know
Just can't stand the way she was treatin' me anymore
Just couldn't stand the way she was doin' me anymore
She's a dirty-mistreater, she won't jive me no more"
He said, "I know I loved her better than I did myself
She misused me for somebody else
She know I loved her better than I did myself
Still she tried to misuse me for somebody else"

We use to say our love will stay until the cows come home,
And then the cows came home, do you know why?
We use to say we'll love this way, till Hades freezes over,
And then it just froze over, do you know why?
We thought we had a future dancing a jig for us,
Do you suppose our little dream got too big for us
We use to say our love will stay,
Forever and a night, and now forevers gone,
Darling, do you know why? Neither do I.

Eeny meeny miney mo
Catch your troubles by the toe
If it hollers let it go
Let it fly away
Eeny meeny miney mo
It's the saying high and low
Hear it everywhere you go
Every time of day
Big Ben rings it
Vallee sings it
Whitewood swings it
Even Mr. Crosby bings it

Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you
Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you
Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?
So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too
Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend
Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again
Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then
blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and "I Got Rhythm"
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it
Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool
So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie
So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru

Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
Sung for my Ava every night
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise

I'm feeling you, you feeling me
But still we can't be together
I got a feeling
You got these same feeling
Too bad we can't feel 'em together
I sit on my bed and wonder
How it'd be if you were mine
I think of you like no other
Here's what I do every night
Write in my notebook
X's and o's
Beside your name
Only my notebook knows how I feel
My heart is on every page
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (love a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Hey hey
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (love a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Hey hey
Do you have any idea
How hard it is to act like you don't mean a thing and
This chemistry between you & me
I wanna share with everyone (OH! )
All I can do is just write down every emotion I feel
Hopefully one day you'll find out
My love for you is real(So)
Write in my notebook
X's and o's
Beside your name
Only my notebook knows how I feel
My heart is on every page
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (love a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Hey hey
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (love a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Hey hey
So many times I must have loved & lost (I've patched up every one)
So many times I've let love walk by (I've let love go by)
This time's it's going to be different (it's gonna be different this time)
Take my notebook
Read everything in my mind
So I
Write in my notebook
X's and o's
Beside your name
Only my notebook knows how I feel
My heart is on every page
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (love a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Hey hey
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (love a little like)
Oh oh oh oh (feel a little like)
Hey hey
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Hey hey [Repeats]

There are some folks
I used to know
Who used to smile
And say hello,
And spin the world
And turn the page
Entertaining
From the stage
Father time
Forever true
Loves its own
And me and you
Disappear just like the sun,
When the day is done.
The world is falling down,
hold my hand
It's a lonely sound,
hold my hand
We'll follow the breeze
And go like the wind
And look for a place
Where the willows bend
The world is falling down,
Hold my hand, hold my hand,
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Summer's gone
And winter's here
We had a lot of rain this year
The news is really very sad
The time is late,
The fruit is bad
The morning's come
And roosters crow
But people have no place to go
And disappear
Just like the sun
When the day is done

Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet cords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window looking on the mountains and the sea how lovely
This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence
Oh my love
This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence
Oh my love

I don't care where I'm going
Just as long as I'm with you
Put it there, pal. Put it there
I'll be just like your horses
And I'll stick to you like glue
Put it there, pal. Put it there
I'm glad you're fooling Pepsodent (oh, that happy snow)
Stealing all that cash
I hear your show on Thursdays (nice, huh?)
What a lot of eggs you smash
Well at least I don't depend upon
Cologne's big moustache (oh, he gave me the brush)
You're faithful and you're fair
Put it there (skin me Dad, skin me)
You've got that something in your voice
So right for selling cheese (hustle a lot of the stuff)
Put it there, pal. Put it there (put that back in the bowl)
You know, I think your jokes are great (really?)
It's just that folks are hard to please (they're just snobs, that all)
Put it there, pal. Put it there
Your face could make a fortune
Just your nose should make a lot (how do you siphon?)
I like the way you wear those gaudy-colored shirts you've got, boy
The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot
You're such a perfect square (oh-oh, is that on the paper?)
(Where? Where?)
Shall we dance
Sorry, I have my heavy underwear on
Oh, just to once around, to the adrenalin, huh
Well, OK, if I lead
My colleague, my crony, my cohort, my friend
Companions, confederates, chums to the end
Like meat and potatoes, or salt and tomatoes
Boy, what a blend
Don't put it in the paper (don't worry about me)
Don't put it on the air (I'll finish it)
Don't put it in your pipe
Put it there
Confidentially, do you like this as well as singing
Leave your name with the girl when you go out
We may get to you for some crowd noises
Be sure and call me
All right

Some days you get diamonds
Some days nickels and dimes
Some days life's a poem
Some days nothing rhymes
Some days you're a winner
Some days you lose
Some days all you're doing is paying dues
On a Wednesday I was playing in a biker bar outside Topeka
On that Friday I was playing on a blues cruise, going to Dominica
Ebbs and flows, like the tide
Some days you get diamonds
Some days nickels and dimes
Some days sparkle
Some days nothing shines
Some days you're given
Some days you choose
Some days all you're doing is paying dues
Tonight I'm sleeping in a 5-Star hotel, Wouldn't ask for more
But I remember I wound up many a night sleeping on a stranger's floor
Sometimes you walk, sometimes you ride
Some folks treat you like something under their shoe, ain't nothin' new
Others greet you like a holy prophet, now what you gonna do'
You try to take it all in stride
'Cause some days you get diamonds
Some days nickels and dimes
Some days you're out of tune
Some days it all chimes
Some days you're grinnin'
Some days you're frownin, ' the blues
Some days all you're doing is payin' dues
Some days all you're doing is payin' dues

All Harlem's in a rage
And not from blowing gazes (?)
Pop this new time Memphis
Up there
He just blew into town
He's slimming coffee brands
His trademark is the sound
That fills the air
But Harlem's mights, don't be alarmed
He doesn't mind you any harm
He's only loaded with jungle charm
No trees about
But listen to him shout:
Wooooooah!
He's the Tarzan of Harlem
(He's the Tarzan of Harlem)
Big gals and small
All answer to his call:
Wooooooah!
He's the Tarzan of Harlem
(He's the Tarzan of Harlem)
Instead of swinging from the trees
He swings around the old sublime
Romancing all those girls
With a hey and a fly fly fly (???)
He just can't miss
He kills them with a kiss
And if some night you hear him roar
And someone's knocking at your door
That's just a way to ask
for moooooooore!
He's the Tarzan of Harlem
(He's the Tarzan of Harlem)
He just can't miss
He kills them with a kiss
He's the Tarzan of Harlem

If I could get over that hump! (mmm)
Then maybe I will feel better
Maybe I won't fall!
If I could get over that hump! (mmm)
Then maybe I will
Oh Lord knows I'm
Lord knows I'm trying
Said I'm tired (of this shit)
This dope
But it make it better
But it's dragging me lower
Hey and I know it's just (oh)
Lord knows
But If I (could get over that hump!) baby
Then maybe I will feel better
Maybe I won't fall (I won't)
If I could get over that hump!
Then maybe I will
Oh I just, I just want to fly far away (far away)
Oh I'm living check to check
I'm just trying to pay my rent
And I can feel it
Coming down around me and these children
A boy, a little girl and
She so pretty
Oh feel me
We just need a little house
Come with God with a spouse, this building, building oh
My brother's sleeping on my floor
A bitch could us a little more yeaow
Then maybe I will feel better
Maybe I won't fall (If I oh)
If I could get over
Since
We are lying here
Know I want, I want, I want you boo, to know
I ain't never done dope to cause
Only a smoked a joint or two
A toke me and you, boy
I know they both been through it
Day and night, night and day
Day and night and day and night
But I can't judge nobody
'Cause what if it was you
What if it was you
Bring it back girl
What if it was you
You

I went down in the valley one day
I heard the angels singing
I heard a voice, I saw no one
I heard the angels singing
What you reckon the angels said
I heard the angels singing
Your sins is forgiven and your soul is free
I heard the angels singing
I went down in the valley one day
I heard the angels singing to me
I seen an old devil walk down my way
I heard the angels singing
What you reckon the devil said
I heard the angels singing
He said that heaven's door is closed, go home don't pray
But I heard the angels singing
I said get back sit down, get out of my way
I heard the angels singing
I don't wanna hear another word you say
Oh I heard the angels singing
Oh yes, I heard the angels singing
Just when I thought my soul was lost
I heard the angels singing
My dungeon was shook, my chains dropped off
I heard them singing
The people come running, saying what's it all about
I heard the angels singing
The holy ghost hit me, I could not help but shout
I heard the angels singing
When I went down in the valley one day
I heard the angels singing to me
I seen an old devil walk down my way
I heard the angels singing
I said get back sit down, get out of my way
I heard the angels
I don't wanna hear another word you say
Woo! I heard 'em singing
In that great getting up morning
I heard the angels singing to me
In that great getting up morning and I, whoo!
You know I heard the angels, hallelujah!

Eighteen yellow roses came today
Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet
When the boy came to the door
I didn't know what to say
But eighteen yellow roses came today
I opened up the card to see what it said
I couldn't believe my eyes
When I had read
Though you belong to another I love you anyway
Yes eighteen yellow roses came today
I never doubted your love for a minute
I always thought that you would be true
But now this box and the flowers in it
I guess there's nothin' left for me to do
But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing
And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring
'Cause eighteen yellow roses will wilt and die one day
But a father's love will never fade away
Will never fade away

Rock a bye, your baby
With a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune
From the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, mammy mine
Right on that masoned, Dixen line
And swing it from Virginia, to Tennessee
With all the love that's in ya
Weep no more, my lady
Sing that song again, for me
Sing on black Joe, just as though
You have me on your knees
A million baby kisses, I'll deliver
If you will only play that Swanee river
Rock a bye your rock a bye baby
With a Dixie melody
Oh, weep no more, my lady
Sing that song again, for me
Sing on black Joe, just as though
You have me on your knees
A million baby kisses, I'll deliver
If you will only play that Swanee river
Rock a bye your rock a bye baby
With a Dixie melody

When I wake up in the morning
After each night that we meet
There's no room for breakfast
And the hunger is for repeat
The times we spend together
Are so few and far between
It tends to make a man forget
What a woman really means
In the early afternoon
I relax and take a break
That's when my mind is on you
Far away from the hard days of work
Trying hard to make a living
So I won't get caught between
I really get the feeling of
What a woman really means
[Chorus: x3]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Don't you forget
What a woman really means
In the twilight of the evening
When the sun is going down
My love for you grows stronger
It's so good when you're around
You have so much love to offer
And the moments in between
Yes have made me realize
What a woman really means
[Chorus: x3]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Don't you forget
What a woman really means
Squeezin', touchin', lovin'
I don't want you to forget
No no, no no, no no

Ah, wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People got to come together
And I know with the strength, power and all the feeling
Wholy holy
Wholy holy
Oh Lord, come on get together, one another
Oh Lord
Wholy holy
Wholy holy
Wholy holy we believe in one another
Wholy holy we believe in Jesus
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in
In it we've got an awful lot to learn
Oh, wholy holy
Oh Lord
We can conquer hate forever, yes we can
Ah, wholy holy, Oh Lord
We can rock the world's foundation
Yes we can
Better believe it
Wholy holy together and wholy
Holler love across the nation
Oh, oh
Wholy holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oooh, ooh

Oh, If I could live April again
If only I could live April again
How happy I would be again
Oh, If I could live April again
If only I could live April again
How happy I would be again
The early morning rain, falling on my window
Makes me think of you again
I pretend that you're here with me
And tho' it seems like April again
It's not the same
It's not the same
Oh, if I could live April again
If only I could live April again
How happy I would be again
Flowers that we saved, pressed between the pages
Of the book have turned to gray
But still I close my eyes and hold them
And know that it's not April again
It seems that way
It seems that way
Oh, if I could live April again
If only I could live April again
How happy I would be again
Oh, if I could live April again
If only I could live April again

Not to worry
Never mind
Life will fix it every time
Give a balance
Fill a need
Bring a flower,
From a seed
Hold your head up,
Raise your chin
It wasn't you
Who invented sin
Shake your shoulders, do a dance
The time is come
A quarter turn
Is clearer now
The lessons learn
And time will tell,
And fires burn
Not to worry,
Fill your head
Think of other things instead
Not to worry
Skies are blue
And everything
Imagine, is you
The time is come
A quarter turn
It's clearer now
Lessons learned
And time will tell
And fires burn
Not to worry
Wear a smile
There be changes after awhile
Now to worry dreams come true
â??cause everything imagine, is you
Everything imagine is youuuuuu

Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all
It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?

I've cried so much over you and I'm drowning in my tears
Oh it's no wonder I'm going under drowning in my tears
You hurt me so in many ways and I spent so many years
Walking and thinking so now I'm a sinking drowning in my tears
I keep on crying for help but you turned your back on me
I'm over my head in misery
I guess I'll go on this way 'till all of me disappears
Live in a bubble and in my trouble drowning in my tears
(I keep on crying for help but you turned your back on me)
I'm over my head in misery
I guess I'll go on this way 'till all of me disappears
Live in a bubble and in my trouble drowning in my tears

I don't need
I don't need the sun
Don't need the moon
Now that you're here
God gave me both in you
I don't need to sleep
Only need to look at you
Then I'll be awake
Much more than any rest could do
Through you I got heaven on earth
Boy you're my paradise
The very beat of my heart
Only you can ease my mind
Whenever I feel sad and blue
I'll be happy again
If only I look at you
[Chorus:]
I've never felt so deep in love
Never been so close to God
Never felt so much joy
I've never, I've never
I've never known a love like this
Now I know something I won't miss
You, my love, my sunshine
The most important thing in my life
I don't need anybody else but you
Cause ain't nobody makes me feel the way you do
You're the sweetest thing I've ever known
Now that I'm with you
I'll never be alone
[Chorus]
[Outro:]
Never, neva, neva felt so deep in
Never, neva, neva felt so deep in
Never, neva, neva felt so deep in
Felt so deep in love

On the day I was born,
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy
waiting for ye.
'Tis a rhyme for your lips
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.
So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.

Now looka here mama let me tell you this
If you wants to get crooked I'm gonna give you my fist
You might read from Revelations back to Genesee
But if you get crooked, your southern can belongs to me
Ain't no need you bringin no jive to me
'Cause your southern can is mine
Might go uptown have me arrested and have me put in jail
Some hotshot got money come and throw my bail
Soon as I get out, hit the ground
Your southern can worth two dollar, half a pound
Ain't no need of bringing no stuff to me
'Cause your southern can is mine
You might take it from the south you might carry it up north
But understand you can't rule or either be my boss
Take it from the east, hide it in the west
When I get it mama, your can won't see no rest
Ain't no need of bringing no stuff to me
'Cause your southern can is mine
(In the morning)
Your southern can belongs to me
(I'm not dreamin')
Your southern can belongs to me
Ah ashes to ashes mama, and sin to sin
Every time I hit you you'll think I've got a dozen hands
Give you a punch through that barb-wire fence
Every time I hit you you'll say I've got no sense
Ain't no need of bringing no stuff to me
'Cause your southern can is mine
(Every bit of it)
Southern can belongs to me
Get me a brick out of my backyard
Give you the devil if you get kinda hard
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
'Cause your southern can is mine
(You hear me cryin')
Southern can belongs to me
Spank it a little bit, boy
Ah, your southern can is mine
Now if I catch ya mama down in the heart of town
Take me a bran-new brick and tear your can on down
Ain't no need you bringin no stuff to me
Because your southern can belongs to me
(I'm talkin to ya)
Your southern can belongs to me
You may be deathbed sick and mama and graveyard bound
I'll make your can moan like a hound
Ain't no need you bringin no stuff to me
Because your southern can is mine
(You hear me talkin')
Southern can belongs to me
Oh spank it like that
The way Ruthie Mae likes it
'Cause your southern can is mine
Sit there unsteady with your eyes all red
What I said get your grandma dead
Ain't no need of bringing no jive to me
'Cause your southern can is mine
You got to stop your barkin and raising the deuce
I'll grab you mama and turn every way but loose
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
'Cause your southern can belongs to me
(Every bit of it)
Southern can belongs to me
Aww, whup it boy, that's the way the people like that thing
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
'Cause your southern can is mine
(you hear me talkin)
Your southern can belongs to me
Might twiddle like a tadpole
Let it jump like a frog
Every time I hit it you'll holler
God oh God
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
'Cause your southern can is mine
(You hear me talkin')
Southern can belongs to me
Now play it a little bit, just whup it
Aww shucks. Play that thing boy
Southern can belo-ongs to me

The jingle bells are jingling
The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know
I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I've got the Christmas blues
I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list
You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues
When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joy
But friends when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys
May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear
Oh Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged tinsel covered Christmas blues
Oh Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged tinsel covered Christmas blues

Oh, freedom, oh, freedom
Oh, freedom over me
And before I'd be a slave
I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord and be free
No more weepin', no more weepin'
No more weepin' over me
And before I'd be a slave
I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord and be free
No more worry, no more worry
No more worry over me
And before I'd be a slave
I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord and be free
Oh, freedom, oh, freedom
Oh, freedom over me
And before I'd be a slave
I'd be buried in my grave
And go home to my Lord and be free

CHORUS
I can love again
More than a sentimental feeling I hold within
With a heart full of compassion You took me in
You're my closest friend, I can love again
A smile would hide my pain
I'd have to laugh to keep from shedding a tear
The sting of a promise broken, a needy word unspoken
Helped turn my pain to fear
But there You were for me
Helped to ease the pain that caused me agony
Can't help but to wonder
Why You pulled me from under
But it feels so good within, I can love again
CHORUS
No one could see
What my foolish pride had done to me
Caused me to ignore
All the love that was in store
That was in store for me
It's because of You
Pride has passed away
Your love revealed what was true
All the love within
Caused this broken heart to mend
Your love I want to commend
Everybody, I can love again
CHORUS * CHORUS * BRIDGE
Life is worth living again
Since You gave me joy and peace
down within
So good to know I'm loved for sure
Fear no longer lives within, I can love again
CHORUS * REPEAT

I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm
How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere

You call me up but you know it's late
I keep hoping for a regular date
I'm out of control it's a personal crime
Ahh and now I'm runnin to you one more time
I know your evil well I'm under your spell
Hunt down you, is like a season in Hell
I got a problem well it looks like you
I find I worship everything that you do
You got me jumpin baby out of my skin
Oooh, what kind of love should feel like a sin
Now I can't take one more thing
I just want to get, loose tonight
DGA repeatYou're the wrong man for me
You're the wrong man for me
You're the wrong man for me
You're the wrong man for me
BRIDGE
Mornin after making love your up and gone
Ahh, you got me thinking that I done it wrong
Drive me crazy turn me into your fool
Oooh how can you be so Goddam kewl
Well loving you is a bad sensation
Drive me to the bottle wanna take a vacation
Gotta find a way to shake these blues
I'll try to live my life after losing you
A love so tight why'd we let it go
Ooh sometimes baby I just don't know
I can't take one more thing
I just want to get, loose tonight Chorus:

Blues on the loveseat
Where we used to kiss
I'm alone in my living room
And my man is sorely missed
I got the blues all over
Blues won't let me be
I got the blues all over
Blues all over me
Blues on the table
At his empty seat
I was feeling mighty hungry
But the blues won't let me eat
I got the blues all over
Blues won't let me be
I got the blues all over
Blues all over me
Blues when I'm happy
Blues when I am sad
Blues my only comfort
When he makes me mad
Blues where I'm going
I can't get rid of all my blues
And now I've quit from trying
Blues in the cupboard
On the shelf by the gin
I'm drinking by myself
Because he did not come home again
I got the blues all over
Blues won't let me be
I got the blues all over
Blues all over me
Blues in the bedroom
In the middle of the night
He's passed out here beside me
So he cannot hold me tight
I got the blues all over
Blues won't let me be
I got the blues all over
Blues all over me

Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight
You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along
If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so
You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

You only live twice or so it seems
One life for yourself and one for your dreams
You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is it's name
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters
Nosey pokes'll peek thru their shutters
And their eyes will pop
The wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown
The dashboard's genuine leather
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down
In case there's a change in the weather
Two bright sidelights winkin' and blinkin'
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin'
'At I'd care to swap
For that shiny little surrey
With the fringe on the top
Did you say the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Has it really got a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
So y' c'n tell them apart
All the world 'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell for leather
Cats and dogs 'll dance in the heather
Birds and frogs 'll sing altogether
And the toads 'll hop
The wind 'll whistle as we rattle along
The cow 'll moo in the clover
The river 'll ripple out a whispered song
And whisper it over and over
Don't you wisht it'd go on forever
Don't you wisht it'd go on forever
Don't you wisht it'd go on forever
And it'd never stop
In that shiny little surrey
With the fringe on top
I can see the stars gettin' blurry
As we ride back home in the surrey
Riding slowly home in the surrey
With the fringe on top
I can feel the day gettin' older
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder
'Til it falls ker-plop
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill
The moon is takin' a header
And just as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still
A lark 'll wake up in the meader
Hush you bird my baby is sleepin'
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'
Whoa you team, just keep a creepin'
At a slow clip-clop
Don't you hurry with the surrey
With the fringe on the top

We've been together for so long
Listen baby, I'm gonna love you
Right or wrong
don't fence me out
Cause I love you so
And I never want to let you go
But you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
You keep trying, trying, trying
Trying, trying, trying
Our love was done before it starts
Listen baby, you think that you are having fun
Somehow I know, you hurt me so
Sooner or later gonna let me go
And you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
And you keep trying, trying, trying
Trying, trying, trying
Somehow I know, you hurt me so
Sooner or later gonna let me go
And you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me

Who's gonna kiss me
Who's gonna thrill me
Who's gonna hold me tight
Tonight
Why did I tell you I was going to Shanghai
I wannna be with you tonight
Why did I holler I was going to Shanghai
I wanna be with you tonight
It was just a little misunderstanding
That a kiss on the cheek could patch
I need you so badly, I'd gladly
Start all over from scratch
Oh, why did I tell you it was bye bye for Shanghai
I'm even allergic to rice
Why don't you stop me when I talk about Shanghai
It's just a lover's device
Now, who's gonna kiss me
Who's gonna thrill me
Who's gonna hold me tight
I'm right around the corner in the phone booth
And I wannna be with you tonight
Now, why did I tell you it was bye bye for Shanghai
I'm even allergic to rice
Why don't you stop me when I talk about Shanghai
It's just a lover's device
Now, who's gonna kiss me
Who's gonna thrill me
Who's gonna hold me tight
I'm right around the corner in the phone booth
And I wannna be with you tonight

When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend

I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And "I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!"
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming

Uncle Ray is gone, a relative they couldn't find
Finally free of his insanity, they covered him with lime
In a ditch outside the old junkyard on 17
Well that crazy drunk I swear he was a gentleman to me
So take him far far away
Take him far far away
Out past all discussions, far from what they said
Take him far far away
Take him far far away
'cause we're sort of related
Here lies Uncle Ray
Dry rough skin, his hands, a working man, like bark from trees
He'd come to the back door of my family's house
For coffee and something to eat
Pushed a shopping cart all filled with junk and empty cans
He came home from the war to find his wife
Now loved another man
So take him far far away
Take him far far away
Out past all discussions, far from what they said
Take him far far away
Take him far far away
'cause we're sort of related
Here lies Uncle Ray
In this photograph we're hand in hand in deep white snow
Ray was 65 and nearly blind, and I was 4 or so
All the neighbors used to laugh and throw snowballs at him
Now I live alone and when it snows
I try not to think of them
So take him far far away
Take him far far away
Out past all discussions, far from what they said
Take him far far away
Take him far far away
'cause we're sort of related
'cause we're sort of related
'cause we're sort of related
Here lies Uncle Ray
Here lies Uncle Ray...

Jump with my baby
I wanna jump with my baby
And I don't mean maybe tonight
I wanna jump with my baby
And I don't mean maybe tonight
I wanna jump all night
lt's gonna be all right with her
I wanna swing with my baby
And I don't mean maybe tonight
I wanna swing with my baby
And I don't mean maybe tonight
I'm gonna swing all night
lt's gonna be all right with her
I'm gonna jump with my baby tonight
I'm gonna jump with my baby tonight
I'm gonna jump all night
lt's gonna be alright with her

Here comes the man with the mandolin
He'll cheer you up 'till your ship comes in
Lovable old fellow playing an old tune
He comes 'round every afternoon
Raggedy old minstrel, wearing a big grin
You'll love the man with the mandolin
All the kids foller, all the kids holler
To the windows above
Mamma throw a nickle and the man will tick
A little tune we love
Open your heart let the music in
There goes the man with the mandolin

I got no diamond though I'm shy
Still I think I'm a lucky guy
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion got no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the milky way
Got no checkbook got no bank
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening
I'm all right
I got no diamonds? though I'm shy
Still I think I'm a lucky guy
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion go no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the milky way
Got no checkbook got no bank
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening
I'm all right

You don't laugh anymore, when we're alone
You don't talk quite as long, when we're on the phone
You say that you, still love me so, but I can read between the lines
You don't hear half the things, that I say to you
You don't hold me as close, as you used to do
You say that you, won't let me go, but I can read between the lines
Your love for me is over, it isn't hard to tell
In every single thing you do, you say it all too well
And the glow in your eyes, is there no more
When you speak of the plans, that you have in store
It's time my dear, that I let you know that I can read between the lines

Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered "Be true to me"
And she sighed: "Si, Si"
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered "Be true to me"
And she sighed: "Si, Si"
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Takes two to tango two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango do the tango do the dance of love
You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
There are lots of things that you can do alone
But takes two to tango two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango do the tango do the dance of love
You can croon to the moon by yourself
Well you can laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot go to pot on your own
There are a lot of things that you can do alone
But takes two to tango two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango do the tango do the dance of love
Takes two takes two
Darling it always takes two
To tango

Though, I'm left without a penny
The wolf was discreet
He left me my feet
And so, I put them down on anything
But the la belle
La perfectly swell romance
Never gonna dance
Never gonna dance
Only gonna love
Never gonna dance
Have I a heart that acts like a heart
Or is it a crazy drum
Beating the weird tattoos
Of the St. Louis Blues?
Have I two eyes to see your two eyes
Or see myself on my toes
Dancing to radios
Or Major Edward Bowes?
Though, I'm left without a penny
The wolf was discreet
He left me my feet
And so, I put them down on anything
But the la belle
La perfectly swell romance
Never gonna dance
Never gonna dance
Only gonna love
Never gonna dance
I'll put my shoes on beautiful trees
I'll give my rhythm back to the breeze
My dinner clothes may dine where they please
For all I really want is you
And to Groucho Marx, I give my cravat
To Harpo goes my shiny silk hat
And to heaven, I give a vow
To adore you, I'm starting now
To be much more positive that
Though, I'm left without my penny
The wolf was not smart
He left me my heart
And so, I cannot go for anything
But the la belle
La perfectly swell romance
Never gonna dance
Never gonna dance
Only gonna love you
Never gonna dance

I got a guy
He don't dress me in sable
He looks nothing like Gable
But he's mine
And I think he's too divine
I got a guy
When he starts into pet me
He's the sauce on spaghetti
He's the kind
That you can't keep off your mind
I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up, I swear
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire
I'm riding high
'Cause I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing that can scare me
'Cause I got a guy
I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up, I swear
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire
I'm riding high
'Cause I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing that can scare me
'Cause I got a guy

There's a song that's really jumping
And the fellas say it's Squatty Roo
And it's really dumping
La-de-doo

Here's a little tune we're gonna play for you
There ain't nothin' to it and it's easy to do
Called the Calloway Boogie, the Calloway Boogie
It keeps you groovy twenty four hours a day
If you like music with a boogie beat
Here's a little ditty that's really all reet
It's the Calloway Boogie, the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovin' twenty four hours a day
I woke up with the blues the other day
The cats started swingin', then they blew 'em away
With the Calloway Boogie, the Calloway Boogie
It keeps you groovy twenty four hours a day
We play waltzes, bebop and jive
It's the kind of music gonna keep you alive
It's the Calloway Boogie, the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovin' twenty four hours a day, yeah

Steady, steady.
You know when you're ready.
It's a long road walking into the sun.
The heat can make you lose your head,
Your sense of direction.
Steady, steady
I am ready
To be the one.
I can take "for better," but "for worse" I can't condone
Most of all "for good" just makes me ache to be alone
Oh, oh
How long is forever?
I'm swimming in this dress, a child in her mother's clothes
This ring around my finger's like a chain around my throat.
Are you so sure you've tamed me?
Steady, steady
Know when you're ready
It's a long road walking into the sun
The heat can make you lose your head
Your sense of direction,
Oh, steady, steady
I am ready
To run.
We talked about the west, 'bout packing up our lives and hopes.
Ain't it a shame with time, our dreams turn into jokes?
Oh, oh
I won't let that be us.
Nostalgic for the good times, like our dreams walked out on us
Like we woke up in an empty bed, here and now and stuck.
Oh, oh
I'll chase them down alone.
Don't just watch me go, you fool.
Run with me,
Keep up, keep up,
Keep up.
It's not you I'm leaving,
Are you listening?
I just can't take the rut, the rut.
I won't say "I do,"
Until you promise me
That though we gray,
We can stay young and wild and free,
Young and wild and free,
And if you can't,
Don't blame me
If you can't,
Don't blame me
If you can't
Don't blame me
Steady, steady
Know when you're ready
It's a long road walking into the sun
The heat can make you lose your head
Your sense of direction
Oh, steady, steady
We weren't ready

Sleep warm sleep tight
When you turn off the light
Sleep tight sleep warm
My love
Rest your head on the pillow
What a lucky pillow
Close to you so close to you
All night
Sleep warm sleep well
Let dreams weave you a spell
Sweet dreams of me
My love
Close your eyes now and kiss me
And whisper you'll miss me
Sleep tight
Sleep well
Sleep warm

People are we givin' love
Love all the time
People are we givin' love
We need to survive
I wonder why we seldom try
To tell the truth but we welcome lies
Every sister and brother knows
What is wrong and what is right
Everyone under the sun
Must live in this big world
Hand in hand we'll save the land
For all our boys and girls
People are we givin' love
Love all the time
People are we givin' love
We need to survive
Tell me how do you feel inside
Do you let love come alive
See just how happy we could be
Livin' peacefully in harmony
Everyone under the sun
Must live in this big world
Hand in hand we'll save the land
For all our boys and girls
People are we givin' love
Love all the time
People are we givin' love
We need to survive
People are we
We givin' love
People are we
We gettin' love
People are we
We givin' love
People are we
We gettin' love

A
Voice
in the
Wind
Voices in the wind
the wind
the wind
I cried, screamed and hollerd out
Sickly I got more ill
I could not sleep another day
Without knowing
What would become of him.
The just of the wind,
Swaying from silence...
Is the wind calling my name?
I swept the tears of anger and loss
With a hidden mask of hope
Deep inside I wanted more
Than a smerk of being ignored
By the one I cared for.
A response is what I ask of me
I am not afraid of the storm.
Whistling in kind words
Gestures gentle and soft
The notes of a jazz tune
Wondering schemes of suicide
But, I am not afraid.
I could not bear or face the truth
Unaware of what lies ahead
I could only swear to my one God
For trust and hope to come
My mind wonders
Thoughts invincible to open space
Day dreaming of my one true friend.
The friend I have is my faith in God
My shield of strength
To carry on
And, I am not afraid.
I once loved the quietness
Nothing, no-one, no-thing
The joy lonelyness brings...
But to empty hearts
And selfishness
Holds back timeless emotions of love
In broken hearts that tears lost souls
Into dry bitter leaves of winter
I stand proud, I too survived
That deadly wind of death.
If only someone listened -
A
Voice
in the Wind
the wind
wind

I been to pass your doorway
Gave you a buzz, that's all
Lately I thought all about you
So I thought I'd pay a social call
Do you recall the old days
We use to have a ball
Not that I'm lonesome without you
I thought I'd just pay a social call
I lie and say things are just swell
But to tell the truth
I haven't been too well
And if you should try to kiss me
I wouldn't even stall
Maybe we'll get back together
Starting with incendental, elemental
Simple social call
Yeah
Being here with you again
Has brought such precious memories
Awaking many feelings
I feel so alive again
Sitting here talking to you
Late into the night
Feels like we've never ever been apart
You've always been in my heart
I vividly remember things we used to do and say
And laugh and dance and ooh
You were my boo
How we ever parted
I guess life just ends up being
Then we went our separate ways
Singing has been so amazing
So many wonderful things
I've worked for, prayed for
Have filled my days
But while this fabulous life is taking place
That one special love has not filled sacred space
Now I feel the heat, the fire, the sweetness
As you hold me in your arms
There's no way I want to go
But baby, take it slow
Let's do some laughing, dancing
Dreaming and romancing
Ooo let's give it a go
I lie and say things are just swell
But to tell the truth
I haven't been too well
And if you should try to kiss me
Oooh I wouldn't even stall
Maybe we'll get back together
Starting with incendental, elemental
Simple social call
Starting with incendental, elemental
Simple social call

Highest high, deep inside
That lifts you up and sets you free, nothin' else can
Highest high, deep inside
That takes you there and brings you back again
Bid dreams never sleep
I made a promise to myself, I've got to keep
I was down for somethin'
Somethin' soul, for real
Alway's lookin' outside for the one thing I could feel
But when my faith was under fire
I never turned 'round, and never once backed down
>From my desire, my heart and soul still had control and I knew (I)
I had the highest high, that power deep inside
That lifts you up and sets you free, like nothin' else can
I got the highest high, love is the highest high
That takes you there and brings you back again
Ever since that day
I know I'll never feel alone or be afraid
I was on a mission, on a search within
Tryin' to find the reason for the trouble that I've been
'Cause when my faith was under fire
I never turned 'round, and never once backed down
>From my desires, my heart and soul still had control and I knew (I)
I had the highest high, that power deep inside
That lifts you up and sets you free, like nothin' else can
I got the highest high, love is the highest high
That takes you there and brings you back again
I got the highest high, that power deep inside
That lifts you up and sets you free, like nothin' else can
I got the highest high, love is the highest high
That takes you there and brings you back again
I'm high, I'm so high
My feet don't touch the ground, my head's up in the clouds
I'm high, I'm so high
My feet don't touch the ground, my head's up in the clouds
I was down for somethin'
Somethin' soul, for real
Alway's lookin' outside for the one thing I could feel
And when my faith was under fire
I never turned 'round, I never once backed down
(I) The highest high, deep inside
That lifts you up and sets you free, like nothin' else can
The highest high, deep inside
That takes you there and brings you back again

Little fly,
Thy summer's play
My thoughtless hand
Has brushed away
Am not I
A fly like thee?
Or art not thou
A man like me?
Oh, oh, oh
Little fly
For I dance
And drink, and sing,
Till some blind hand
Shall brush my wing
If thought is life
And strength and breath
And the want
Of thought is death
Oh, oh, oh
Little fly
Then am I
A happy fly
If I live,
Or if I die

Hallelujah, when I lay my burden down
Oh glory, glo', hallelu', when I lay my burden down
I'm goin' home to, oh, when I lay my burden
Oh, I'm goin' home
Live with Jesus, when I lay my burden down
All my troubles will be
Oh, when I lay my
Mmm, my troubles, when I lay my burden down
I'm gonna meet my lovin' mother, when I lay my burden down
I'm gonna meet my, when I lay my burden down
Glory, glory, mmm, when I lay my burden down
Glory, glory, when I lay my burden down

Ol' macdonald had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
And on this farm there was a chick purtiest chick
I know with a little curve here
And a little curve there this chick,
She had curves everywhere
Ol' macdonald had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
And oh, this chick, she had a walk ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
And how this walk would drive em wild swingin' to
And fro with a little wiggle here
And a little wiggle there man,
This chick had moves to spare
Ol' macdonald had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
When she went walking into town ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
The local gentry popped their eyes tarnation!
What a show!
With a gol-dang here
And a gosh darn there
Heavens to betsy, I do declare!
Ol' macdonald had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
There was a barn dance saturday night ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
And fellas came from miles around just to see her do-si-do
With a promenade here, and a promenade there at a square-dance,
Man, this chick's no square
Ol' macdonald had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
I used to be a travelin' man eeeee-eyeee--oh
Until I hit macdonald's place
Things were mighty slow with a little chick here
And a little chick there
I didn't have a real chick anywhere
Ol' macdonald had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
This farmer's daughter knocked me out ee-eye-ee-eye-oh
I asked macdonald for her hand
And he hollered go with a little curve here
And a little wiggle there a gol-dang here
And a gosh darn there a do-si-do here
And a promenade there

That's right, macdonald! it's all or nothin', baby!

These are the words I say when I want you near to me

If you wander far away Zambia or Monterey
I'll be there the one to wash your tears away ay - ay - ay

From the island of Manhattan to the coast of gold
From north to south, from east to west
You are the love, I love the best
You're the dreamboat in the sweetest story ever told
A dream I sought, both night and day
For years through all, the U.S.A.
The star I hitched my wagon to
Is very obviously you
Of thee I sing, baby
Summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby.
You're my silver lining,
You're my sky of blue
There's a lovelight shining
Just because of you.
Of thee I sing, baby,
You have got that certain thing, baby
Shining star and inspiration
Worthy of a mighty nation,
Of thee I sing.

Life upon the wicked stage ain't ever what a girl supposes
Stage door Johny's outraging over you with gems and roses
When you let a-fella hold your hand which means an extra beer or sandwich
Everybody whispers, ?Ain't her life a world?
Though you're warned against the rule, way ruining your reputation
When you played around the one night trade around the great big nation
Wild old man who give you jewels and sables only live in Aesop's fables
Life upon the wicked stage is nothin' for a girl
I admit it's fun to smear my face with paint
Causing everyone to think I'm what I ain't
And I'd like to play a Demi Monday roll with soul
Ask the hero, does he liked the way I lure
When I play a Hasie or a Parramore
Yet when once the gut feels down my life is pure and how I dread it

I want a full-time job makin' love to you
I'll do anything you want me to
But if you have no plan to use a full-time man
A part-time job will do
I want a full-time job bein' close to you
Makin' all your dreams come true
But if your heart don't throb about a full-time job
A part-time job will do
You wouldn't, you wouldn't have to pay me
A nickel or a dime
As long as you would let me (DORIS: Do what?)
Give myself a little bit of crazy overtime
I want a full-time job holdin' hands with you
I think you'd kinda like it too
Don't want a part-time job, I want a full-time job
But a part-time job will do
I want a full-time job makin' love to you
I'll do anything you want me to
But if you have no plan to use a full-time man
A part-time job will do
I want a full-time job bein' close to you
Makin' all your dreams come true
But if your heart don't throb about a full-time job
A part-time job will do
You wouldn't, you wouldn't have to pay me
A nickel or a dime
But baby, if you'd let me, then I know you won't forget me
And it isn't any crime to have a gratis overtime
I want a full-time job holdin' hands with you
I think you'd kinda like it too
Don't need a part-time job, I want a full-time job
But a part-time job will do
There wouldn't be no point in livin'
And I know we'll be forgivin'
It's a full-time job with you

(Intro)
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It's all about the funk
Wuh-uh, ah-ah
(Verse 1)
How many times did I try to tell you, you know
You ain't gonna get sympathy
You can't always chase your own desires
Or you'll be chasing endlessly
Decide, see what's to decide in your mind
Why you got to mess around and let her down?
How ja think she'd feel about it
She'd feel about what you do
How ja think she'd feel about it
Oh-oh
(Chorus 1)
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
Ho-ho, ho-wuh-oh
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
Ho-ho
(Verse 2)
I know about the rhymes that you been spinning
You know in time it comes back on you
This ain't a story you'll be winning
But there are two ways you can lose
Decide, see what's to decide in your mind
Why you got to mess around and let her down?
How ja think she'd feel about it
She'd feel about what you do
How ja think she'd feel about it
She'd feel about what you do
Oh-oh
(Chorus 2)
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
Ho-ho, ho-wuh-oh
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
(Bridge)
Ohhhh
Uh-uh, oh-oh
Yeah-eah
Da-da, da-da,
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh,
Your playing's over, I Been on to you
So you'd better oh-oh
You better give it up
Think you're clever ? Now you're down a peg or two
Take it down, take it down,
Take it down, take it down
(Chorus 3)
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about, she'd feel about
She'd feel about it
(Coda)
Those things that you promise that you'd never do
If she knew all the things that you put her through
How would she feel, if she knew 'bout what you've done?
Found out the person that you've now become
You'll see that every dog will have his day
That's the time that you learn there's a price to pay
That you hurt all the people you betray
If she knew, if she knew
But you knew and you went and did it anyway
Those things that you promise that you'd never do
How ja think she'd feel about it
If she knew all the things that you put her through
How ja think she'd feel about it
How would she feel, if she knew 'bout what you've done ?
How ja think she'd feel about it
Found out the person that you've now become
You'll see that every dog will have his day
That's the time that you learn there's a price to pay
That you hurt all the people you betray
But you knew and you went and did it anyway

What's the matter Jesus? Did you forget my name?
I'm the one with the tumor like a flower in my brain
And I have learned to rue the day that I
Slid from my utopia of amniotic slime
God is a spider
God is a spider
God is a spider
Tryin' to block my path
And it's a matter of fate, and it's a matter of love into hate
Mistakes - I want to make my final escape
My final escape
Mayday Mayday Mayday Mayday
I was born a Taurus, and not a toreador
I can't join your chorus, I'm getting way too bored
And I don't want to die, I'm gonna plug my ears
Why am I disgusted by the things I overhear?
God is a spider
God is a spider
God is a spider
Tryin' to block my path
Crows in the cornfield, reaper swings the scythe
I know a venomous bird about to fly
Smear the paint 'til the colors run
It's nearly time, I'm nearly done
Flaming orange open sky
And it's a matter of fate, and it's a matter of love into hate
Mistakes - I want to make my final escape
My final escape
Mayday Mayday Mayday Mayday

Well, I passed the wishing well and I threw my penny in
Sent a prayer on up above that you would come my way again
Yeah, I've seen some better days and in each on you were there
Running circles through the graveyard throwing daisies in the air
Oh, oh, Valentino
Oh, oh, my tears don't show
But oh honey they flow
Well, I crossed the lakes and mountains, ended up in Hollywood
Playing piano in that pink hotel just like you said I would
I kept looking out my window hoping one day you would come
Going every shade of blue under that California sun
Oh, oh, Valentino
Oh, oh, my tears don't show
But oh honey they flow
So much for the promises
So much for them daisy chains
Oh, why carry all those heavy dreams
When the only one I really want is you
Oh, oh, Valentino
Oh, oh, my tears don't show
But oh honey they flow
Oh, oh, Valentino
Oh, oh, my tears don't' show
But oh honey they flow
Oh, honey they flow, flow, flow

Ever feel kinda of down and out and don't know just what to do?
Livin' all of days in darkness, let the sun shine through
Ever fell that somehow, somewhere you lost your way?
And if you don't get help you won't make it through the day
You could call on Lady Day!
You could call on John Coltrane!
They'll wash your troubles, your troubles away
Plastic people with plastic minds on their way to plastic homes
There's no beginning, there ain't no ending
Just on and on and on and on and
It's all because we're so afraid to say that we're alone
Until our hero rides in, rides in on his saxophone
You could call on Lady Day!
You could call on John Coltrane!
They'll wash your troubles, your troubles away

I been in the right place but it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing but I must have used the wrong line
I been in the right trip but I must have used the wrong car
My head was in a bad place and I'm wondering what it's good for
I been in the right place but it must have been the wrong time
My head was in a bad place but I'm having such a good time
I been running trying to get hung up in my mind
Got to give myself a good talking-to this time
Just need a little brain salad surgery
Got to cure my insecurity
I been in the wrong place but it must have been the right time
I been in the right place but it must have been the wrong song
I been in the right vein but it seems like the wrong arm
I been in the right world but it seems wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
Slipping dodging sneaking creeping hiding out down the street
See me life shaking with every ho' I meet
Refried confusion is making itself clear
Wonder which way do I go to get on out of here

When the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the day you promised to come back to me
When you whispered, "Farewell" in Capistrano
T'was the day the swallows flew out to the sea
All the mission bells will ring
The chapel choir will sing
The happiness you'll bring
Will live in my memory
When the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the day I pray that you'll come back to me!

Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
Je ne sais pas what you do
You know you've completely
Stolen my heart
Morning, noon and nighttime too
Toujours, wondering what to do
That's the way I've felt
Right from the start
Ah, Cherie
My love for you is tres, tres fort
Wish my French were good enough
I'd tell you so much more
But I hope that you compree
All the things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
I love you, yes I do
Wish my French were good enough
I'd tell you so much more
But I hope that you compree
All the things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup
I love you, yes I do

Yeah...
We Can Go...
I'll Show You
If you really really really want to know let me know...
We Can go
If you really really really want to know we can go...

There was a little Spanish flea
A record star he thought he'd be
He heard of singers like Beatles
And The Chipmunks he'd seen on TV
Why not a little Spanish flea?
And so he hid
Inside a doggie from Madrid
He arrived in the city
Still singin his sweet harmony
As proud as any flea could be
He walked around
As if he owned the town
Humming his pint sized melody
With his guitar he knew he'd be a star
And in his own home town, how proud he'd be
Then all at once he met a man
Who said, "I'll help you if I can"
He listened close to his song
And then he sang right along for you see
He loved that little Spanish flea

I went down to the river, sat beneath the willow tree
The dew dropped on those willow leaves and it rolled right down on me
And that's the reason I've got those weeping willow blues
I went up on the mountain, high as any girl could stand
And looked down on the mean town that took away my lovin' man
And that's the reason I've got those weepin' willow blues
I heard the whistle blowing, the fireman ring the bell
They're taking away that willow tree that give me this weeping spell
And that's the reason I've got those weeping willow blues
When you're broken hearted and your man is out of town
Go to the river, take the chains and sit down
And if he don't come back to you, I'll tell you what to do
Just jump right overboard, 'cause he ain't no more to you

Bernadette, people are searchin' for the kind of love that we possess
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds
They pretend to be my friend
When all the time they long to persuade you from my side
They'd give the world and all they own for just one moment we have known
Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live
But while I live only to hold you some other men
They long to control you
But how can they control you Bernadette
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette
From wanting you, needing you
But darling, you belong to me
I'll tell the world you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me
I'll tell the world you're a part of me
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind the world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine has always been longing for
In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
For the only joy in life is to be loved
So whatever you do
Bernadette, keep on loving me, Bernadette, keep on needing me Bernadette
You're the soul of me
On that dream, you're a ? to me
And Bernadette, you mean more to me
Than a woman was ever meant to be

Here goes - baby here goes
Every worry, every fear goes
Every dull day in the year goes
I'm about to fall in love
Here goes - yes sir, here goes
Every sky that isn't clear goes
Every sigh that's insincere goes
'Cause it's you I'm dreamin' of
Looks like I've been sold out
Can't fight off the charms
I just couldn't hold out
It's cold out of your arms
Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above
Here goes - baby here goes
Someone ready for love
Here goes - brush that grin off
Brush that endless - bobby pin off
And the biscuits - that chagrin off
I'm about to fall in love
Here goes - get the fights out
And the quarrel - over nights out
And the patch up - when the lights out
That is all I'm dreaming of
Looks like I've been taken
Shaken off the tree
Looks like you'll be makin'
The bacon just for me
Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above
Here goes - here goes
Here goes someone - someone who's really in love

Down with love the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that moon wrap it in cellophane
Down with love let's liquidate all its friends
Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love yes take it away, away
Away
Far away
Give it back to the birds and bees and the Viennese
Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Down with sighs and down with cupid
Brother let's stuff that dove
Down with love
Down with love let's liquidate all its friends
The moons the Junes the roses and rainbow's ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love yes take it away, away
Far away
So very, very far away
Give it back to the birds and the bees and especially the Viennese
Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Down with sighs and down with cupid
Brother let's stuff that dove
Down with love

I hate myself
We'll have that in common
Although I've gotten most everything I wanted
Hope is still a flicker in the dark
Somewhere in the distance, a mysterious spark
If we never meet
That would be the saddest thing I know.
There's got to be somebody out there
Someone who burns like a flame
It's a beautiful night by the fountain
But I'm all alone
I don't know your name
[Dewey solos]
This is to you, if you're out there
My love, you seem to be detained
I don't deserve you, but it's too cruel
That you're not here with me
Flickering... the saddest thing...
I know

Babe, I'm on my last go round and I hate to say goodbye
Babe, I'm on my last go round but it's time to say goodbye
Since you did what you wanna do, babe, and I guess you satisfied
Since you've got me grievin', babe, and I'm scared to say goodbye
You got me grievin', baby, and I'm scared to say goodbye
Well, I've got to leave you, baby, and it ain't no use to crying
You started me to drinkin', baby, drinkin' both night and day
And you started me to drinkin', baby, and runnin' from town to town
You know I had a good woman but you made her throw me down
Yeah, yeah, you make me drunk on Sunday just to play me for your clown
Baby, you make me drunk on Sunday just to play me for your clown
Babe, you know I meant you all the good but you tried to tear me down

Now it was a hot sticky morning
'Round the Fourth of July
The breeze was standing still
I'm hanging out by myself
And I'm having a good time
With the folk inside my head
And you know, Lord,
How you did a lovely thing
See, times my head is lighter
Than it's ever been
And anyone who's ever had
Sweet potato pie
Don't want pumpkin again,
No, they don't want
'Cause it don't taste right, no
Look-a-here city boy with your
Silks and braided hair
Don't you let nobody fool you
With no imitation nothing
Tell 'em, say, unh, unh, buddy,
I been there
Listen mama, when you
Finally walk on in
Don't forget to bring along
Your sweet potato tin
'Cause when you serve him
A slice of your sweet potato
Sin, girl, he won't want pumpkin again,
No, he won't want
Now I took a trip down to Sissy's
She's a friend of mine
She smiled and asked me in
Well, she drew a box and a big,
Fancy question mark
Said, "Brother, which one is you in?"
I told her, "Sister, don't worry
'bout the mule going blind
You just sit in the wagon and
Hold on to the line
'Cause anyone who's ever had
Sweet potato pie
Don't want pumpkin again,
Really don't want"
Now I saw the gates
Gold and pearl
And I sat right down
In a dream of you, old friend
I'm thinking some milk and
Honey and a pot of stew
Might fill that gap again
You know, I'm a thankful
Witness to the things I've seen
And times my head is lighter
Than it's ever been
And anyone who's ever had
Sweet potato pie
Really don't want pumpkin again,
No they won't want
Would you give me some
Sweet potato y'all

No cares for me
I'm happy as I can be
I learn to love and to live
Devil may care
No cares and woes
Whatever comes later goes
That's how I'll take and I'll give
Devil may care
When the day is through, I suffer no regrets
I know that he who frets, loses the night
For only a fool, thinks he can hold back the dawn
He was wise to never tries to revise what's past and gone
Live love today, love come tomorrow or May
Don't even stop for a sigh, it doesn't help if you cry
That's how I live and I'll die
Devil may care

from what I see, we're already dead
and you do believe it friend
you do believe it friend
- from the moment you despise reality
you only have the right to shut your mouth
close your eyes, turn back, dig a hole and all
turn back, turn back, turn back... -
you've drawed yourself being already dead
youre overwhelmed by money
you've drawed ourselves being already dead
and starving,starving
no matter how much you can pray...
- from the moment you despise reality
you only have the right to shut your mouth
close your eyes, turn back, dig a hole and all
turn back, turn back, turn back... -
now i'm here with you
(not inside your head)
from what I see, we're already dead
and you do believe it friend

Ohh yeah, ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I headed to club, straight to the VIP

So I make my way to the door

Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
She all up on my head like don't leave

The situations got me blinded
'Cause I gotta girl at home, ohh
Now she all on my ear with it
Damn the way, she drop it down low

Body really outta control, damn

But she got me open like a door

You're the future, and you've come for what is yours
The hidden treasure, locked behind the hidden doors
And the promise of a day that's shiny new
Only a dreamer, could afford this point of view
But you're a driver, not a passenger in life
And if you're ready, you won't have to try 'cause
You are the Universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, yes I do
You're a winner, so do what you came here for
The secret weapon, isn't secret anymore
You're a driver, never passenger in life
And when you're ready, you won't have to try 'cause
You are the Universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, yes I do
You are the Universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't be
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, and I believe in me
(Yes I do
Believe in you
I do)
You're a driver, not a passenger in life
And when you're ready, you won't have to try 'cause
You are the Universe.

The stars are gonna twinkle and shine
This evening about a quarter to nine
My loving arms are gonna tenderly twine twee twee twine
Around you around a quarter to nine
I know I won't be late 'cause at half past eight
I'm gonna hurry there
I'll be waiting where the lane begins
Waiting for you on needles and pins
And then the world is gonna be mine oh all mine
This evening about a quarter to nine
Then the world is gonna be mine
This evening about a quarter to nine

Listen to my tale of woe
It's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you, so
Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady be good
Oh lady be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady be good, to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just
A lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just
A lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me
Oh, lady be good to me

Oh
Goin' through a thing now
Fittin' to pull his thing out
What a day, day
Goin' through a thing now
Fittin' to pull his thing out

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

Looking in your eyes
Is like looking through a window
Seeing clear skies of days gone by
Of happiness, imagining sweet visions
Of your loveliness
Oh and your tenderness
Makes me want to cry,
For the love that we've shared
It makes me feel alive to know that you care
Hold you through the night,
Let me lie in your arms
Tonight I want to love you, girl
'Til the morning comes and look into your eyes
Your sweet and smiling eyes
Take me to paradise
It makes me want to cry tears of joy
Whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes
When I see your face, oh and
You hold me in your warm embrace
I feel so safe
Your amazing grace calms me through the fire
Or the rainy days and the clouds it brings
Makes me want to cry,
For the love that we've shared
It makes me feel alive to know that you care
Hold you through the night
Let me lie in your arms
Tonight I want to love you, girl
'Til the morning comes
And look into your eyes
Your sweet and smiling eyes,
Hold me, darling
Take me to paradise
Your an angel, it makes me want to cry
Tears of joy whenever I see
Your sweet and smiling eyes
Could you be an angel
From up above, from up above
So beautiful, beautiful, wonderful
Sent down from heaven for me to love
Oh I love you girl
Your sweet smiling eyes,
Your sweet and smiling eyes
Take me to paradise
It makes me want to cry
Tears of joy whenever I see
Your sweet and smiling eyes,
Sweet and smiling eyes
Your sweet and smiling eyes,
Your sweet and smiling eyes
Sweet and smiling eyes,
Take me to paradise, paradise
It makes me want to cry, tears of joy
Whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes

Drifting, dreaming
In an azure mood
Stardust gleaming
Through my solitude
Here in my seclusion
You're a blue illusion
While I'm in this azure interlude
I'm not wanted
I'm so all alone
Always haunted
By the dreams I own
But though I'm tormented
I must be contented
Drifting, dreaming
In an azure mood
Drifting, dreaming
In an azure mood
Drifting, dreaming
In an azure mood

I'm Alabamy bound
They'll be no heebie-jeebies hanging 'round
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth
All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth
Just hear the choo-choo sound
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground
And then I'll holler so the world will know
Here I go

Oh, I'm packin' my grip and I'm leavin' today
'Cause I'm takin' a trip, California way
I'm gonna settle down and never more roam
And make the San Fernando Valley my home
I'll forget my sins, yes, yes, I'll be makin' new friends
Where the West begins and the sunset ends
'Cause I've decided where yours truly really oughta be
And it's the San Fernando Valley for me
I think that I'm safe in statin', she will be waitin'
When my lonely journey is done
And kindly old Reverend Thomas made us a promise
He will make the two of us one
So, I'm hittin' the trail to the cow country
You can forward my mail, care of R.F.D.
I'm gonna settle down and never more roam
And make the San Fernando Valley my home
I think that I'm safe in statin', she's gonna be waitin'

Dreamy old New England moon
Tell my love I love her so
Tell her that I'll see her soon
Keep her faith in me aglow
Sprinkle her hair with stardust
Shower her eyes with dreams
Tell her we'll meet when roses bloom
Kiss her with your silvery beams
Dreamy old New England moon

Somebody walked into my life
And he's right on time
Somebody looked into my eyes
And he read my mind
And its true
I only need to tell you
That it's you
You're every thing
I ever dreamed would come to me
Somebody walked into my heart
And to my surprise
Somebody tearing me apart
And it feels just fine
And it's you
I've waited oh so long to say
It's you
You're every thing
I ever dreamed
And tonight I give in to the feelings
Tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you
And tonight I give in to believing
I'd hear you say
You'd always stay
Somebody turned my life around
And I'm not the same
Suddenly I don't hear a sound
Only your name
And I really need you
And tonight I give in to the feelings
Yes tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you
And tonight I give in to believing
You'll always stay in love this way
Oh, tonight I give in to the feelings
Yes tonight I give in to them all so hold me
And tonight I give in to believing, darling
You're every thing
I ever dreamed would come to me

I'm goin' away, to a world unknown
I'm goin' away, to a world unknown
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
My rider got somethin', she's tryin'a keep it hid
My rider got somethin', she's tryin'a keep it hid
Lord, I got somethin' to find that somethin' with
I feel like choppin', chips flyin' everywhere
I feel like choppin', chips flyin' everywhere
I been to the Nation, oh Lord, but I couldn't stay there
Some people say them oversea blues ain't bad
[Spoken: Why, of course they are]
Some people say them oversea blues ain't bad
[Spoken: What was a-matter with 'em?!]
It must not a-been them oversea blues I had
Every day seem like murder here
[Spoken: My God, I'm no sheriff]
Every day seem like murder here
I'm gonna leave tomorrow, I know you don't bid my care
Can't go down any dirt road by myself
Can't go down any dirt road by myself
[Spoken: My Lord, who ya gonna carry?]
I don't carry my, gonna carry me someone else

All Harlem's got a brand new rhythm
And it's burning up the dance floors
Because it's so hot
They took a little rhumba rhythm
And they added boogie woogie
And a look what they've go
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie
It's Harlem's new creation
With a Cuban syncopation
It's a killer
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie
The native rhythm haunts you
It's barbaric and it taunts you
It's a killer
Just plant your both feet on each side
Let both your hips and shoulders glide
Then throw your body back and ride
There's nothing like
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie
In Harlem or Havana
You can kiss the old Savanna
It's a killer
Oh, beat me daddy, eight to the bar
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie
It's Harlem's new creation
With a Cuban syncopation
It's a killer
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie
The native rhythm haunts you
It's barbaric and it taunts you
It's a killer
Just plant you toes and both feet on the side
Let both your hips and shoulders glide
Then throw your body back and ride
Think a little of
The rhumba
The boogie
The woogie
Then put them
Both all together
You have rhumboogie
Then all together sing rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie
Rhumboogie
In Harlem or Havana
It'll kiss the old Savanna
It's a killer
It's a killer this rhumboogie
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie
Rhumboogie woogie woogie woogie woogie
Do do do do diddleyada do diddleyada do do dee
There's nothing like rhumboogie

I belong to you and I know I show it
You belong to me, baby; you'd better know it
Give me all your love, sugar, spice, and sweet honey
Don't you ever quit
Not for love or money
I'd do most anything just to amuse you
But there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Thought that I would never lose you
When I play the game, I can't afford to blow it
'Cause I play for keeps; you'd better know it
Yes, I'd do most anything just to amuse you
But there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I ever thought I'd lose you
When I play the game, I can't afford to blow it
'Cause I play for keeps; you better know it

[mr. eon]
I encompass, a circumfrence, of your compass
Smokey the bear's opponent, face atonement
The kama sutra tutor, the mets rooter
Shorties like my slick finger like? bruce sooter?
You caught in this web of the spider
The high and the mighty, might be, slightly, violent
It's high-ly the one to leave the sun rayless
Now your style's cheaply made like a pair of payless
Pick apart your secondary, like jim plunkett
Who woulda thunk it? titanic-ally, i fuckin sunk it
Hope to have a spot like george and wheezy
Chocolate peanut butter shit, like reese's and feces
We sees, the observable, absurdable
My elements enough to make a kid take a pull
No preservatives, but i'm still edible
I need my shit green to remain incredible
Chorus: mr. eon (repeat 2x)
You don't know the half
Half of me want it all, the other half-assed
I'm halfway there
I be, death-defyin, within def rhymin
Periphery, i can see the whole vicinity
[mr. eon]
I be a misfit of science, like andre the giant
You need to shut up, givin divine solids
Amongst two million, i still be the ill one
Multiply two zillion, i'ma still come
With stupidity, turnin santa to satan
Rantin and ravin, while you cave in
See i love the sugar walls, get with my hand though
And waxin off will be the death of me like rambo
Calisthetics, on any premise, yo well it's
The gleam hornet, eon, uncommon
Like brian piccolo's piccolo
Mr. verbal still remain, like vinny delnegro
I shine golden when you see me, like c-3-p-o
I'm po'd, by a microphone b-o
But me though, need the weed green like? grit-o?
Keep that shit tight like grandpa's speedos
Chorus
[mr. eon]
Your pitiful spittle, pales to the hale
In full scale, you're straight monorail
My impact is amtrak, you toy lionel
You're slinkies and weebles fail to prevail
You couldn't even fuck with my echo
You better let go, desperad', face the barrage
You can't mess with eric the derelict
Cherish it, while we smoke on this green relish it
Cause i, huff on dutches, felipe couldn't spark
Step into a spot, thinkin i'm a narc
It's pathetic, my lifestyle is energetic
When i wreck the set, even leon couldn't lett it happen
The high induce the hand-clappin
Hallucinations, that you seen from the rappin
My hands stink, from the snatch i be slappin
Step into the coliseum, what the fuck happened?
Chorus
{"you don't even know the half." -> cut by mighty mi}

He would spend it on the ponies
He would spend it on the girls
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old hennaed curls
And when his wife said, "Hey now
What did you get for me?"
He socked her in the chopper
Such a sweet, sweet guy was he
[Chorus]
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind
How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers
[Chorus]
He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy
No insurance could she find
[Chorus]

July the second, it was nineteen sixty-three
I was servin' time for armed robbery
Four o'clock in the mornin', I was layin' back in my cell
I heard the whistle blow then I heard somebody yell
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Down in cell block number 9
The riot started down in cell block number 4
Spread like wild fire across the prison floor
Scar-face Jones said, "It's too late to quit"
Pass the dynamite 'cause the fuse is lit
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Down in cell block number 9
Y'all gotta stop that stuff goin' on over there
If ya don't stop that riot, y'all gonna get the chair
I said, "Hey now boys, get ready to run
Here come the warden with an automatic gun"
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Down in cell block number 9
In the forty-seventh hour the tear gas
It got our men
We are all back in our cells
But every now and then
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Down in cell block number 9

But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot
Mr. Gob for his squab
A marine for his queen
A G.I. for his cutie-pie is not
'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot

Find a shadow cast by rainbows
There you'll meet the sage.
Feeding rabbits bits of lettuce or cleaning out the cage.
He can give you more direction than you've ever known.
Show you your bronzed baby shoes
Now, my how you have grown!
Ain't it nice to fly? You're waving as soft clouds go by,
But Peace won't be still of its own free will.
Say you want to go exploring, you got to find some truth.
Can't stand one more day of Christians shouting down at you.
You say you don't dig politics that never was your bag.
People who could run for office wave their private flag.
Ain't it nice to fly? You're waving as soft clouds go by,
But peace won't be still of its own free will
Ain't it nice to fly? You're waving as soft clouds go by,
But peace won't be still of its own free will.

Tell me why
I love you like I do
Tell me who
Can stop my heart as much as you
Tell me all your secrets
And I'll tell you most of mine
They say nobody's perfect
Well, that's really true this time
I don't have the answers
I don't have a plan, all I have is you
So darling, help me understand
(What we do)
You can whisper in my ear
(Where we go)
Who knows what happens after here

Living with you in my life
Is like feeling the whole worlds on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
Feeling the sun on my head
Where a cloud used to follow instead
Singing a song in my heart
In a place where all my troubles depart
[Chorus]
If our dreams are falling down to the ground
Let them fly
Let the rain keep falling down
Cause baby I'm high
Now it will fly now that were together oh ho
Love is so high stay this way forever
Living with you in my life
Is like feeling the whole worlds on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
[Chorus]
Our love yeah!
Love will be here forever
I know that well stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that well stay together

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Oh, how am I to know
If it's really love
That's found its way here?
Oh, how am I to know
Will it linger on
And leave me then?
I'll dare not guess
At this strange happiness
But, oh
How am I to know
Can it be that love
Has come to stay here?

I have never been aboard a steamer
I am just content to be a dreamer
Even if I could afford a steamer
I will take the ferry boat every time
I love to ride the ferry
Where music is so merry
There's a man who plays the concertina
On the moonlit upper deck arena
While boys and girls are dancing
While sweethearts are romancing
Life is like a mardi-gras
Funiculi, funicula
Happy, we cling together
Happy, we sing together
Happy, with the ferry boat serenade
I am happy, very, very happy
When we're on the ferry
The music is so merry
There's a man who plays the concertina
On the moonlit upper deck arena, arena
I love to ride the ferry
Where music is so merry
There's a man who always plays the concertina, oh my
On the moonlit upper deck arena, by and by
While the boys and girls are dancing, oh dancing
While, while the sweethearts are romancing
Life is like a mardi-gras
Funiculi, funicula
Happy, we cling together
Happy, we sing together
Happy with the ferry boat serenade
I love to ride the ferry
Sailing, sailing where, where the music is so merry
There's a man who just plays the concertina
On the moonlit upper deck arena
All the while the boys and girls are dancing
Look around and you see sweethearts romancing
Life is like a mardi-gras
Funiculi, funicula
Happy, we cling together
Happy, we sing together
Happy, with the ferry boat serenade

In this life we go through lots of hard times
And we say who knows what the day will bring
We learn to survive 'cause that's the only way
It's kinda nice to talk about the good times
Like the feelin' we all know when the summer comes
That's the reason we all know we are as one
Yesterday is over let's live for today
Good mornin' to the blue skies good-bye to the grey
So come into the sunshine step out of the rain
A new day is arising at daybreak
Everybody together people come into our world
People everybody together
People come into our world
I think it's time to have a celebration
It is time to find another way
To keep movin' on toward a better day, yeah
Yesterday is over let's live for today
Good mornin' to the blue skies
Good-bye to the grey
So come into the sunshine
Step out of the rain
A new way is arising at daybreak
People
Everybody together people come into the world
People everybody together
People come into our world
Whoa our world

Together at daybreak

Together at daybreak

You know I live a charmed, charmed life
I look out to my left and I look to my right
It's simple but in front of me, in back of me
Is nothing more than ecstasy
A charmed, charmed life
You know we live a charmed, charmed life
A little breath of magic and we roll the dice
Now, my darling, I'm for you and you're for me
We are each other's luxury
A charmed, charmed life
Come on over, baby
Kiss me once then twice
Whisper to me softly low, that makes me feel so nice
Come on over darling, and take me to that place
The one that puts a smile upon my face
That says we lead a charmed, charmed life
Just take a little look into each other's eyes
Our biggest little fantasy has turned into reality
You know we live a charmed, charmed life
Come on over, baby
Kiss me once, then twice
Whisper to me softly low, that makes me feel so nice
Come on over darling, and take me to that place
The one that puts a smile upon my face
That says we lead a charmed, charmed life
I look out to my left and I look to my right
It's simple but in front of me, in back of me
Is nothing more than ecstasy
A charmed, charmed life
You know we live a charmed, charmed life
That's it, a little charmed, charmed... life!

I'm praying for rain in California
So the grapes can grow and they can make more wine
And I'm sitting in a honky in Chicago
With a broken heart and a woman on my mind
I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
And they asked who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me
I came here last week from down in Nashville
Cause my baby left for Florida on a train
I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
But in Chicago, the broken heart is still the same
I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask, who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me
I say, a little ole wine drinker me

Never before has my heart felt a thrill like this
Never before
Never before
Never before has the whole world stood still like this
As I gaze at the face I simply adore
After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime
The miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this
Never before
After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime
The miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this
Never before

Did I see moonlight and magnolia trees?
Smile again, my darling, if you please.
Did I hear music on a warm spring breeze?
Speak again, my darling, if you please.
Did I feel cool September rain just then?
If you please, touch my cheek with your hand again.
When you are near me I can dream with ease,
And I'm yours, my darling, if you please

Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Oh, let Your light from the lighthouse shine on
Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Oh, let Your light from the lighthouse shine on
My Lord, he's done just what he said
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Heal the sick and rise the dead
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Oh, let it shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
I know I've got religion and I ain't ashamed
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Angels in Heaven, done wrote my name
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Oh, let it shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Oh, let it shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on well, let shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light shine on me

Who's that girl
The one that I remember
Who was she
With her arms wrapped around the world?
Hold on tight to the days
When you were younger
One fine day
You'll be askin who's that girl
I love the place where I come from
I'm happy where I am
Can't stop chasing the tigers tail
I'm tempted to taste some bitter delight
Why is it so sublime
To loose myself in the moment
Maybe I'll never know
Who's that girl?
When did I last see outside my wsindow
Looking out on the peachy sky
Smelling the sweet sweet air south by the river
With my drink whinched firmly between my thighs
I love the place where I come from
I'm happy where I am
Can't stop chasing the tigers tail
I'm tempted to taste some bitter delight
Why is it so sublime
To loose myself in the moment
Maybe I'll never know
Who's that girl
Why is it so sublime
To loose myself in the moment
Maybe I'll never know
Who's that girl
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Can't stop the tigers tail
I'm tempted to taste some bitter delight
Why is it so sublime
To loose myself in the moment
Maybe I'll never know
Who's that girl
Why is it so sublime
To loose myself in the moment
Maybe I'll never know
Who's that girl
Who's that girl
Who's that girl?

I cannot make it, girl, through the day
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
I cannot seem to make my way
Ah babe, but I can see the wind.
Float in smoke, let it father me
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
What man is doin' doesn't bother me
Ah babe, 'cause I can see the wind.
I do not seem to hear myself
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
I am a part of somethin' else
Ah babe, but I can see the wind.
Shadowed clouds may smother men
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
Letting out the other me
Ah babe, but I can see the wind.
The space around me isn't any more
Ah babe, but I can see the wind
I think I'm standing' but there is no floor
Ah babe, but I can see the wind.
I can see the wind
I can see the wind
I can see the wind
I can see the wind
I can see the wind
I can see the wind
I can see the wind

[Background chorus]
(Peanut do bop do bop)
(Peanut do bop do bop)
In Cuba each merry maid wakes up with this serenade
Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts
If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
you hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)
If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)
If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again
You Peanut Man, that peanut man's gone
(Peanut, peanut, peanut)

Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.
Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.

Up here in the land of the hot dog stand
The atom bomb and the Good Humor Man
We think our South American neighbors are grand
We love 'em to beat the band
South America, babaloo, babaloo, ayyiyi, babaloo
One favor you can do, ayyiyi, you can do
You beautiful lands below, don't know what you began
To put it plainly, I'm tired of shakin'
To that Pan American plan
Take back your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ay, your Conga, ayyiyi
I can't keep movin', ay, my chassis, ay, any longer, ayyiyi
Now maybe Latins, ay, in their middles, ay, are built stronger, ayyiyi
But all this takin' to the quakin' and this makin' with the shakin'
Leaves me achin', ol
First shake around and settle there
Then you shake around and settle here
Then you shake around and settle there
That's enough, that's enough, take it back
My spine's outta whack, there's a strange click, clack
In the back of my Sacroiliac
Take back your Conga, ay, your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ayyiyi
Why can't you send us, ay, a less strenu, ay, ous number, ayyiyi?
I got more bumps now, ay, than on a, ay, cucumber, ayyiyi
While all those Latin drums are cloppin'
Like a Jumpin' Jack I'm hoppin' without stoppin', ol
South America take it away
First you shake around and settle there, where?
Then you shake around and settle here, oh, there
And then you shake around and settle there, why Bing?
That's enough, that's enough, take it back
My spine's outta whack, there's a strange click clack
In the back of my Sacroiliac, oh, my achin' back
Take back your Conga, ay, your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ayyiyi
Bring back the old days, ay, of dancin', I remember, ayyiyi
My hips are crackin' ay, I am shriekin' ay carumba, ayyiyi
I got a wriggle and a diddle and a jiggle like a fiddle in my middle, ol
This fancy swishin' imposition wears out
All of my transmission ammunition, ol
Though I like neighborly relations all these crazy new gyrations
Try my patience, ol, South America, take it away

Lovely lady, dressed in blue,
Teach me how to pray
Cause God was just your little boy,
And you know the way
Did you lift him up sometimes,
Gently on your knee
Did you tell him stories of the world,
Like Mother did to me
And when he fell, did you lift him up,
And make everything alright
And did you tell him his prayers at night
I want to know my lovely lady, lovely lady,
Dressed, dressed in blue
Oh, God was just your little boy,
Your little boy and you know the truth
And did you whisper in his ear sweet lullabyes,
I want to know, I want to know,
I want to know, did he cry
Lovely lady, dressed in blue,
Oh won't you please teach me how to pray
Cause God was just your little boy, and
I want to know, I want to know,
I want to know, so teach me how to pray
Teach me how to pray

I keep going over it and over it again in my mind
I get these flashbacks and I feel so good
This is one night that I'll never forget
You see, it was just like in the movies
I mean, it actually happened just like this...
The stars were shining brighter than most of the time
Then love came out of nowhere
No thrill will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night
(The night when I fell in love)
The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you
I've known so many people, been to most parts of the world
And seen some things that have blown my mind, but...

Baby I need your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now
Baby
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile
Because
I'm not livin', baby
I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
I don't care if I stay like this, because
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile
When I feel the hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin' (right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head and I sigh and reply
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile
(Baby I need your good lovin')
Sometimes I feel like a wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within
(Baby I need your good lovin')
I need you my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend
So come and fill my empty arms and
Fill my empty life
(Baby I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it
(Baby I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it because
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile

Oh well, where were you now, baby,
Clarksdale mill burned down.
Oh well, where were you now, baby,
Clarksdale mill burned down.
I were way down Sunflower,
With my face all fulla frowns.
Lord, I think I heard the Helena whistle,
Helena whistle,
Helena whistle blow.
Lord, I ain't gonna stop walkin'
Till I get in my rider's door

Hello love
Awfully glad you've found me
Hello love
Spread your glow around me
The door's been open
But where have you been?
I've been here hopin' you'd let yourself in
And grin and
Hello love
I can tell you're near me
Hello love
Now at last you hear me
I know someday you'll be returning up above
What's that, you say
You're here to stay
Hello, hello love
Hello love
I can tell you're near me
Hello love
Now at last you hear me
I know someday you'll be returning up above
What's that, you say
You're here to stay
Hello, hello love

Everyone knows she's a rambling rose, she's a beauty growing wild
Birds in their nests seem to whistle their best
Mother Nature's favorite child
She's got that kind of affection that just winds around your heart
You'd better run for protection or she might upset your flower cart
Hate to disclose that my rambling rose is gonna meet her Waterloo
I'll let her play but she can't get away 'cause I know just what to do
Anyone knows you can train a rose to be a clinging vine
So from this day hence there'll be a picket fence round that rambling rose of mine
She's got that kind of affection that just winds around your heart
You'd better run for protection or she might upset your flower cart
Hate to disclose that my rambling rose is gonna meet her Waterloo
I'll let her play but she can't get away 'cause I know just what to do
Anyone knows you can train a rose to be a clinging vine
So from this day hence there'll be a picket fence round that rambling rose of mine

T'was just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray
The raindrops kissed the flowerbeds
The blossoms raised their leafy heads
A perfumed thank you
They seemed to say
Surely here was charm beyond
Compare to view
Maybe it was just that
I was there with you
T'was just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way

San Francisco Fan
Loved a no-good gamblin' man;
She drank the coffee dregs so she could fry his eggs
In a golden fryin' pan.
Can-canned by command,
Of the Gold Rush Cafe clan,
She gave her man her pay; he gambled it away
Playing Chinatown fan-tan.
Once they caught him cheatin'
And he knew that he was beaten,
When a miner aimed a pistol at his head,
Fanny, when she seen 'em,
Ran and jumped right inbetween 'em,
And she stopped a dozen slugs of poison lead.
There was Fanny dyin'
While a hundred men were cryin'
And the angels up above were cryin', too;
When seven horses started draggin'
Fanny's coffin in a wagon
Down a dusty California avenue.
San Francisco Fan
Gave her life to save her man,
A man who wasn't worth a shovelful of earth
From the grave of San Francisco Fan.
San Francisco Fan
Gave her life to save a man,
A man who wasn't worth a shovelful of earth
From the grave of San Francisco Fan.

Old enough to be her dad
But the young men were just mad they nursed their grievances
And she was flattered by his charm
It wouldn't do her any harm they all had their chances
He sent her flowers and limousines
She was treated like a queen
Anything she ever wanted
It was no problem for a man like him
And everyone expected soon
That she could ask him for the moon if she would wear his ring
Knowing glances from his friends
In the homes at the weekends of high society
But he didn't give a damn
He never felt more like a man
And all the time the clock was ticking
And all would envy
The older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes all would envy
In a house upon a hill
She was there with time to kill
She lived a life she'd only dreamed
The life was never what it seemed
To all her friends that she'd ignored
She denied that she was bored
She had no time for dancing - no time for dancing
But the clock upon the wall
That was ticking in the hall always reminded her
That life was going on elsewhere
But she was happy and she whould swear she wouldn't change a thing
And all would envy
The older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes all would envy
Now its five o'clock am
She must have spent the night again with that old friend of hers
She loves to dance
She's missing more and more these days
But he's still stuck in his old ways
Perhaps she needs a little more romance
But the clock upon the wall is still ticking in the hall
She must be home soon - soon
Where a younger man would weep
He takes a pill and goes to sleep
Now who would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife?
Who would envy? Who would envy?

[Chorus]
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
And it's good enough for me.
It was good for our mothers.
It was good for our mothers.
It was good for our mothers.
And it's good enough for me.
[Chorus]
Makes me love everybody.
Makes me love everybody.
Makes me love everybody.
And it's good enough for me.
[Chorus]
It will take us all to heaven.
It will take us all to heaven.
It will take us all to heaven.
And it's good enough for me.

21
Oh life has just begun
Got a temper like a gun
Pointing it at everyone
That's his game
And it helps him to get through the day
But a voice inside him says
How much longer can I play
[Chorus]
He's got infinite possibilities
I can see them now
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound
He's got infinite possibilities
I can feel them now
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down
Peace of mind
Is not easy for him to find
And he's walkin' a thinner line
In a place where another man is keeping his time
Though he's young
He's not like everyone
He sees what he's become
And he'd rather be standing in the sun
[Chorus]
[Chorus 2x]
With infinite possibilities
Infinite...possibilities
Stand in the sun and see

i was standin at the train statio nwith a guitar in my hand
then i went ot airport with my guiatr in my hand
i went looking for my baby who flew off with another man
she said that she was going
that i couldn't believe
yeah she said she was going
that i couldnt' believe
well i didnt' even realize it
when my baby packed up to leave
gave all my money
gave al i could
gave all my lovin
but that didnt' do no good
yes i'nm a ??
well i know you can't understand
ell i'm standin here at the airport
with my guitar in my hand

I believe that if I had my sweet woman's heart, in my hand, in my hand
I believe that if I had my sweet woman's heart, in my hand, in my hand
I believe I could teach her, how to treat a real good man
I drink so much whiskey mama
I can't hardly talk, hardly talk, sweet mama hardly talk
I drink so much whiskey mama, I can't hardly talk, hardly talk
Well it's done addled on my brain, people I can't hardly walk
How my poor heart weeped and worried
Baby when you drove me away, sweet mama drove me away
How my poor heart weeped and worried, baby when you drove me away
It was crying for poor boy McTell, some old rainy day
Climbing on the Lookout Mountain
Look dived in Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls, sweet mama Niagara Falls
Climbing on the Lookout Mountain, look dived in Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls
Seem like to me, I can hear my Atlanta mama call
Don't grieve and worry, and don't fret after me, after me
Don't fret and worry, and don't grieve after me, after me
Don't you scream and cry, because I'm going back to Tennessee
Can't read and write, can't even spell my name, spell my name
Can't read and write, can't even spell my name
You drove me away, and drove my heart insane

It's that ole devil called love game
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shock again
Put a ring in my eyes
Tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart
It's that sly ole sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that ring
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart
Suppose I didn't stay and ran away
Wouldn't play
That devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
He'd follow around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
With that ole devil called love

Just ask the lonely
When you feel that need
To make it all alone
Remember no one is thinking of
Going alone
Just ask the lonely
They know the hurt and pain,
Of losing a love, you can never regain
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
The young and foolish laugh at love (Woo hoo)
So they run away (Woo hoo hoo hoo)
Confident and sure that fate (Woo hoo)
Will bring another love their way
(Ah) But ask the lonely
(Ah) How vainly a heart can yearn
(Ah) For losing a love that will never return
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
They'll tell you
Ooh, Woo hoo hoo hoo ooh
(Ah) They'll tell you a story of sadness
(Ah) A story too hard to believe
Ah, they'll tell you the loneliest one is me
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
Ask me
I'm the loneliest one you'll see
Just ask the lonely

All She Wants To Do Is Rock
Hold back the door
Stop all the clocks
I just got the news that my baby wants to rock
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
Rock and Roll all night long
Well, my baby don't like no fancy clothes
High class dinners or picture shows
When it comes to lovin', she knows what it's about
But when she huckle-bucks she knocks me out
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
Rock and Roll all night long
My baby don't like airplanes
She don't like those streamline trains
She just wants to stay at home
And huckle buck her daddy all night long
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
She wants to rock with the clock
But she don't know when to stop
Well, my baby gets her kicks every day
She rocks her fine little self away
She rocks in the basement, she rocks upstairs
I can't take it no more
I'm gonna have to get me a rockin chair
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
All she wants to do is rock
She wants to rock with the clock
but she don't know when to stop.

Sigh into your cup of coffee
As you watch the morning news
There goes your good day
There's the knot on the noose
Pop a pill and thus a smile
Feign contentment for a while
That's all you know how to do
When the wool is off your eyes
You'll stop counting sheep at night
'Cause you'll get your fill of them
During the day time.
Medicine to make you thin
But puts an end to your dreamin'
Bleeding together--
The nights seem to stretch on forever
Morning comes a day too soon
You're back inside your tiny room
Waiting for something
So good at doing nothing
When the wool is off your eyes
You'll stop counting sheep at night
'Cause you'll get your fill of them
During the day time.
As the sunlight filters in
There your daily dread sets in
The cycle's beginning
And in your head, alarms are ringing
Something in you's fast asleep
Afraid to be who you will be
It's a losing battle,
So why are you still fighting?
When the wool is off your eyes
You'll stop counting sheep at night
'Cause you'll get your fill of them
During the day time.
Are you sleeping,
Are you sleeping,
Brother John?
Bells are ringing
Bells are ringing
Ding, ding, dong

Sometimes I feel like an innocent one
To deserve this fate what I have I ever done
I know that I made all the rules
But time can even change the hopeless ways of fools
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I won't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why
All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it
Who's looking after this see-through heart
Someone up there isn't doing their part
Oh Cupid you foolish boy
You should take better aim with your brand new toy
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I don't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why
All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it
So if I die before I wake
The innocent one whose heart could never break
Lift me up take me out of this bed
Watching the angels shake their heads
Don't feel sorry for me baby honey don't you cry
You can sell all of my clothes you will forget me by and by
I'll be riding that train I'll be singing that song
But I won't be gone for long
'Cause the angels won't have it
All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

I'm an orange moon
I'm an orange moon
Reflecting the light of the sun
Many nights he was alone
Many, many, many nights
His light was so bright that they turned away
And he stood alone
Every night and every day
Then he turned to me
He saw his reflection in me
And he smiled at me when he turned to me
Then he said to me
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
I'm an orange moon
I'm brighter than before
Brighter than ever before
I'm an orange moon and I shine so bright
'cause I reflect the light of my sun
I praise the day, he turned my way
And smiled at me
He gets to smile and I get to be orange, that I love to be
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
(oh...)
Shine so bright
(oh...)
He ruled the day, I ruled the night
(oh...)
Shine, shine, shine
(oh...)
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good he is, how god is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how god is
How good it is, how good it is
I'm an orange moon
I'm brighter than before, brighter
Reflecting the light of the sun
Smile at me

I feel a song comin' on
And I'm warning ya
It's a victorious
Happy and glorious new strain!
I feel a song comin' on
It's a melody!
Full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain!
You'll hear a tuneful story
Ringin' thru ya!
Love and glory!
Hallelujah!
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'
Cause I feel a song comin' on!
I feel a song comin' on
And I'm warning ya
It's a victorious
Happy and glorious new strain!
I feel a song comin' on
It's a melody!
Full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain!
You'll hear a tuneful story
Ringin' thru ya!
Love and glory!
Hallelujah!
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'

Look around you my people
If you look then you will see
How to love, life is paradise all together
What game shall we play today?
Man just wants to be happy
Cast off things that shouldn't be
Set him free, life is paradise all together
What game shall we play today?
There's a way you can find it
It's within you, can't you see
Find the truth, it's not impossible all together
What game shall we play today?
Here we are all together
Free to have and do and be
What we see, for the first time all together
What game shall we play today?

Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will
Know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my
Friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans
Fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there
Drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

If I sent a rose to you for every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white for every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses
[Chorus]
If you'd took the petals and tore 'em all apart
You'd be tearing half the roses just the way you tore my heart
And if some day you're feeling blue you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you
You'd have a room full of roses
You'd have a room full of roses

Watching the world go by (watching the world go by)
Under a sunny sky (sunny sky)
Strolling 'round the park on a Sunday afternoon (Sunday afternoon)
Oh how the moments fly (oh how the moments fly)
Watching the world go by (the world go by)
When you're with your love
Life is a beautiful tune (life is a beautiful tune)
Even if clouds are there
Way up above
For us the day is always fair 'cause we're in love
Others may have some tears, others may cry
Darling not you and I (not you and I)
We'll spend years and years and years
Watching the world go by
(Watching the world go by) Some day Sunday
(Under a sunny sky) When church is through love
(Strolling round the park on Sunday afternoon) Hand and hand 'neath a crimson sky
We will dream as the world goes by
(Oh how the moments fly) One day one day,
(Watching the world go by ) Dreams will come true love
(When you're with your love ) They'll be beautiful days to see
(Life is a beautiful tune) In the future with me
(Even if clouds are there) Each tomorrow
(Way up above) We'll be fair
(For us the day is always fair 'cause we're in love) Free from sorrow just as long as you care
Others may have some tears (others may have some tears)
Darling not you and I (not you and I)
We'll spend years and years and years
Watching the world go by

(David Christopher)
I asked a question looked to the sky
Waited to hear a reply
I wanted to know
What the future would hold
Would I spend my life looking for you
The waiting is over today
The waiting is over forever
I noticed a feeling awake in my heart
The moment my eyes turned to you
A warmth in my soul
That slowly took hold
The power of love takes control
The waiting is over today
The waiting is over forever
As I turned away I noticed a smile
A joyous gleam in your eye
I headed out laughing
You by my side
Together the rest of our life
Oh the waiting is over today
Yeah the waiting is over for ever
The waiting is over today
The waiting is over

(with Jerry Lewis)
I'm your chum (JL) I forgot you're my chum
I'm your friend (JL) Through thick and thin
I'm your pal (JL) That's right you're my pal
'Til you die (JL) Already I'm sick
Which reminds me when you were sick remember how I nursed you
Stayed by your side and wouldn't go away
(JL) Yeh but what have you done for me lately
(JL) What did you do for me today
Today, everyday

Just say I love her
I've loved her from the start
And tell her how I'm yearning
To say what's in my heart
Just say I need her
As roses need the rain
And tell her that without her
My dreams are all in vain
If you should chance to meet her
Anytime anywhere
I was a fool to leave her
Tell her how much a fool can care
And if she tells you
She's lonely now and then
Won't you just say I love her
And want her back again
Won't you just say I love her
And want her back again

Passion flower
Sent from the blue above
You're a flower of love
Passion flower
Free as a star in flight
Laughing through the night
Your lips keep taunting me
Not wanting me
Yet haunting me
Each day
Stay with me
My passion flower
You are all I'm dreaming of
Passion flower of love
Passion flower of love

Forget if you can
Romantic music one magical night
A corner table in dim candle light
A kiss that was heaven for two
Forget if you can
The day we hiked to where nobody knows
The swell spaghetti at Tony and Joe's
It hasn't been fun without you
Don't you remember
All the silly things we used to do
The way we laughed
When we were photographed
As Handsome Hat and his ten-timing gal
Why shouldn't we play
More happy moments like we used to spend
They were so perfect
Too perfect to end
Let your heart forget it you can

I want to be, no one but me
I am in love with a lover
Who likes me the way I am
I have my faults, he likes my faults
I'm not very bright, he's not very bright
He thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me
He may be wrong, but if we get along
What do we care? Say we
When he holds me close, close as we can be
I tell the lad that I'm grateful and I'm glad that
I'm nobody else but me
I was a shy, demure type, inhibited, insecure type of girl
A pearl, of no great price was I
Till a certain cutie called me sweetie pie
Now I'm smug and snooty and my head is high
I want to be, no one but me
I may be wrong, but if we get along
What do we care? Say we
When he holds me close, close as we can be
Say I tell the lad that I'm grateful and I'm glad that
I'm nobody else, nobody else
Don't wanna be nobody else but me

Float
Without rest
Like the space
Between
The nightwalker's eyes
Lost
In its caves
Then I stopped
Climbed the bank
To see the game
Summer red fragrances around the lids
Green fishes flickering under the skin...

It must have taken a long long time to make a woman like you
Ooh baby, cause you're so, so fine
He took the stars from the sky, put the sparkle in your eye
Baby, don't you know, you're my only desire
When I enter the room, I smell your perfume
The taste of your lips is like the nectar from the Gods
And the sunlight on your hair, is just like spun gold
After God made you, he broke the mold
God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
To describe how your body feels when you're next to me
Like rockin' and rollin' on a stormy, stormy sea
You bring me up, oh and then you take me down,
Then you take me to heaven and back down to the ground
You're just like a rose, blooming in the spring
You're everything a man could want
Everything a man could need
And at night I fall down, on my knees
And thank God for sending an angel, just to love me
God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
Girl, let me touch you, make sure it's not a dream
If it is please don't awake me, it would be so so mean
The thought of ever losing you is more than I could bear
It just wouldn't be heaven no more if you were not there
God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
God made you for me (I thank God)
You're my dream come true (from high up above)
And I don't want another woman (for sending you to me)
All I need is you (for me to love)
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
Cause I love you girl, Oh I love you girl
All I need is you
You're everything to me
And my lifes complete

Autonomy and chemistry
And then its silly you, and then silly me
I'm feeling good and I'm feeling mighty bad
You got to treasure before the good turns bad
Autonomy and chemistry
And then its silly you, and then silly me
I'm feeling good and I'm feeling mighty bad
You got to treasure before the good turns bad
We take
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten
And yes it gets emotional
Those feeling that come up between a boy and girl
And all those words you said you know you didn't mean
The ears that heard them now are feeling very sad
Understanding is the thing, the key
To open locks that you never believed to even see
And something there in your very heart
Knows that you'll both be there and you'll never part
We take
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten
Domestic bliss on a cloud named nine
Sweet sexiness, soft caress could be be yours and mine
A cloud named nine
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
Two steps forward and then ten steps back
And then the girls sing
And then the boys sing
Lets sing together
Good thoughts and feelings into the love machine
Good thoughts and feelings into the love machine
Good thoughts and feelings into the love machine
Good thoughts and feelings into the love machine
We're malfunctioning like robot love
We're malfunctioning like robot love
We're malfunctioning like robot love
We're malfunctioning like robot love

Just look
Just look what the Lord has done
Lord I know
Lord I know I'm coming home
It was one morning, when (the cat come?) in the room
Oh hush
Oh hush, somebody is calling me
It was one morning, (when you get some) in the room
Oh death
Oh death, has killed my mother-in-law (mother and pa?)
Oh moon, my pillow? turned my bed around?
Oh hush

The last time I thought about leavin'
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true, true love never dies
The first time I
Thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome
Miles out of town
But my foolish pride
Kept these wheels a-turnin'
Yeah, there was nothin'
On this earth gonna shut me down
But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
Well, the fires of anger turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you, by and by
The lonesome is not surely passin'
That ol' true, true love never dies
Well, if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
No, it never does
Well, if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
Well, I'd sail back to her
On an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
Well, I'd sail back to her
On an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
Oh, it never dies, no, it never does
No, no, no
True, true love
True, true love
True, true love

Well, this is my first affair, please be kind
Handle my heart with care, please be kind
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand, they'll never, never fade
So tell me your love's sincere, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, please be kind
Cause if you leave me, dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind
This is my first affair, so a-please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh a-please be kind
So tell me your love's sincere, yes, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, please be kind
Cause if you leave me, dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, baby, please be kind

Sierra Sue, I'm sad and lonely
The rocks and rills are lonely too
Sierra Sue, I want you only
No one but you, Sierra Sue
The roses weep, their tears are falling
The gentle doves no longer coo
Oh, can't you hear my sad heart calling
Calling for you, Sierra Sue

My love don't change
There's going to be some stealing
My love don't change
There's going to be some stealing done
And if I backbite you
I don't mean no harm
What do you want with a woman
When she won't do nothing you say
What do you want with a woman
When she won't do nothing you say
What do you want with a rooster
When he won't crow 'fore day
If my love don't change
There's going to be some riding done
If my love don't change
There's going to be some riding done
And if I take you woman
I just be made my run
Going in one of these alleys
Get me some lonesome booze
Going in one of these alleys
Get me a quart of this lonesome booze
My woman done left me
I got these love changing blues
Songwriters: MCTELL, WILLIE

My man's got somethin', he gives me such a thrill
Every time he smiles at me, I can't keep my body still
I done cried so much, look like I've got the mumps
I can't keep from worryin', 'cause I'm down in the dumps
I had a nightmare last night, when I laid down
When I woke up this mornin', my sweet man couldn't be found
I'm goin' down to the river, into it I'm goin' to jump
Can't keep from worryin', 'cause I'm down in the dumps
Someone knocked on my door, last night when I was asleep
I thought it was that sweet man of mine, makin' his 'fore day creep
Wasn't nothin' but my landlord, a great big chump
Stay away from my door, Mr. Landlord, 'cause I'm down in the dumps
When I woke up, my pillow was wet with tears
Just one day from that man of mine
Seems like a thousand years
But I'm gonna straighten up, straighter than Andy Gump
Ain't no use of me tellin' that lie, 'cause I'm down in the dumps

Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me, dear
Some little something, meaning love can not die,
No matter where you chance to be.
Though I'll pray for you, night and day for you;
It will see me through like a charm,
Till you're returning.
So give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me.
Though I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm
Till your returning
So give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me.

It was winter in manhattan
Falling snowflakes filled the air
The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I'd heard about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just withn a trice
You bought me violets for my furs
And it was spring for a while, remember?
You bought me violets for my furs
And there was april in that december
The snow drifted on the flowers and melted where it lay
The snow looked leke dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day
You bought me violets for my furs
Aand there was blue in the wintry	sky
You pinned the violets to my furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day you bought me violets for my furs

If you wanna do right by your appetite,
If you're fussy about your food,
Take a choo-choo today, head New England way,
And we'll put you in the happiest mood. with:

Your tummy say "Howdy."
Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy

Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan dowdy makes the sun come out
When Heavens are cloudy,
Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy,
I never get enough of that wonderful stuff!
Mama! When you bake,
Mama! I don't want cake;
Mama! For my sake
Go to the oven and make some ever lovin' Sh,
Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy
Makes your eyes light up,
Your tummy say "Howdy,"
Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy

Here's my philosophy
Livin' in a penitentiary

When you're drinkin
When you're drinkin
The show
looks good to you
When you're drinkin
you get stinkin
it helps your
point of view
but when you're sober
the skies all seem grey
when you're sober
Life's a pain
So keep drinkin
that's what Im thinkin
cause its what I
Love to do!

Where are you, now that I want you
Now that I want you so badly I could cry
Where are you, where did fate lead you
Funny how I dreamed you'd still be standin' by
I had you at my beck and call
I called you anytime at all
I guess I took too much for granted
I never thought I'd lie awake and sign
Where are you, now that I need you
Now that I love you so madly I could die
I had you at my beck and call
I called you anytime at all
I guess I took too much for granted
I never thought I'd lie awake and sigh
Where are you, now that I need you
Now that I love you so madly I could die
Where are you, baby, now that I need you
So madly that I could die

High on a windy hill
I feel my heart stand still
All I can hear you calling my name
Into a misty blue
I go in search of you
There in the shadows calling your name
Why are you just beyond me
When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space
Oh, into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name
Into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name

I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there
But she never comes
And I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day
Without her
It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door
To an empty room
You go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun
When you have to spend another day
Without her
We burst the pretty balloon took us to the moon
It's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now
And it sounds like a lie
I said I'd rather die than live without her
Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing
And it moves like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
And it's breaking my heart
To have to spend a day without her,
Can't go on without her

Chorus:
My man called me this morning
My man called me this morning
Stop
Listen
This is what he said:
He said "Hello Baby"
My sweetie's voice did sound
He called me angel
My head went round and round
Chorus
He told me that he loved me
That he was still my guy
He said that he want me
'til the sun fell from the sky
Chorus
He warned me every morning
He warned me every night
That he'll keep on smiling
And always treat me right
Chorus
He would really make me happy
He would do and give me anything
Buy a little house on a hill
A diamond wedding ring
Chorus out

I don't make no money
I tell you nothing about that, so strange
I stand here with my tears rolling down
I turn my last note into change
Just one debt you start my day without you here
Point to me, I'll walk away, you disappear
Seems you cut deep, yes you cut cold
I've got nothing left here anymore
But I don't care
The more I pay
The less I feel
The money comes
The money goes
It's all the same
But I don't care
The more you take
The less I feel
The paper lines
And worlds that are mine
What is this, we disappear
I want you to hold my hand and let go
I can't, I don't want to take control
Seems like you've forsaken up my mind
Crumbling to dust up my soul

She shimmers like the surface of a swimming pool Staring out of blue horizon eyes She's flippin' through the pages of the interview She winces at the passing of a careless thought Like a closed blonde door Her fingernails are diamond white Of butchered bodies in the morgue And then she shakes her hair across her eyes A pastel sunset colored the sky, the city below them The crime wasn't low self-esteemed this time, they joked As they loaded in the back door for a couple of stiffs Up on skyline drive He points down to the place that he lives from Up on skyline drive Marble furniture the color of toothpaste She sits beside the pool out in the sun And menstruates in a silver cup Teabag floats as if an astronaut in space Sentry system picking up a bearded man Up in the helicopter cameras roll as he's shot to death He's muttering under his breath

The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road, I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms a'reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm, we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home

We're kids no more baby, we belong you and me together
I vowed never to do you wrong, and shall always keep you happy, (together)
Now dear the things that I need are very few
But there is one thing, that I demand of you
Just be true, to me, just be true
Don't be offended from the things I've said
For I know it will never be that bad
But my dear, I couldn't help but let 'cha know
That if you should leave me, it would hurt me so
nah nah nah nah
I've given you all of me, and and plan to give even more, baby
My true love and a sweet affection, and there's even more in store,
baby

My height, just average
My weight, just average
And my IQ is like you'd estimate, just average
But evidently he does not agree
Consequently if I seem at sea
It amazes me, it simply amazes me
What he sees in me dazzles me
Dazes me
That I've learned to clip my wings
And soften my ways
These are ordinary things unworthy of praise
Yet he praises my
Just knowing I try for him
When so many would
If they could, die for him
I'm the one who's worldly wise
And nothing much fazes me
But to see me in his eyes
It just amazes me
I'm the one who's worldly wise
And nothing much fazes me
But to see me in his eyes
It just amazes me

One lonely night I stumbled upon a dream
In my ordinary world,
With eyes like an angel,
A voice like a song from the heart,
You came into my world
You crossed a river of time,
You climbed a mountain of hope,
Yes you did,
You brought me all the love that I've been living for,
And now I can only ask for one thing more,
Just to have and to hold you,
Inspire and console you,
And be with you every day,
Be with you every day,
I want to love and adore you,
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
Be with you every day of my life
Just like the stars,
Shining down from the heavens,
Into my solitary world,
Just like the glow that comes when the rain is over,
Bringing warmth to the world,
You are the dawn of my day,
Yes you are,
You are the lantern that lights my way,
You are the love that I cherish in my heart,
I pray to heaven that we never part,
I want to have and to hold you,
Inspire and console you,
And be with you every day,
Be with you every day,
I want to love and adore you,
Do anything for you,
And be with you every day,
Be with you every day,

Oh, oh oh oh
yeah ay ay ay
There's someone on my mind tonight
I don't know where he's coming from
I hope I'm not just making this up
(Huh)
I've got good intuition
Not one for superstition but when
It comes to loving somebody
I'll believe most anything
'Cause I long for my heart to share a love everlasting
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
Someone to climb to heaven with me
Oh ho, oh, oh
I wanna love somebody
Yes I'm gonna love somebody
Someone who wants to love only me
Oh ho, oh, oh
I'm walking on a thin line
I'm trying to believe that in time
Someone will dream about me all night
They say you just gotta wait
That love come with fate
But I know that there's a star made for everyone
And it's watching over me
If I could only see him, have him, hold him, know him
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
Someone to climb to heaven with me
Oh,
I wanna love somebody
Yes I wanna love somebody
Someone who wants to love only me
(Loves only me)
Oh,
I wanna know his name
I wanna feel his pain
Cause once I love him it will be forever
And that's the way it could be
And that's the way it should be
Oh,
I wanna love somebody (I wanna love somebody)
I wanna love somebody (oh oh)
Someone to climb to heaven with me
Love only me
I wanna love somebody (I wanna love somebody)
I wanna love somebody
(Oh oh oh)
To heaven with me
Love only me
I wanna love somebody (I wanna love somebody)
I wanna love somebody
'Till the end of time

My devotion
Is endless and deep as the ocean
And like a star shining from afar
Remains forever the same
Oh, my devotion
Is not just a sudden emotion
It will be constantly burning
And your love will kindle the flame
What a sweet beginning
To the dream I had planned
All I own is yours alone
Your wish is my command
And this sensation
Was never a mere fascination
Here in my heart, one sweet day, it started
Then with time improved my devotion to you

From the second we met
I didn't know what to do
I knew it right then babe
That I was in love with you.
From the light of the moon
I can see your face
And I'm hoping that soon babe
We can have our own place
That house on the hill
That place we will live
Our time we can kill babe
Our love we can give
Living life with you
Seems like the easiest thing
You make my everyday babe
You make my heart sing.
I'm with you forever
And forever more
And I could never
Explain my love in words
Behind the mountains
I can see the sunrise
It relieves the pain babe
That I see in your eyes
Baby please come back
Just come back to me
You're the one that I want babe
You're the one that I need
I feel I'm going crazy
Being so far from you
You're the one that I want babe
I'm in love with you.

There's a famous thoroughfare
I've heard collegiates say
I'm not referring to Piccadilly
It's not 42nd Street
It's not the rue de la Paix
Nor is it Market Street in Philly
Ask most any college Romeo
To complete your education you must go....
Down the old ox road
Though you'll never find where it is
By looking in maps
With a little investigation you'll discover perhaps
That this old tradition's not a place
But just a proposition called
The old ox road
The old ox road
Ox road could be any romantic spot
A country highway or a moonlit yacht
It could be in the parlor
When the lights are burning low
It could be in the movie
In the very last row
Down the old ox road
In the magic of the moonlight
You are filled with delight
While the leaves that flutter o'er you
Whisper lover tonight
Why keep waiting, and debating
When you know it's time for mating
On the old ox road
On the old ox road

(01) I AM NOT AFRAID
Who knows what it will be,-I don't so why should I worry?,-If you think you know more than me,-keep it for yourself,'cause I don't wanna know,-You can think what you want,-I know you're not the only one,who thinks to know the end,-well I don't believe in ends 'cause I believe in him
I am not afraid to love him,-I am not afraid to let him know,-I am not afraid to show them,-I am not afraid no,-
I am not afraid to leave him,-I am not afraid to let him go,-I am not afraid to hold on to it,-I am not afraid 'cause this is beautiful,-
If I believe in what you say,-of course things might end up that way,-'cause words are strong and so is faith,-it is my belief that can make things change,-I used to be like you,-I based my plans on what I thought I knew,-but when things came they were different,-That's when I understood I didn't know a thing.
I am not afraid to love him,-I am not afraid to let him know,-I am not afraid to show them,-I am not afraid no,-
I am not afraid to leave him,-I am not afraid to let him go,-I am not afraid to hold on to it,-I am not afraid 'cause this is beautiful (choir)

I drove a herd of cattle out from old Nebraska way
That's how I come to be in the state of I O Way
I met a gal in I O Way, her eyes were big and blue
I asked her what her name was and she said, "Sioux City Sue"
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue
I'd swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue
I asked her if she had a beau, she said, "Yes quite a few"
But still I started callin' her my sweet Sioux City Sue
The first time that I stole a kiss, I caught her stealing too
I asked her did she love me,and she said, "Indeed I do"
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue
I'd swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue
Now I'm admittin' I-O-Way, I owe a lot to you
'Cause I come from Nebraska to find Sioux City Sue
I'm gonna rope and tie her up, I'll use my ol' lassoo
I'm gonna put my brand on my sweet Sioux City Sue
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue
I'd swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue

A junkie walking through the twilight
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it,
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes to watch me die
You keep saying, kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it
God, but did you ever try
To turn your sick soul inside out
So that the world, so that the world
Can watch you die
Home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks
Try to heal my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never, if I never went home again
Home again
Home again
Home again

Evelina, won't ya ever take a shine to that moon?
Evelina, ain't ya bothered by the bobolink's tune?
Tell me, tell me how long
Ya gonna keep delayin'the day.
Don't ya reckon it's wrong
Trifflin' with April this way?
Evelina, won't ya pay a little mind to me soon?
Wake up! wake up!
The earth is fair, the fruit is fine
But what's the use o' smellin' winter water melon
Clingin' to another fella's vine?
Evelina, won't ya roll off that vine an' be mine?

I hate men!
I can't abide them, even now and then!
Than ever marry one of them I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother!
Of course I'm awfully glad that mother deigned to marry father!
But I hate men!
Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy!
He may have hair upon his chest, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh I hate men!
I hate men!
They should be kept like piggys in a pen!
Don't wear a travelling salesman, though a tempting tom he may be,
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby!
While he's away in Mandalay, 'tis thee who'll have the baby!
Oh I hate men!
I hate men!
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen!
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism;
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism!
Oh I hate men!

You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ole rain's fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away
Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Yesterday's love was like a warm summer breeze
But, like the weather ya changed
Now things are dreary, baby
And it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' your name
Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Bring back that sunny day

Glow little glow worm flier fire
Glow like an incandescent wire
Glow for the female of the specie
Turn on the AC and the DC
This night could use a little brightening
Light up your little bug of lightning
When you gotta glow you gotta glow
Glow little glow worm glow
Glow little glow worm turn the key on
You are equipped with tail light neon
You got a cute vest pocket Mazda
Which you can make both slow or faster
I don't know who you took a shine to
Or who you're out to make a sign to
I gotta gal that I love so glow little glow worm glow
Glow little glow worm glow
Glow little glow worm glow

Once upon a lovely time
Many million dreams ago
Once there was a man in love dear
Many million dreams ago
Once he thought he had a sweetheart
Then he broke the golden rule
Never take your love for granted
Wise men often play the fool
Now he'd like to say I'm sorry
Can't you see within his heart
Without you there's no tomorrow
Why should true love have to part
Take me in your arms
I promise to be true
Never again I'll stray
Away from you

Old Peter Minuet had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhattan
For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze and they threw in the Bronx and Staten
Pete thought that he had the best of the bargin but the poor red man just grinned,
And he grunted "ugh!" meaning okay in his jargon for he knew poor Pete was skinned.
We`ve tried to run the city....but the city ran away...
And now Peter Minuet
We can`t continue it...
Broadway`s turning into Coney,
Champagne Charlie`s drinking gin,
Old New York is new and phony
Give it back to the Indians!
Two cents more to smoke a Lucky,
Dodging buses keep you thin,
Now New York is simply ducky,
Give it back to the Indians!
Take all the reds, on the boxes made for soap
Whites on Fifth Avenue
Blues down in Wall Street losing hope..
Big bargain today...Chief take it away!
Come you busted city slickers,
Better take it on the chin
Father Nick has lost his knickers
Give it back to the Indians!
Take all the reds, on the boxes made for soap
Whites on Fifth Avenue
Blues down in Wall Street losing hope..
Big bargain today... Chief take it away!
Come you busted city slickers,
Better take it on the chin
Father Nick has lost his knickers
Give it back to the Indians!

You leave me breathless
You heavenly thing
You look so wonderful
You're like a breath of spring
You leave me speechless
I'm just like the birds
I'm filled with melody
But at a loss for words
That little grin of yours
That funny chin of yours
There's so much to my heart
Or give your lips to me
For darling that would be
The final touch to my heart
You leave me breathless
That's all I can say
I can't say more because
You take my breath away

Life has a crazy pattern
And fortune comes to few
I'd like to take the pattern
And fashion it for you
Though there may be lean while
Darling, in the meanwhile
I'll give you my love
I'm sure that love will see us through
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
If you want the moon
I'll bring the moon right down to you
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
Someday we'll live in a mansion
Out where the pastures are green
But even in a small room
Just a little hall room
You'll be the king
I'll be the queen
So, please, take my heart
Just for a start till dreams come true
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
Someday we'll live in a mansion
Out where the pastures are green
But even in a small room
Just a little hall room
You'll be the king
I'll be the queen
So, please, take my heart
Just for a start till dreams comes true
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

Walking along playing a song
Walk along, starting us off

Walk along, starting us off

How carelessly
You gave me your heart
And carelessly I broke it, sweetheart
I took each tender kiss you gave to me
Every kiss made you a slave to me
Then carelessly
I told you good-bye
But now at night I wake up and cry
I wish I knew a way to find the love
I threw away so carelessly

He's too tough
He's too tough
Check it out
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between
Ah, yeah
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between
(He's too tough)
When I see those big brown eyes
It really knocks me down
I get rubber knees
When he's around
Every time he calls my name
You know I can't resist
It chills me out
Just thinking about his kiss
My, my, my
I keep on coming
One more time
Back to his arms
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between, yeah
(He's too tough)
People say he'll make me
Bite off more than I can chew
But ain't nobody's business
If I do
My, my, my
I keep on coming
One more time
Back to his arms
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between
(In between)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between
(In between)
That's right, baby
I want you right in between
Not too big, not too small
Just right, just right
(Too tough)
He's too tough
(Too tough)
He's too tough
He's just too tough for me, honey
(Too tough)
He's too tough
My, my, my
I keep on coming
One more time
Back to his arms
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)
He's too tough for me
I want him in between
(In between)
He's too tough
He's too tough
He's too tough
He's too tough
The man is too tough
He's too tough
(He's too tough)
He's too tough
He's too tough
He's too tough
(He's too tough)
He's too tough
He's too tough
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
(He's too tough, he's too tough)
(So tough)
Oh, oh

(So tough)
Oh, yeah

Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!
When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, "Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?"
He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.
And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.
By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.
He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.
I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.

Gee, but it's hard to love someone
When that someone don't love you
I'm so disgusted, heartbroken, too
I've got those down-hearted blues
Once I was crazy 'bout a man
He mistreated me all the time
The next man I get has got
To promise to be mine, all mine
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days
It seems that trouble's going to follow me to my grave
I ain't never loved but three men in my life
I ain't never loved but three men in my life
My Father, my brother and the man that wrecked my life
It may be a week, it may be a month or two
It may be a week, it may be a month or two
But the day you quit me honey, it's coming home to you
I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand
I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand
I'm going to hold it until you didn't come under my command

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you
In a far away land
On a tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue
Way up on a mountain
Way down in a valley
I know I'll be happy
Any place anywhere
I don't care
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you
In a far away land
On a tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue
Way up on a mountain
Way down in a valley
I know I'll be happy
Any place anywhere
I don't care
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight

Life is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure
What we do here below
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today

People hand in hand
Future in the plan
Promises we make
Sometimes fade away
Like footprints in the sand
Love`s a game of chance
I`ve come to understand
What my greatest fear is
Someday you`ll disappear
Like footprints in the sand
But life was meant to live
And love was meant to give
No-one ever said
That you could depend
On whispers to the wind
Love`s a game of chance
I`ve come to understand
What my greatest fear is
Someday you`ll disappear
Like footprints in the sand
So I will build my castle on the sea
And pray that you`ll come back to me
And there I`ll wait faithfully
For your return, your return
Love`s a game of chance
I`ve grown to understand
Hope will keep you near
She will reappear
Like footprints in the sand
In the sand, in the sand

Oh how I love him
But he just doesn't see
Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes
Each girl he passes goes
When he walks
He's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when he passes each girl
He passes goes
Ooh but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day
When he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes goes
I smile, but he doesn't see (doesn't see)
He just doesn't see he never sees me

The problem's all inside your head, she said to me
The answer is easy if we take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
She said, it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being rude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Back on the bus, Gus
Don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
She said it grieves me now to see you in such pain
I wish that there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said I appreciate that and now would you please explain
About the, the fifty ways
She said now why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And in the morning, I believe that you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized that she was probably right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
You hop on the bus, Gus
Don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
You hop on the bus, Gus
Don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me

The world keeps on spinning
The world keeps on spinning, yeah
World keeps on spinning
The worlds keeps on spinning, yeah
Hey now, I know you're gonna be okay
Time keeps on changing but I know we're gonna win anyway
Oh, how I've done you wrong, there ain't a thing
That I can say to you to make it better
Sometimes we must be strong, you know
That life goes on for us if we cannot be together
Don't cheat yourself, happiness is 'round the corner
It will come to you, so have faith in future love
'Coz there's heaven up above when we think
We've reached the end the world keeps on spinning
Hey, you know that time can be a healer, so they say
We mustn't be afraid to let our lonely nights become a brand new day
Oh, how I've done you wrong, I couldn't offer you a hope
Or find a better way, this time we must be strong
Our friendship lasts beyond all else, don't let it fade away
Don't let it fade away

Drop me off in Harlem
Any place in Harlem
There's someone waiting there
Who makes it seem like Heaven up in Harlem
I don't want your Dixie
You can keep your Dixie
There's no one down in Dixie
Who can take me 'way from my hot Harlem
Harlem has those southern skies,
They're in my baby's smile,
I idolize my baby's eyes
And classy up-town style
If Harlem moved to China,
I know of nothing finer,
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day
And have them drop me off in Harlem
Harlem has those southern skies,
They're in my baby's smile
I idolize my baby's eyes
And classy up-town style
If Harlem moved to China,
I know of nothing finer,
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day
And have them drop me off in Harlem
If Harlem moved to China
I know nothing finer than to be in Harlem

Been downhearted baby
ever since the day we met
I've been downhearted baby
ever since the day we met
Our love is nothin' but the blues
Baby how blue can you get
My love is like a fire
Your love is like a cigaret
My love is like a fire
But baby yours is like a cigaret
I watch you step down on it baby and crush it
Tell me how, tell me how, how blue can you get
You're evil when I'm with you
and you're jealous when we're apart
Yes you're evil when I'm with you baby
Lord have mercy, you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get
Hey that's a writing in my heart
I gave you a brand new Ford
and you just said I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
You said Thanks for the snack
I let you live in my penthouse
You said it was just a shack
I gave you seven children
and now you wanna give 'em back

I'm choking back the anger
As I'm hanging up the phone
You just called to let me know
You're doing fine
Another civil conversation
I never raised my voice
I just bit my tongue
And swallowed my pride
But as angry as I am
I'll never let you see
'Cause there's always the chance
You'll come back to me
Nobody loves you like I do
It's a lonely life you're living
Though you never would admit
It's not easy loving
More than just one man
You've got lovers at the office
And boyfriends on the coast
And a friend
Who's just a casual thing
The grass is always greener
'Till you reach the other side
You'll search and you'll search
But in time you'll find
That nobody loves you like I do
Nobody, baby
Nobody loves you like I do
I wish you'd tell me where I went wrong
How could you walk out on me?
Now, all I have are these telephone calls
Where I never say exactly how I feel
Nobody loves you like I do
Well, there's never been a moment
Since the day you walked out
That I haven't felt
The pain of losing you
But every time you call me
I just say that I'm alright
I never let the loneliness
Shine through
But if you ever get the feeling
That you want to settle down
Just call out my name and I'll be around
Oh, nobody loves you like I do
Nobody, baby, nobody loves you like I do
Nobody, nobody loves you like I do
No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Nobody can do the the dirt like I do
Nobody, nobody, baby
No, no, no, right, no, no, nobody
Nobody loves you like I do, oh baby
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, baby
Nobody loves you, nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
No, no

We're off on the road to Morocco
This camel is tough on the spine (hit me with a band-aid, Dad)
Where they're going, why we're going, how can we be sure
I'll lay you eight to five that we'll meet Dorothy Lamour
(Yeah, get in line)
Off on the road to Morocco
Hang on till the end of the line (I like your jockey. Quiet)
I hear this country's where they do the dance of the seven veils
We'd tell you more (uh-ah) but we would have the censor on our tails
(Good boy)
We certainly do get around
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound
We're off on the road to Morocco
Well look out, well clear the way, 'cause here we come
Stand by for a concussion
The men eat fire, sleep on nails and saw their wives in half
It seems to me there should be easier ways to get a laugh
(Shall I slip on my big shoes?)
Off on the road to Morocco
Hooray! Well blow a horn, everybody duck
Yeah. It's a green light, come on boys
We may run into villains but we're not afraid to roam
Because we read the story and we end up safe at home (yeah)
Certainly do get around
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound
We certainly do get around
Like a complete set of Shakespeare that you get
In the corner drugstore for a dollar ninety-eight
We're Morocco bound
Or, like a volume of Omar Khayyam that you buy in the
Department store at Christmas time for your cousin Julia
We're Morocco bound
(We could be arrested)

"It's raining on my window,
I need a blue sky,
Longing for the sunshine,
That's really why.
My mood's got the color of the weather outside,
Oh baby,
That is sure hard to hide."
"The weather is changing,
We're changing too,
I've been feeling so lonesome,
My mood's turning blue.
You're the only one that I love baby,
Please won't you stay?
Oh baby
Can you hear, what I say?"
"If I had a Dollar,
For every tear I cried over you,
I'd be a rich man,
Be a rich man,
Crying over you."
"Looking out my window,
This time of the year,
And it calls for a treatment,
Hope the rescue is near.
I'm not the kind of guy to give up,
If things don't go right,
Oh baby,
Can I hold you tonight?"
"If I had a Dollar,
For every tear I cried over you,
I'd be a rich man,
Be a rich man,
Crying over you."
(Guitar-play)
"If I had a Dollar,
For every tear I cried over you,
I'd be a rich man,
Be a rich man,
Crying over you."
"If I had a Dollar,
For every tear I cried over you,
I'd be a rich man,
Be a rich man,
Crying over you."

I trusted in you right from the start
You messed around until you broke my heart
Anytime for you and all the time for me
Someday you're gonna be sorry, the way you treated me
You leave me in the mornin', come home late at night
Well, have a nerve to tell 'em that you treated me right
Anytime for you and all the time for me
Babe, you're gonna be sorry, the way you treated me
You is a liar and a cheater too
The things you do to me is coming home to you
Anytime for you and all the time for me
You gonna be sorry, the way you treated me
Pick 'em, boy, pick 'em, pack up your clothes and get out of my flat
And let my doorknob hit you in your back
Anytime for you and all the time for me
You gonna be sorry, the way you treated me

Go on and sing my heart
You know it's spring my heart
So why not show it?
Pretend you're glad my heart
Although you're sad my heart
He mustn't know it
Remember, love is not an easy game
No two hearts ever beat quite the same
Go on and dance my heart
Our only chance my heart
Is to forget it
Should you despair my heart
He'll know we care my heart
And we'll regret it
If it's to be, we soon shall see
And if it's not to be,
No power on earth can make it so
Pretend it's spring my heart
Go on and sing my heart
For if you sing, he'll never know
(bridge)
Go on and dance my heart
Our only chance my heart
Is to forget it
Should you despair my heart
He'll know we care my heart
And we'll regret it
If it's to be, we soon shall see
And if it's not to be,
No power on earth can make it so
Pretend it's spring my heart
Go on and sing my heart
For if you sing, he'll never know

I once loved a man
Who was all lips and hands,
Cracked lips and hands,
Calloused hands.
I still feel his touch
Against my skin;
Past loves linger like
Phantom limbs
I'll cut straight to the heart:
I don't believe
The pretty little things that you say.
I've heard a lot of little pretty things.
Don't buy me flowers,
It pains me to watch
Pretty little things wilt away
Pretty little things wilt away
Pretty little things wilt away
There are lessons in life
No one should have to learn,
But trust is now something
I make people earn.
So I'm not inclined
To just give it away
To a pair of blue eyes
With some nice things to say
I'll cut straight to the heart:
I don't believe
The pretty little things that you say.
I've heard a lot of little pretty things.
Don't buy me flowers,
It pains me to watch
Pretty little things wilt away
Pretty little things wilt away
Pretty little things wilt away
I know a trick to make a man's color show:
If he sees something he wants,
Tell him no
Maybe you're right,
Maybe I have been used up
By another man's hungry hands.
Maybe you're right,
Maybe I have been ruined
For all other men after him.
But maybe I'm the one who's right.
Maybe you have proven why
Women like me
Never fall for pretty little things
I'll cut straight to the heart:
I don't believe
The pretty little things that you say.
I've heard a lot of little pretty things.
Don't buy me flowers
It pains me to watch
Pretty little things wilt away
Pretty little things wilt away
Pretty little things wilt away

Your magic hands
Your loving eyes
Your kissable lips
Make my heart realize
I'm in love, I'm in love
And I know, it's true
'Cause who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you
Well, I don't know
What you've got
But it's got me
And, baby, I'm hooked
Like a fish in the sea
You make angels call from above
You could make the
Devil fall in love
And who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you
Oh, come on
Let's dance awhile
I wanna talk
I wanna talk to you, child
You've been blessed
And you're much, too much
Well, there's a wonder of a love
In your touch
Now, don't you fret
Ah, doncha worry about me
'Cause I'll never forget
How much you mean to me
I love you, I love you
My whole life through
Tell me, who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you
Let's twist awhile
Ah, don't you ever fret
Ah, don't you worry about me
I'll never forget
How much you mean to me
I love you, I love you
My whole life through
But tell me, who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you

I sail out on my paper ship
The sea is made of fire
I ride my horse of nuts and bolts
We made to never tire
The world is just a simple circle
I've got to keep on turning, yeah
I've got to keep on turning
'Til I fall
Down to the top of a mountain
Inside a hollow stone
I pretend that I'm an iron man, yeah
Instead of flesh and bone
The world is just a simple circle
And it keep on turning, yeah
And it keep on turning
You've got to
Go away
I can't stand to see your face
Cause you've seen the weakest me
And now you know I'm only human
Instead of all the things I'd like to be
The world is just a simple circle
You've got to keep on turning, yeah
You've got to keep on turning
Or down you fall

I met a girl a wonderful girl
Who's really got a lot to recommend her for a girl
Fabulous creature without any doubt
Hey what am I getting so excited about
She's just a girl an everyday girl
And yet I guess she's really rather special for a girl
For once you've seen her the others are not
Hey what am I getting so excited about
But so what what has she got others have not
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those
But when she looks up at me what do I see
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race
Hey I met a girl a marvelous girl
She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl
Found me a treasure and I want to shout
Hey what am I getting so excited about
But so what what has she got others have not
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those
But when she looks up at me what do I see
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race
(I got a girl a marvelous girl)
(She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl)
Found me a treasure and I want to shout
This is what am I getting so excited about
(He met a girl) and I fell in love today

I love you much too much
I've known it from the start
But yet my love is such
I can't control my heart
I love you much too much
I ask myself what for
And darling when we touch
I love you more
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly
But who am I to say
If I should hold it lightly
It might slip away
I love you much too much
You've never really known
I love you oh so much
I'm yours alone
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly
But who am I to say
If I should hold it lightly
It might slip away
I love you much too much
You've never really known
I love you oh so much
I'm yours alone

All my dreams are over; now I'm wide awake
With a lonesome feeling and a constant ache
Livin' with my memories just for old time's sake
Crying my heart out for you
Hope you'll be more tender in your next affair
Trust you'll think of me, dear, when you've time to spare
Praying you'll be happy is my only prayer
Crying my heart out for you
Your heart may ache you, friends may forsake you
Sometimes it happens that way
But I'm still for you, always adore you
I love you, I love you; what more can I say?
I was just a scholar, made for you to teach
Searching for a true love, one I couldn't reach
Now I'm just a pebble on a lonely beach
Crying my heart out for you

I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
With you in my life, there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (to be with you)
Hoping you want me the way that I want to be with you
Deep inside I know you care,Baby for me, you really care
I felt it the first day you came my way
So beautiful, and here we are, baby like the moon and the stars
Together never one without the other
My emotions are in your hands, cause you're my man baby
So take care of me, and I'll understand, that you need a friend
So don't ever worry, don't ever doubt, cause you're all I'm about
I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
With you in my life there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (hoping you want me)
Hoping you want me, the way that I want to be with you
Baby, baby let it be, let your love overpower me
Take me to a place that I've never been, never been before
Somehow this love is out of control
I'm falling for you and I don't want to go
I don't want to go, no, no
Baby I'll go
Don't let me go
My emotions are in your hands
Girl I want to be your man

I understand that you're my friend
No, no need to worry
Don't you ever doubt, cause you're my friend
I love you too
Oh, I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
With you in my life there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (to be with you)
Hoping you want me the way I want to be with you
Cause you're my friend, and I love, I love ,I love you Baby
I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
Realize, realize there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (to be with you)
Hoping you want me the way that I want to be with you
I'd travel any day (to be with you)
Realize how much I care (to be with you)
Realize there's no way I could go wrong (to be with you)
Every night and day I pray (to be with you)
Someway, somehow this love will stay (to be with you)

If you woke and I was gone
from the house we made our home,
Would it bend you, break you,
overtake your heart like it did my own?
And if I were someplace else,
And if I were someplace else,
And if I were someplace else
Would this be easier?
The only peace I have ever known
is the peace I made with you.
I won't move, but I can't stay here,
so what the hell am I supposed to do?
And if I were someone else,
And if I were someone else,
And if I were someone else
Would this be easier?
I try to keep it in my head
The need to leave this empty bed
And be nobody instead
Because it's easier
I'll learn to lie,
I'll learn to grow,
I'll learn to hold it for a while and let it go.
I'll learn to take,
I'll learn to keep -
Please tell me someday I'll at least be able to sleep.
Please tell me someday I'll at least be able to sleep.
And if I were someone else,
And if I were someplace else,
If I were not myself,
Would this be easier?
I'm at a loss for better plans,
'cause this is all that I have,
so I'll just close my eyes and try to pretend
that it gets easier,
that it gets easier,
that it gets easier.

We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight, and we
Would especially like to welcome all the representatives of Illinois'
Law enforcement community that have chosen to join us here in the
Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time. We sincerely hope that you all enjoy
The show and please remember people, that no matter who you are, and
Whatever you do to live, thrive and survive, there are still some
Things that make us all the same:
You, me, him, them -- everybody, people, everybody!
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (Someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you in the morning
I need you, (you) you, you when my soul's on fire
#change: C#m, A, C#m, be
Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide, I need you!
Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide,
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
You know people when you do find somebody, hold that woman, hold that
Man, love him, hold him, squeeze her, please her, hold, squeeze and
Please that person, give 'em all your love, signify your feelings with
Every gentle caress, because it's so important to have that special
Somebody to hold, kiss, miss, squeeze, and please.
Everybody needs somebody

I've posed for pictures with Iv'ry Soap
I've petted stray dogs, and shied clear of dope
My smile is brilliant, my glance is tender
But I'm noted most for my unspoiled gender
I've been made Miss Reingold, though I never touch beer
And I'm the person to whom they say, "You're sweet, my dear,"
The only etchings I've seen have been behind glass
And the closest I've been to a bar is at ballet class
Prim and proper, the girl who's never been cased
I'm tired of being pure and not chased
Like something that seeks it's level
I want to go to the devil
I want to be evil, I want to spit tacks
I want to be evil and cheat at jacks
I want to be wicked, I want to tell lies
I want to be mean and throw mud pies
I want to wake up in the morning
With that dark brown taste
I want to see some dissipation in my face
I want to be evil, I want to be mad
But more than that, I want to be bad
I want to be evil and trump an ace
Just to see my partner's face
I want to be nasty, I want to be cruel
I want to be daring, I want to shoot pool
And in the theater, I want to change my seat
Just so I can step on everybody's feet
I want to be evil, I want to hurt flies
I want to sing songs like the guy who cries
I want to be horrid, I want to drink booze
And whatever I've got, I'm eager to lose
I want to be evil, little evil me
Just as mean and evil as I can be!

The world keeps on spinning
The world keeps on spinning, yeah
World keeps on spinning
The worlds keeps on spinning, yeah
Hey now, I know you're gonna be okay
Time keeps on changing but I know we're gonna win anyway
Oh, how I've done you wrong, there ain't a thing
That I can say to you to make it better
Sometimes we must be strong, you know
That life goes on for us if we cannot be together
Don't cheat yourself, happiness is 'round the corner
It will come to you, so have faith in future love
'Coz there's heaven up above when we think
We've reached the end the world keeps on spinning
Hey, you know that time can be a healer, so they say
We mustn't be afraid to let our lonely nights become a brand new day
Oh, how I've done you wrong, I couldn't offer you a hope
Or find a better way, this time we must be strong
Our friendship lasts beyond all else, don't let it fade away
Don't let it fade away

Honor was not just a word
To knights of old who pledged their faith
In love over gold, love over gold.
Now they laughed at his fantasy world
And maximized all the potentials to earn The middle class was too blind to see
The true nobility of Don Quixote.
Oh, Don Quixote fight your way into their hearts
Commit your hearts all
How unreal are the dragons he slays
Is his coat of arms just an empty clich?
Colossal ignorance shared by the crowd
The brainless bigots cast an inhuman shroud
Many hearts and minds are going to waste
Liberal philosophies you wear like your clothes
The modern hypocrite he don't even know
Who could be proud of this blank generation

They say that Bird was really quite a genius
The way he played the saxophone was unknown
Was truly ahead of his time
Played with a passion that was totally true
Stated in a fashion that was totally new
A master of the rhythm and blues
He would stay our every night and he'd play
He made bop into a language today
Bird really put his soul into his music
Every note that Parker blew was so true
You knew he was talking to you
Now everybody wants to study bird
Play everything he wrote and spread the word
This music really has to be heard
Study Ornithology & you will hear the quality of Bop

Caught in a revolving door and my lungs are suffocating.
Working hard is my reward and my job is so frustrating.
I'm a martyr to myself and a hero to my family. I can feel a breaking point, a longing to be free
But instead I'll hang in there and suffer with the rest. I'm a drunk and a sentimental man
So dust off a bottle of your best Irish whiskey and drink with me to departed friends, To departed Friends
In the middle of the night I wake up, my heart is pounding
I expected more from life than a house and TV watching
'Cause I wimped out on myself, take it out on my friends and family
'Cause they don't appreciate I sacrificed my dreams
Hey there guys I'm not the enemy it's just shared frustration that makes us fight
It's a long way to drive to not make any money, merry Christmas, at least we gotta try

Melancholy me
Melancholy over you
All alone and feelin' blue
Are you melancholy too?
Miss you every day
Ever since you went away
Melancholy over you
Are you melancholy too?
While each minute seems
Like hours to me
Each hour seems like years
Each day is an eternity
Of sadness and tears
All I do is yearn
Though I know you'll soon return
But until you do, I'll be
Just a melancholy me
While each minute seems
Like hours to me
Each hour seems like years
Each day is an eternity
Of sadness and tears
All I do is yearn
Though I know you'll soon return
But until you do, I'll be
Just a melancholy me

Dance, dance, only with me,
Only with me near your heart
Dance, dance, cling close to me,
Never to part!
Love, love, love only me,
All of our days from now on
Dance only with me
'till all our sweet music is gone!

Love, love, love only me,
All of our days from now on
Dance only with me
'till all our sweet music is gone!
. . . 'till all our sweet music is gone!
( Dance with me, only with me! )
from the Broadway Production "Say Darling"
Music by Julie Styne
With lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green

Just take a look at Harlem after sundown,
Any time you choose,
It's hard to find the people feeling run-down;
There's no time for blues.
If you don't know just what to really do
Just take a walk along the avenue,
You'll hear the sounds come a-floatin' through
Along about midnight.
They close the windows and they dim the light
To hide their doings from a stranger's sight,
Everything is going right,
'Long about midnight.
Pianos tinkle, and the couples sway,
Taking the pleasures they find,
They don't care how they live by day,
Why not leave trouble behind?

Be honest with me dear whatever you do
Remember you're mine dear so always be true
Where ever you wander on land or on sea
If you really love me be honest with me
My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear I dream about you
Oh you are my darling you're all that I see
If you really love me be honest with me
Some day I'll return dear kinda make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I'm all alone
But I never forget dear your sweet memory
If you really love me be honest with me

Finally, they've exonerated Dupree
But it cost him his parents, and his wife, his home, his life
In the land of the free
Evidently, five fifths an innocent man but the court only saw three
He spent eleven thousand days locked away
In the land of the free
How can we call our home, the land of the free
Until we've unbound the praying hands
Of each innocent woman and man
In these lands of the

My waiter is a brando affecting nicholson's smile I feel a sort of compassion but choking down my dinner was a trial The sixty-five year old poet, he's still finding his voice I read his old yellow clipping calling him the poor man's shithouse joyce The impossible dream, yes you will find out It's throwing cheap plastic toys in its wake She clutched her precious objects that held no meaning for him His face was a jackal it seemed to her in the dim Transfixed and horrified he watched it snack on some kind of albino cake She stuffed her screeching child into a stroller The impossible dream, yes you will find out Start at the top and live like you're always willing to fall But you know it makes no difference to me This year you'll reinvent yourself and grow Comfortably soft you'll jump over the barbed wire Slow motion in a crashin' car Her halo formed in broken glass And get your giblets torn off Yellow police tape and a blonde wig I guess you went too fast The impossible dream, yes you will find out

Bewildered
Lost in a dream of you
Where is the love I knew
Why did we part?
Bewildered
Helpless without you near
Wishing your heart could hear
What's in my heart
Must I have sleepless nights and endless days?
Oh love why did you leave my soul without a spark?
I'm in the dark
Bewildered
I need your guiding hand
I'll never understand
How you could love me, then leave me
Bewildered

Here you come draggin' in
Three a.m. again
Grinnin' that silly grin
Smellin' just like sin
Holdin' up that alibi that's tissue paper thin
Diggin' down deeper and deeper
In that hole you're already in
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that
You might as well tell the truth
I know you been foolin' around
With some fool from way 'cross town
You're tearin' our good thing down
Makin' me out your clown
Lookin' for excuses that you know can't be found
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that
You might as well tell the truth
You say you was gone with that girl from up the street
But I know better
She called here lookin' for you and she told me
Said you never met her
And you could be more discreet
With your love letters
And honey, I smell some other man
All over your cashmere sweater
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie not better than that
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that
You might as well tell the truth

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home juiced no more
I stop by a fence to visit with a friend of mine
I just dropped in for a minute
But I over stayed my time
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders
Don't you come home drunk no more
Why oh why does whiskey
Make me lose my head
Got me sitting at a bar
When I should be home in bed
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home drunk no more
Yeah whiskey every morning
Whiskey every night
As long as I got my whiskey
Everything's alright
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Don't you come home drunk no more

Goodbye, goodbye to Rome
City of a million moonlit faces
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home

Save the wedding bells for my returnin'
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearnin'
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burnin'
In her heart

When you get right down to it
Isn't this moment what it's all about, girl?
When you get right down to it
Don't you just feel this moment says everything
Holding you, touching you, girl
Need a whole life time to do everything
That I wanna do for you
With you, to you
When you get right down to it
Doesn't this moment wash away the bad times
When you get right down to it
Doesn't all the hurt you ever felt disappear
Holding you, touching you, girl
Know that the magic just can't last forever but then
When you get right down to it
Don't you wanna relive the moment
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again and again
When you get right down to it
When you get right down to it

Hear my heart hear the sound it makes of love
The sound that whispers I love only you
Every beat seems to tell me that we'll meet
Yet I know you're meeting someone new
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost
If it answers yes I'll know it then
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance
Then darling we will be sweethearts again
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost
If it answers yes I'll know it then
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance
Then darling we will be sweethearts again

TURN YOUR LOVE AROUND
George Benson
You've got thelove
You've got the power
But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour
For your love
I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believe in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love
I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you get is lonely
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
Oh, don't you let the lady take it
Away
When all I need's a taste of yesterday
But you stay at home
All they get is lonely
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
Oh girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me
We're gonna make it
We're gonna take it
Back where we belong
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
Turn your love around
This time the girl became a woman
Don't you turn me down
Every woman needs a man
I can show you how
I love the girl, I love the woman
Turn your love around
Turn your love around
This time the girl became a woman
Don't you turn me down
Every woman needs a man
I can show you how
I love the girl, I love the woman
Turn your love around
Turn your love around
This time the girl became a woman
Don't you turn me down
Every woman needs a man
I can show you how
fade out

If you had not've fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
But I patched up your broken wings
And hung around a while
Kept your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away
Cause love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, but I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
If you had not've fallen,
Than I would not've found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
I patched up your broken wings
And hung around a while
Kept your spirits up and your fever down
I know someday that you will fly away
Cause love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, but I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
So fly, fly on past the speed of sound
Oh, rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to and I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
So leave me if you need to and I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
You got paid on Friday
Your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak
Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.
Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
Is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.
Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night

The first time I said goodbye, I thought I'd lost my heaven
And so I came running back to you
And I made a vow to myself, I'd never lose you again
The first time I said goodbye
The first time you broke my heart, I never saw it coming
I was as blind as a fool in love can be, yeah
And I made a vow to myself, you'd never hurt me again
The first time you broke my heart
Hey, wait a minute, baby, I'm always walking out that door, yeah
I stand the pain for a little while and then come running back for more
So this is it, baby, yet another sad farewell
I can't stand to live without you, baby, but living with you is a living hell
The last time I said goodbye, you told me go and good riddance
Knowing that I'd come back to you
But I made a vow to myself, I'd never go back again
The last time I said goodbye
The last time, the last time, the last time
The last time I said goodbye, goodbye

When I get the blues gonna give me a rockin' chair
When I get the blues gonna give me a rockin' chair
When the blues overtake, gonna rock rock away from here
When I get lonesome, I get right on the telephone
Call my baby, and tell her I'm gonna come back home
I say little darling, please have my dinner ready
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say goodbye
Here comes by baby, flashing a new gold tooth
Here comes by baby, flashing a new gold tooth
If she shows more, she can rock home with the bacon too
I've got a Mississippi bullfrog sitting on a hollow stone
I've got a Mississippi bullfrog sitting on a hollow stone
I've got to work for this guy - I don't know which way to turn
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say goodbye

I'm a book on a shelf
Collecting dust all by myself,
But I carry all the words you wrote.
Oh, my spine may be bent,
My binding may be spent,
But there ain't nothin' 'bout you I don't know.
So I know you're not the one.
Use me up and when you're done
Give me back, give me back to the ground.
Give me back, give me back to the ground.
Oh I planted the seeds,
Gave them everything they need.
But the flowers in our window box don't grow.
Little buds make their graves,
As the warmth inside us fades.
But I still don't know shit about letting go.
So I know you're not the one.
Use me up and when you're done
Give me back, give me back to the ground.
Give me back, give me back to the ground.

Chorus
Nicki you're a fake ass low class snake
in the grass an you're blowing it
1st Verse
Another child star caught smoking Salvia
more annoying than Madonna worse than
Carlos Mencia an I hope I'll never see ya
she's really an eyesore attention whore
like "nobody knows how to be a functioning
drug addict anymore" but I shouldn't let it
bug me I'm a druggy I'm chill Hannah
Montana's really going downhill acting like
she got back from Hookahville maybe
somebody gave her another pill you're
blowing it & you have no idea fans question
you like Wiz Kahlifa catch me on Disney
taking bong hits with Miley drug abusin'
& goin' through a phase while losing at
the VMA's people look at you sideways
with the absolute worst review if I'm a
"bad influence" tell me WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
Chorus
2nd Verse
Nobody likes you you're self-centered
you're a bitch I remembered nobody
respects a Kardashian I'd rather party
with OJ Simpson people say you're
worse than Paris Hilton living so grey
always in a state of disarray "you're
blowing it Kanye" quick to cancel like
Iggy you're being a dick like Bill O'Reilly
everybody really hates Nicki what'd I tell
ya you're soundin' like a failure like Iggy
Azelia like you just smoked resin actin' like
Britney in 2007 you were once in 1st place
now you're a stupid bitch like Nancy Grace
SO GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY FACE

I never had a chance
I thought you cared for me
But now I see I never had a chance
I never had a chance
Though you never told me so somehow I know
I never had a chance
I knew we would have to part
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart
My dreams about romance
Ended in a friendly chat but more than that
I never had a chance
My dreams about romance
Ended in a friendly chat but more than that
I never had a chance

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you got
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Lets give love a try (oh, oh, oh)
Sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts of love they find true love
In a special way
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you got
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I got
Your love has captured me
The closer I get to you
The feeling comes over me (me too)
Pulling closer, sweet as the gravity
(The closer I get) to you

HAVE A HEART
(Ken Lane - Irving Taylor)
« © '64 Sands Music »
Have a heart have a heart
Let me warn you before we start
My love's no play-thing no throw-away thing
So have a heart
When I swear how I care
I'm not fooling so please be fair
If you'll be lyin' I will be cryin'
So have a heart
Darling it's the very first time
I've ever fell in love you see
This would be the very worst time
For you to take advantage of me
So I plead please take HEED
Of the treatment my heart will NEED
If you should break it I couldn't take it
So have a heart
(Darling it's the very first time)
I've ever fell in love before
(This would be the very worst time)
For you to take advantage of me
So I plead please take me...

Hey looky here see me grin ear to ear all aglow I'm so bamboozled
(Bamboozled)
Hey look at me walking tall as a tree since I got a lot bamboozled
(Bamboozled)
I kept shying away she kept sighing away
Now suffice it to say that I fought but I'm finally caught
I fly like the birds feel too lovely for words yesiree that's me bamboozled
Out of my whisps but the thrill of it fits like a glove
(Bamboozled bamboozled by you)
Heaven open the door I ain't running no more
I got bamboozled but oh how I love it in love
(la la la la la la la la la bamboozled)
(la la la la la la la la la bamboozled)
I tried taking a stand
She kept taking my hand
That felt wonderful grand
So I fell like a ton I'm a son-of-a-gun
Will you look at me now not a crease on my brow
When we kiss I'm this bamboozled
Sailing right along feeling bright as the song of a dove
She kept playing it smart
Kissed me out of my heart
I got bamboozled (bamboozled bamboozled) (both) but how I love it in love

Now my road has turned to tracks,
Stones to pebbles, see them roll away.
My wandering troubles need not break my back,
Mmm, sorrow is the price I pay.
I sing my sorrows to the morning; I speak them to the night.
You best believe I? ll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right.
Devil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul?
So you know you got to go.
Hurry, to catch the morning.
You got to hurry on now,
In the night.
I would heed my sorrow.
And it knows, won? t be long now?
Hurry.
Now with blind hands, I crawl this lonely place,
As my dry tears fall and roll away.
I can? t see troubles as they dance behind my back,
Ooo, sorrow is my soul to slay.
He stole my sorrows from the morning; he ripped them from the night.
And you best believe I? ll keep singing to make my wrongs so right.
Devil took a pity of my troubles; he holds my tired old soul
So I know I got to go?
Hurry, to catch the morning.
I got to hurry on now,
In the night.
I would heed my sorrow.
Now I know, won? t be long now?
Hurry.

You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then
My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then
Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

The moment I saw him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
Though I dream of him all the while
But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three
How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way
And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door

In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: "My God, that's tough"
"She stood him up"
"No point in us remaining"
"We may as well go home"
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?
Alone again, naturally

Where am I going? Makes no difference to me
Where am I going? It don't matter to me
Yellow leaves fall all around me
In wonderful decay
Shed no tears for dry dead flowers
Let them fall where they may
Where am I going? Makes no difference to me
Where am I going? It don't matter to me
Like a circus ride, spinnin' around
I'm a careless boy
But now I feel all right
To let go and just hang around
She takes Cindy Sherman pictures
And she cuts herself
She says,

Excuse us ladies and gentleman
One, two
You need to pick your afro daddy
Because it's flat on one side
You need to pick your afro daddy
Because it's flat on one side
What are you waiting on
Well if you don't pick your afro
You gonna have one side high, ha, ha
Well, you said you was gonna take me to see Wu-Tang baby
So I braided my hair, well, yes you did
You said you was gonna take me to see Wu-Tang baby
So I braided my hair, yes I did, corn roll and everything baby
Well, you changed your mind and said we wasn't going
But my momma saw you there
Yes she did, check this out, one time
Well I be blowing up your pager daddy
But you never called me back
Well I be putting in 9-1-1 baby
But you never called me back, no, no
See if you don't know how to use that pager daddy
I'm gonna take that hoe back, yes I will

Runnin' down my batt - er- ies
Layin' me out to rest
Knowin' when that is
Five hours
I wake up and de-stress
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole
And these days I just work
I will when I have so much sun
CHORUS:
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Late - ely my energy's just drained away
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime
It's been a loooong day
Such a long day, ...ay, ay
mmm
and while all my contempt
For every...(all my friends say)
I should take in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
innit
My guitar to London town
And the thing that wakes me
when I could sleep instead
Is the thought that to deny?
That I could fall back into bed
Chorus:
And lately, I 've forgotten who I am
Late - ely, my energy's just drained away
And now...my mind....is workin' overtime
It's been a looooooooooooooong day
It's been a long day
Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much
Chorus:
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Sleep too late
My energy's just drained away
And now my mind is workin' overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so loooooooooong

Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
My heart is aching for you, I can't stand it
I need your love, am I so demanding?
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Well I thought about it
you know I'm not playing
You better listen to me
every word I been saying
Hot is cold, what's cold is hot
I' m a little mixed up,
but I'll give it everything I've got
Don't want your money, don't need your car
I'm doing all right, doing all right so far
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I know you told me
that you'd always love me
And I believed it was true
So I saved the best and I'm ready
My love only just for you
Come back here, come back real quick
my body's aching, and my heart is feeling weak
I'll be alright, I'll be OK
Come on baby, listen to what I say
I don't need your money, don't need your car
I'm doing all right, doing all right so far
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now

Do I want to be with you
As the years come and go
Only forever, if you care to know
Would I grant all your wishes
And be proud of the task
Only forever if someone should ask
How long would it take me to be near if you beckoned
Off hand I would figure less than a second
Do you think I'd remember
How you look when you smile
Only forever oh, that's putting it mild
How long would it take me to be near if you beckoned
Off hand I would figure less than a second
Do you think I'd remember
How you look when you smile
Only forever and it's putting it mild

Until you find the one you want to want you
Until you find her eyes constantly haunt you
Until no other lips can ever thrill you
You'll never know the glory of a heart in love
Until you're swept away with an emotion
As high as stars above, as great as the ocean
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you
(Until you find the one
As high as stars above)
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you
(I love you)

Believe me when I tell 'ya I'm nostalgic for that good ol' Atomic Bomb
God knows I miss cross dressin' Annie out there boogieing with Tyrannosaurus Bob
Now it's a cyberdelic world of jet boys and tiger girls
They sold us down the river but the Diamond Light still shimmers from our hearts
Diamond Light
Turn on turn on your light
Diamond Light Boogie sparklin' bright
Shine on shine your light
Sunglass Sam kept you up all night Oh yeah that's right
Bubblegum girls wear their pants too tight
Oh yeah let's go
Let the 21st century roll
Diamond Light
DIAMOND LIGHT
Boogie
They've hit the streets of fire shoved right out of the doorways trippin' out in drag
Here dome the Countess Connie Casserole she's butterflyin' in expensive rags
And then they sniff themselves awake while they do the titty shake
The century is ending it's your last chance to dance to rock 'n roll so come on
Chorus
Shine on Shine on
Boogie

In old Savannah
I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate`s of a southern brand
But here`s what I don`t understand
They`ve got a gal there
A pretty gal there
Who`s colder than an artic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even nice men leave her alone
They call her "hard hearted Hannah"
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah`s heart is tougher
She`s a gal who loves to see men suffer
To tease them and thrill `em
To torture and kill `em
Is her delight they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pourin` water on a drownin` man
She`s hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A
The call her "hard hearted Hannah"
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refridgerating mamas
Brotha she`s a polar bear`s pajamas
To tease them and thrill `em
To torture and kill `em
Is her delight they say
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like travelin` through Alaska in your BVDs
She`s hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A
Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She`s got the right name "the vamp of Savannah"
Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pourin` water on a drownin` man
She`s hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G-A
Spoken: Ooh! She`s sweet as sour milk.

Woke up this morning and I looked around
So disappointed, I laid back down
Oh, what a dream, what a dream
I had last night
Dreamed I held you in my arms
But I'm still waitin' for that day to come
Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night
Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night
Dreamed we were walkin' down the aisle
The organ was playing "Here Comes the Bride"
You looked out at me and you began to smile
When I looked around everybody began to cry
I opened my eyes, you weren't there
All of my happiness just disappeared
Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night
I opened my eyes, you weren't there
All of my happiness just disappeared
Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night
Oh, what a dream
(Oh, what a dream)
What a dream
(Oh, what a dream)
I had last night

Hear my song, Violetta, hear the song that's in my heart.
Please be mine, Violetta, say that we will never part.
Every night I'm dreaming of you,
Every night I want to whisper, "Dear, I love you."
Hear my song, Violetta, hear the song that's in my heart.

A girl went back to Napoli
Because she missed the scenery
The native dances and the charming songs

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you and you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I have given you my heart
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me
You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me
Bei mir bist du schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist du schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist du schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land
I could say "Bella, Bella", even say "Wunderbar"
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, bei mir bist du schon
So kiss me and say you understand
Bei mir bist du schon, you've heard it all before
but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist du schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist du schon, it's such an old refrain
and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand
I could say "Bella, Bella", even say "Wunderbar"
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I could say "Bella, Bella", even say "Wunderbar"
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, bei mir bist du schon
So kiss me and say that you will understand

She was as tender as a rose
She was as soft as snowy down
And from her head down to her toes
She was a dream that hung around
She was as fresh as April
Warm as may
And all the fellas threw their hearts away
But all of her lovin' was Joe?s she was as tender as a rose
I guess that Joe was pretty sick
His feelings went from cold to hot
Her love to him was just a kick
His ego needed her a lot
And when he took her away she wore a smile
Fate crossed its fingers for that lovely child
Cause all of her lovin' was Joe's
She was as tender as a rose
She came back walking all alone
She wasn't gone for very long
She came back with a heart of stone
We knew that everything had gone wrong
And when you ask her why she's out each night
She'll say, "Brother, once I tried to be right
Once all of my loving was Joe's
I was as tender as a rose."
She was as tender as a rose

I'm in love, yes I am
I'm in love, yes I am um!
I'm in love
Hey baby, hey you know I am
In love
Uh, huh you know I am
Friends all wonder
What's come over me
I'm as happy as any girl could be
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love
(Love, love, love)
Believe me I am
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love oh
(Love, love, love)
Yes, I am
Yes, I am
Yes I am
(Love, love, love)
Hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love
And I'm so glad
That it's me who had to change
I'm sproutin' and bloomin'
Like last summer's rose
I'm in love
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love
(Love, love, love)
Oh baby
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love!
(Love, love, love)
In the mornin'
(In, love in, love in, love in, love)
I wake up smilin'
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love!
(Love, love, love)
Smilin' like love
I know where it's at
(In, love in, love in, love in, love)
(Oh I'm in love)
I'm in love
(In, love in, love in, love)
I'm in love
(In, love in, love in, love in, love)
Yes I am!
(Love, love, love)
I'm in love

In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company
Everything's o.k.
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong
In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give
Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone
(scat)
In a mellow tone
In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company
Everything's o.k.
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong
In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give
Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone
In a mellow tone
In a mellow tone

Open up the sky
'Cause I'm coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let 'em bring me to you
You know I'm standing at the station, ready to go
Oh, big ol' aeroplane, I'm trusting you so
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird
'Cause I got to make it
Just get on up
'Cause I got to make it
Get on up
With me down here
And you up there
Now all we know is
It ain't no fair
'Cause I got love packed in my baggage
Holdin' my claim check
Gonna be with, my baby
And never comin' back
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, up, up
Just get on up
Open up the sky
'Cause I'm coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let 'em bring me to you
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird
'Cause I got to make it
Just get on up
'Cause I got to make it
Get on up
Get on up big bird
Get on up big bird
Get on up big bird
Get on up big bird

You stare at him at night and think of schemes
I stay with her each night but you're in my dreams
You tellin' him that you're goin' out just to meet some friends
I wonder if this treachery will ever ever end
We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair
You have a little boy, you really love
I have a little daughter that I place no one above
If by chance you see me walkin down the street
You know that eyes like ours should never ever meet
We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair
Just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair
Hang ups cause a slip of tongue
Let that make us come undone
Little white lies we tell our friends
Hold our love until the end
We never seem to quit the lies
We live inside a crimson sky
We love each other in our mind
An answer is what we must find
We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair

I went balling the other night
I started drinking and got real tight
I blew each and all my friends
I felt so good I had to blow it again
I said Hey bartender
Hey man, looka here
A draw one, draw two, draw three, four glasses of beer
Well I saw a chick sitting on the end
I said Baby can't we be friends
You're looking sweet as you can be
Well come on down and drink with me
I said Hey bartender
Hey man looka here
Draw one, draw two, draw three, four glasses of beer
Elwood!
Well we was having so much fun
I didn't know it was half past one
I turned around to have on more
I looked at the clock and it was half past four
Hey bartender
Hey man look a here
A draw one, draw two, draw three, four glasses of beer
Well jukebox girl is everything
All the cats began to sing
I heard somebody called and said
Last round for alcohol
I said Hey bartender
Hey bartender
Hey bartender
Hey bartender
Draw one, two, three, four glasses of beer

(Breezy)

levitate I'll be smoking until my whole bag
is empty but I have plenty lite up it's 420...

Fall in love, tall in love
Says my heart,
It's romance, take a chance
Says my heart
But each time that I'm almost in your arms
This old schoolteacher brain of mine
Keeps bringing in false alarms
Then my head rolls instead and I'm wise
To the scheme of that gleam in your eyes
So I kiss and run
But the moment we're apart
"Oh! you fool, that was love"
Says my heart
Then my head rolls instead and I'm wise
To the scheme of that gleam in your eyes
So I kiss and run
But the moment we're apart
"Oh! you fool, that was love"
Says my heart.
It wasn't the moon, it wasn't the stars
"That was love!"
Says my heart

Way down upon the Swanee river
Far far away
Swanee how I love you how I love you
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be among the folks of D-I-X
I even know my mammy's waiting for me, praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to my Swanee shore
Mammy's waiting for me, praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore

I'm not crying
No, not this time
I've swallowed my pride
Behind my tears
I'm in a better place
And when tomorrow comes
It'll be a new day
I'm trying, crying, defining me
An intended purpose, I will lead
Happy within my skin
So I can breathe
I'm not crying
No, not this time
I've swallowed my pride
Behind my tears
I'm in a better place
And when tomorrow comes
It'll be a new day
Each step I take I stride, with pride
One day I take in time, it'll be a new day
I'm wanting, needing, defying
The negativity held inside
Hiding the pain of regret
Inflicted doubt of reality
Weighing down the hardship
Of a broken love
I'm not crying
No, not this time
I've swallowed my pride
Behind my tears
I'm in a better place
And when tomorrow comes
It'll be a new day
But no, not this time
You won't break me
Hiding pain with a smile
Laughing loudly, I stand tall
Shunning doubt with great pride
For being me
One day at a time
It'll be a new day
Brighter days ahead
A new script I'll write
Unknowing of
What tomorrow brings
And when tomorrow comes
I'll be better

I love you a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck
A hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap
A barrel and a heap and I'm talkin' in my sleep
About you, about you
'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck I do
A doodle oodle oh
A doodle oodle oodle oh doo
I love you a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck though you make my heart a wreck
Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess
Make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness
About you, about you
'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck I do
A doodle oodle ooh doo
A doodle oodle oodle ooh doo
I love you a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and it beats me all to heck
It beats me all to heck, how I'll never tend the farm
Never tend the farm when I wanna keep my arm
About you, about you
'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck I do
A doodle oodle ooh
A doodle oodle oodle oh doo
A doodle oodle oodle oh doo
A doodle oodle ooh doo doo

Some people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink wine, leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine
I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue
I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their wine
So if you refuse me my poor heart will pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live dear you'll still hear me cry
I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue
Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue

Wandering star
Wandering star
I was born under a wandering star
I was born under a wandering star
Wandering star
Wandering star

In the dark
It's just you and I
Not a sound
Ther's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark
Now, in the dark, in the dark
I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips
Upon my lips
And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark
But soon
This dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun
Fun to be kissed
In the dark
Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
Lord, in the dark

The bells are ringing for me and my gal.
The birds are singing for me and my gal.
Ev'rybody's been knowing to a wedding they're going.
And for weeks they've been sewing every Suzie and Sal.
They're congregating for me and my gal.
The parson's waiting for me and my gal.
And sometime I'm gonna build a little home for two for three or four or more
In love land, for me and my gal.

Well I heard about the fellow you've been dancin' with All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby?
Didn't you think I could?
Well I know that the boogaloo is outta sight
But to shake a leisure thing tonight
Would it happen to me and you baby?
I want to show you how to do it right...
Do it right. Uh huh. Do it right. Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it right!
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !
[Chorus]
Twist it! Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it baby! Here we go loop di loo!
Shake it out baby!
Here we go loop di lie!

If ever you need warm fan affection love and protection turn to me
If ever you want someone who's tender darling remember turn to me
Whenever you find the life's got you down I'll be around
Any time night or day I'm only your phone call away
I waited for you a half of my lifetime but I'll wait a lifetime
If that's how it must be till you turn to me
(If ever you need warm fan affection love and protection) turn to me
(If ever you want someone who's tender darling remember) turn to me
Whenever you find the life's got you down

I watch
The snow flakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snow
Flakes too
I take a walk downtown
To where
You used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's
Waiting there
Is just
[Chorus]
A little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta
Sad n' lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away
And left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
I hear the Christmas bell
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer
That only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a little prayer
You'll be
Waiting there for me
I look but all I see
Is just
[Chorus]
This is the season of love
But I'm as sad as I can be
Why did you have to leave me
Oh
[Chorus]

The Riviera
On every street a gay casino
Where continentals sip their vino
And leave their fortunes to chance
The Riviera
Where matrons draped in Paris fashions
Prolong the twilight of their passions
In mad pursuit of romance
Every gay mademoiselle
Is disarming some Maharajah
With the daring of her [Incomprehensible]
Life is so completely zany and free
By the Mediterranean sea
Ah, the Riviera
Where every golden coat of sun tan
Has cost the gold of more than one man
Who wasn't warned in advance
He may take to his heart
All the wonders of France
Then as a token for the dough that he's sunk
He gets a little label slapped on his trunk
The Riviera
The Riviera
On every street a gay casino
Where continentals sip their vino
And leave their fortunes to chance
The Riviera
Where matrons draped in Paris fashions
Prolong the twilight of their passions
In mad pursuit of romance
Every gay mademoiselle
Is disarming some Maharajah
With the daring of her [Incomprehensible]
Life is so completely zany and free
By the Mediterranean sea
Ah, The Riviera
Where every golden coat of sun tan
Has cost the gold of more than one man
Who wasn't warned in advance
He may take to his heart
All the wonders of France
Then as a token for the dough that he's sunk
He gets a little label slapped on his trunk
The Riviera

Tell me his name
I want to know
The way he looks
And where you go
I need to see his face
I need to understand
Why you and I came to an end
Tell me again
I want to hear
Who broke my faith in all these years
Who lays with you at night
When I'm here all alone
Remembering when I was your own
[Chorus]
I'll let you go
I'll let you fly
Why do I keep on asking why
I'll let you go
Now that I found
A way to keep somehow
More than a broken vow
Tell me the words I never said
Show me the tears you never shed
Give me the touch
That one you promised to be mine
Or has it vanished for all time
[Chorus]
I close my eyes
And dream of you and I
And then I realize
There's more to life than only bitterness and lies
I close my eyes
I'd give away my soul
To hold you once again
And never let those moments end
[Chorus]

I just got an invitation through the mails
"Your presence requested this evening
It's formal, a top hat, a white tie and tails"
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat and white tie and tails
I'm puttin' on my top hat
Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails
I'm dudin' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails
I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere
That simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust
When I step on the gas
For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails
I'm puttin' on my top hat
Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails
I'm dudin' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails
I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere
That simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust
When I step on the gas
For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails

Oh blessed town
Of Bethlehem
Within thy gray
Green shade
Ringed round
With
Terraced vineyard
And depth
Of olive glade
There on thy high
Green pastures
The shepherds
Watch their sheep
The low large moon
Shines glim'ring
O'er all
The upland steep
What music
Of the heavens
What magic song
Of bliss
What vision
Of the night-tide
What mystic light
Is this?
The silly sheep
Are blinded
The shepherds
In amaze
Stand awe-struck
All the hillside
With glory
Is abaze
The angels'
Joyous
Rings out
Into the night
Oh Gloria
In excelsis
Sing praises
In the height
Sing praises
Men of Bethlehem
Sing praises
Here below
For peace
On Earth
And goodwill
He doth
On your bestow
For on this day
Is born there
Within
Your little town
A Child
Who Christ
The Lord is
Yet wears
No earthly crown
He bringeth joy
And gladness
To you
And all mankind
Yea
Peace on earth
And good-will
To men
Of equal mind
Oh blessed town
Of Bethlehem
How happy
Is thy state
How blest
Above all palaces
The stable
At thy gate
For there
In manger-cradle
(Oh true the angel word)
As King enthroned
Of all the worlds
Reigns Jesus Christ
The Lord

I'm just a small town guy with a handful of dreams
My future seems bright or that's how it seems
When it comes to love I'm in need of advice
I'm in need of advice
I've got it all figured out I've got the world on a string
But baby there's really only one thing
When it comes to love I'm in need of advice
I'm in need of advice, that's right now
But when I look to the sky
I nearly die thinking about how it should be
But that's just me
And I'll always be alone with my misery
It's like a long, cold walk on a winter beach
Love is a game you cannot teach when it comes to love
I'm in love with you and I need some advice
'Cause I'm in love with you and I need some advice, yeah
But when I look to the sky
I nearly die thinking about how it should be
But that's just me
And I'll always be alone with my misery
It's like a long, cold walk on a winter beach
Love is a game you cannot teach when it comes to love
I'm in love with you and I need some advice
Yes I'm in love with you and I need some advice, yeah
All right boys help me out now, come on
Well I'm in love with you and I need some advice
Yes I'm in love with you and I need some advice

I could make you care if only you'd let me,
I could make you care, you'd never forget me,
I can't resist, I'd be a fool to try,
I know if once we kissed, I could kiss my heart goodbye.
I knew this was love the moment I found you,
So I planned my life, it's built all around you,
Give me this chance, darling if you only would,
I could make you care, I know I could.

A Beautiful Friendship Lyrics
This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
It ended a moment ago.
This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
I know,
'Cause your eyes told me so.
We've always been
Like sister and brother,
Until tonight,
When we looked at each other.
That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love.
~interlude~
That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love!

Ando tanto tempo a perguntar
Porque esperar tanto assim de alguém
Percorrendo espaços no mesmo lugar
Não sei a quanto tempo estou a te buscar
Num segundo eu vou
Sabendo e percebendo o seu sabor
Sem ter medo estou
Correndo contra o vento sem nunhum rancôr
Ando tanto tempo a perguntar
Porque esperar tanto assim de alguém
Sem saber
Sem qualquer medo de vêr
So long
I've been wondering for so long
Why to expect so much from someone
Running through spaces in the same place
I've been searching for you a long long time
I am gone in a second
Knowing and learning your taste
Fearless I am
Running against the wind, holding no grudges
I've been wondering for so long
Why to expect so much from someone
Without knowing
Without any fear to see

If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl
There's none so classy
As this fair lassie, oh, oh
Holy Moses, what a chassis
We went riding, she didn't balk
Back from Yonkers
I'm the one that had to walk
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl
She wears long tresses
And nice tight dresses, oh, oh
What a future she possesses
Out in public, how she can yawn?
In a parlor you would think
The war was on

I want to thank your folks
For making you as sweet as you are,
How else can I express how I feel,
Assess and reveal all my love?
I want to thank your folks
For making you the dream that you are,
And tell them what a swell job they've done
Of raising the one I love.
Do you recall the birthday party they gave you
When we were just a couple of kids?
Well suppose they haven't thought of inviting me too,
See what I'd have missed?
And here's my thanks to you
For making all my love dreams come true.
But darling, to be perfectly frank,
I really must thank your folks.
And here's my thanks to you
For making all my love dreams come true.
But darling, to be perfectly frank,
I really must thank your folks.

Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him
Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
And when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Lord above me, make him love me
The way he should
I got it bad
And that ain't good

When the sun goes down the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey hey Uncle Dud it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
What a dance do they do
Lordy how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mud
Lordy how they play it
Goodness how they sway it
Uncle Joe, Uncle Jim
How they pound the mire with vigor and vim
Joy the music thrills me
Boy it nearly kills me
What a show when they go
Say they beat up either fast or slow
When the sun goes down the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Say hey Uncle Dud it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
What a dance do they do
Lordy how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mud
When the sun goes down the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey hey Uncle Dud it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
What a dance do they do
Lordy how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet
When the people beat their feet
When the people beat their feet
On the Mississippi mud

Chorus: Diamonds and Pearls
Since you went away boy
I been slowly dying, dying
No, no no
I been slowly dying, dying
It is drivin, slowly tryin
drivin me insane
don't Go
rapid thoughts
in my mind
chasing images
dancing effortlessly
across a blank page.
creatively I freely
sketch words
borrowed in time.
Word patterns
illuminate
space and time.
on a sheet
freely singing
notes of
spoken words.
Crying notes
Of rythem and rhyme
Flowing freeeeely.
since Prince went away
got time on my hands
ain't got no plans.
I'm trying, slowly dying
the blues
No, no, no, no more.
No, no, no more
Slowly dying
fighting
from going insane
Diamonds and Pearls
Boy and a girl
diamonds and pearls
Boy meets girl
Since you been away
A tribute to Prince Roger Nelson

They all walked away, nothing to say
They'd just lost their dearest friend
All that He said, now He was dead
So this was the way it would end
The dreams they had dreamed were not what they'd seemed
Now that He was dead and gone
The garden, the jail, the hammer, the nail
How could a night be so long?
Then came the morning
Night turned into day
The stone was rolled away
Hope rose with the dawn
Then came the morning
Shadows vanished before the sun
Death had lost and life had won
For morning had come
The angel, the star, the kings from afar
The wedding, the water, the wine
Now it was done, they'd taken her Son
Wasted before His time
She knew it was true, she'd watched Him die too
She'd heard them call Him just a man
But deep in her heart she knew from the start
Somehow her Son would live again
Then came the morning
Night turned into day
The stone was rolled away
Hope rose with the dawn
Then came the morning
Shadows vanished before the sun
Death had lost and life had won
For morning had come
Then came the morning
Shadows vanished before the sun
Death had lost and life had won
For morning had come
For morning had come

In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it,
You'll be the grandest lady in the Easter Parade.
I'll be all in clover and when they look you over,
I'll be the proudest fellow in the Easter Parade.
On the avenue, Fifth Avenue, the photographers will snap us,
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet,
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter Parade.

No one's ever held me like you hold me
No one's ever touched me in this way
But I'm not runnin' anymore
Never felt this way before
[Chorus]
All of my love I will give to you
All of my dreams will be comin' true
In the heat of a tangled kiss
Say you will and I promise you this
All of my love I will give to you
All that I ask is you love me too
Take a look, I'm never far behind
Turn around and gimme gimme gimme a sign
I will put my feelings into one place
Center my emotions on your face
I could spend a lifetime sharin' night time
'Cause when you're lyin close to me
Somethin' tells me that you need
[Chorus]
So, be my lover, be my friend
Say this love will never end
Want no other in my life
Our forever starts tonight
All of my love
Oh yes
[Chorus]

He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband
Last night I went out drinking
When I came home I gave her a beating
So she ? the rolling pin and went to work on my head
Until she bash it in
I lie cold dead in the market
Stone cold dead in the market
I lie cold dead in the market
She killed nobody but her husband
I lick 'im wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
I lick 'im wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
I lick 'im wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
And if I kill him, he had it coming
Man,
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband
My family they're swearin' to kill her
My family they're swearin' to kill her
His family they're swearin' to kill me
And if I kill him, he had it coming
Here I lie cold dead in the market
Cold dead in the market
I lie cold dead in the market
She kill nobody but her husband
There is one thing that I am sure
He ain't goin' to beat me no more
So I tell ya that I doesn't care
If I was to die in the electric chair
Man
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband
Hey child, I'm coming back and bash your head one more time
No, no no man you can't do that
He's stone cold dead in the market (murderer)
He's stone cold dead in the market (da criminal)
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband

I have dreamed that your arms are lovely
And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper
When you're close, close to me
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you
[instrumental]
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you

Just got back from Paris France
All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy
Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French
Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French
The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink
And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris
Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly
Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire
The poor people of Paris
So don't go to Paris France
Not unless you like to dance
Not unless you want romance
Like those poor inhabitants of Paris
[Spoken]
In the meantime, I got to hurry back there
I think I forgot something...

Copper comes from Arizona
Peaches come from Georgia
And lobsters come from Maine
The wheat fields are the sweet fields of Nebraska
And Kansas gets bonanzas from the grain
Old whiskey comes from old Kentucky
Ain't the country lucky
New Jersey gives us glue
And you, you come from Rhode Island
And little old Rhode Island is famous for you
Cotton comes from Louisiana
Gophers from Montana
And spuds from Idaho
They plow land in the cow land of Missouri
Where most beef meant for roast beef seems to grow
Grand canyons come from Colorado
Gold comes from Nevada
Divorces also do
And you, you come from Rhode Island
Little old Rhode Island is famous for you
Pencils come from Pennsylvania
Vest from Vest Virginia
And Tents from Tennessee
They know mink where they grow mink in Wyo mink
A camp chair in New Hampshire, that's for me
And minnows come Minnesota
Coats come from Dakota
But why should you be blue
For you, you come from Rhode Island
Don't let them ride Rhode Island
It's famous for you

You're who I desire, you light my fire
With every kiss, you take me higher
Feeling like your lovin' I just cannot resist
There's something that's makin' me hold on
There's no one I'd rather share my good lovin' with
But I promised I'd wait till I'm ready for this
One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way
I love your touch; it makes me crumble
I'm in love so much; look what you've done
Please, don't whisper anything else in my ear
My body, my heart, and my soul is high
Let me find the strength to get on up outta here
'Cause, one day, the way we feel will be all right
One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way
I love you, no doubt about it
I won't change my mind
Love's so true
If I had my way
I will make love to you
One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way
One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way

If was your summer
If i was your winter
If i was your springtime
If i was your fall
If i was your wind
If i was your stars
If i was your sun
It would never rain at all
If i was your lady
If i was your baby
If i was your sweetheart
If i was your boo
If i was your lover
significant other
if i was your up
I stay down for you
I think I love you
If i was your teacher
If i was your notebook
I i was your pen
I would give you an A
If i was your cellphone
if i was your minutes
If i was your bill
You would never have to pay
If i was your college
if i was your knowledge
if i was your loan
I would be your degree
if i was your ticket
If i was your suitcase
if i was your plane
your destination would be me
I think I love you
Pretty brown skin from way back when
hey boy what you looking at no need to pretend
tell me where you wanna go
we can go back and forth fast or slow
tell me how you like it
Can we go way back
way back in time
flashback to the night when you were mine
shot of belvdere, two bottles of wine
and a slow jam made our bodies align
like a eclipse you keep blocking
like a remix ima keep rocking
listen let me make it clear
what you're looking for is standing right here
right here right here
you over there you you you right in that chair (x2)
I think I love you

Down in Louisiana
There's a grand piano playing man
He knows that they can't kid him
'Cause he's got hot rhythm in his hand
The blues that he'll compose will thrill you
From your head to your toes
He called his song, black rhythm
'Cause his black hands did it 'neath the moon
The keys he plays on sweetly
And you're left completely in a swoon
The melancholy strum
Mixed with the rum-tum of melodious blues
When he plays the blue note
And adds a new note
You'll think that he wrote a symphony
But he's just improvising
On a southern mammy melody
You'll quit your pouting
And start a-shouting
No need in doubting he knows the keys
He can lay on the white ones
Can play on the black ones with ease
The way he plays, black rhythm
Makes the gang stick with him all night long
Forget the hour is late
They hear him syncopate his mournful song
A-humming like the breeze
A-strumming lightly on those ivories

We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say
You have stolen her heart
Now don't go 'way
As we sang love's old sweet song on Moonlight Bay
We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say
You have stolen her heart
Now don't go 'way
As we sang love's old sweet song on Moonlight Bay
We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say
You have stolen her heart (you have stolen her heart)
Now don't go 'way
As we sang love's old sweet song on Moonlight Bay
(Sailing through the moonlight on Moonlight Bay)

How little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover
How little we understand, what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion, when two tingles intermingle
Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is
So long as you kiss me, (and) the world around us shatters
How little it matters, how little we know
(How little we know, how little we know)

If you see me comin', baby, lift your window high
If you see me comin', lift your window high
And if you see me going, hang your head and cry
You've got a wail, got to roll all nite long
Got to move, got to rock all nite long
Got to roll, got to reel-a all nite long
Got to reel like you feel-a all nite long
Got to love me, pretty baby, till the sun comes up at dawn
Baby, you're so beautiful but you're gonna cry one day
I said, "You're so beautiful but you're gonna cry one day"
You're gonna feel so bad for-a treating me this way-a
You've got a wail got to roll all nite long
Got to move, got to rock all nite long
Got to roll, got to reel-a all nite long
Got to reel what you feel-a all nite long
Got to love me pretty, baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
Forget your blues, let your love come tumbling down
Forget your blues, let your love come tumbling down, down
Have you heard the news, big loving Daddy's in town?
You got to roll, got to rock all nite long
Got to move, got to wail-a all nite long
Got to roll, got to reel-a all nite long
Got to reel like you feel all nite long
Got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
You've got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
You've got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn
You've got to love me pretty baby
Till the sun comes up at dawn

If ever you love again, if such luck could be
You must fall in love again with nobody but me
For now that I see you
I know that we should have met long ago
Where have you been?
I wanna know where have you been?
My life was a loosing fight till the lucky night
Baby, you happened in
From what I had heard about love
I thought it was all sorrow and sin
But now that we meet at last, I forget what's past
Baby, where have you been?
I was a fool un-befriended
In the debts of despair
When out of the blue you descended
And somehow ended every care
So if you will give me a break
And all of the love seem to begin
So close to your side I'll stay, you will never say
"Baby, where have you been?"
I was a fool un-befriended
In the debts of despair
When out of the blue you descended
And somehow ended every care
So if you will give me a break
And all of the love seem to begin
So close to your side I'll stay, you will never say
"Baby, where have you been?"

Who were you before you were?
Before the sweets passed through your teeth
Before the games you learnt weren't there
Before your mama would soap up your hair
Where did you learn to snatch those toys
And tell me where did you learn to make that noise
Screaming seemed to get you far
Spitting your dummy out of your cart
Living the life of a dreamer
Do you know what it means, do you know what it means
Living the life of a dreamer
Do you know what it means, do you know what it means
Greedy greedy greedy, take take take
Then its kissy smiley, fake fake fake, Like a cake
A, BC, DEF greedy, do you think that you can change
Up yourself, so you can stand on your friends heads, I said
Chocolate's on the pillows are complimentary
That's what I said, on the fence!
Living the life of a dreamer
Do you know what it means, do you know what it means
Living the life of a dreamer
Do you know what it means, do you know what it means
Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer, dreamer
Living the life of a dreamer
Do you know what it means, do you know what it means
Living the life of a dreamer
Do you know what it means, do you know what it means
Like my friend Icarus, went and melted off his wings
Like a fallen fallen angel lifts his heavy weights before
he sings
That bitch that cut off Samson's hair
It ain't nice, and it sure ain't fair
Now everybody, so play fair, we are the same, we are the
same
As everybody, so play fair, we are the same, we are the
same
Who were you before you were
Before the sweets passed through your teeth
Before the games you learnt weren't there
Before your mama would soap up your hair
Where did you learn to snatch those toys
where did you learn to make that noise
Screaming seem to get you far
Spitting that dummy filling your cart
Living the life of a dreamer
Your living the life do you know what it means
Your living the life of a dreamer
Your living the life do you know what it means
Your living the life of a dreamer
Its not what it seems

I'm a family man
I wasn't born to roam
But it seems like every Christmas time
It takes me farther from my home
I love singin' my song, but it get's me down
To hang my stockin' in some hotel
When the fat man comes to town
But, it's alright, it's gonna to be okay
This year I'll be home come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama, I'm gonna find a way
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
Way up in the bayou there won't be snow
But my friends all envite me 'round
For a Christmas fay do-do
I'm gonna hop a plane or use my thumb
But you best believe I'll be 'round that tree
When Christmas morning comes
Oh, it's alright, it's gonna to be okay
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
But, it's alright (alright)
It's gonna be okay (gonna be okay)
I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama (mama), I'm gonna find a way (gonna find a way)
Yeah, I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day
It's gonna be alright (alright)
It's gonna be okay (gonna be okay)
I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama (mama), I'm gonna find a way (gonna find a way)
Yeah, I'll be home (I'll be home)
For the Louisiana Christmas day

Mopping up soda pop rickeys
To our heart's delight
Dancing to swingeroo quickies
Jukebox Saturday night
Goodman and Kyser and Miller
Help to make things bright
Mixing hot licks with vanilla
Jukebox Saturday night
They put nothing past us
Me and honey lamb
Making one Coke last us
Till it's time to scram
Money we really don't need bad
We make out alright
Letting the other guy feed that
Jukebox Saturday night
After sipping a soda we got a scheme
Somebody else plays the record machine
It's so easy to say pet names
When you listen to the trumpet of Harry James...
We love to hear that tenor croon
Whenever the Ink Spots sing a tune...
If I didn't know why the roses grow
Then I wouldn't know why the roses grow...
Now listen, honey child
If I didn't know all them little things I'm supposed to know
Then I sure would be a sad man
If I didn't know...
Money we really don't need it
We make out alright
Letting the other guy feed that
Jukebox Saturday night

So, when it rains, I'll shield your head
And when you cry, I'll wipe those tears
Because it's you through all these years
And I'm still in love with you
Drop to my knees at Christmas time
And ask you please, if you'd be mine
Because it's you, through all these years
And I'm still in love with you
We walked the streets of the Crescent city
We held hands in China town
We watched the sun go down on the ocean blue
That's when I knew that I would always love you
So when the day turns into night
I know that every thing's all right
Because it's you, through all these years
And I'm still in love with you
We walked the streets of the Crescent city
We held hands in China town
We watched the sun go down on the ocean blue
That's when I knew that I would always love you
So when the day turns into night
I know that every thing's all right
Because it's you, through all these years
And I'm still in love with you
Yes, I'm still in love with you
Yes, I'm still in love with you
(Yes)
Yes, I'm still in love with you
Yes, I'm still in love with you
Yes, I'm still in love with you

Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair
Tragedy just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair
Right from the start
You took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true
So I'll make a vow, make a vow
No more to love's line will I bow
I cross my heart and feel it now
This is my last affair

It's too bad, things are going so tuff with me
It's too bad, things are going so tuff with me
I'm blue and disgusted as any poor man could be
I used to have a car and it was painted white an black
I used to have a car and he was painted white an black
I couldn't keep up the payments and the man, he took it back
I used to smoke cigars the very best in town
But bad luck an trouble is bound to tear me down
It's too bad, things are going so tuff with me
I guess I go back to my plow and start hollerin'
(Whoa, haw, gee)
Play 'em for me boy, play 'em for me
You know my gal quit me
I'm sho' in hard luck
Get it and get it good, now
Yes, I know
I have so much trouble
The women that I'm lovin' is followed me all around
I can tell by her action, she 'bout to put me down
It's too bad, things are goin' so tuff with me
You have heard my story, peoples, what'ch you think a me?
Whoa, haw, gee
Mules and horses, whoa, stop
Haw, go left, gee, go right

The whole world is singing my song
But I sing it only to you
The whole world is humming along
I love you, I love you, I do
You put my dreams to music
I learned how a song could start
I gave the world the music
But I gave you my heart
The whole world is singing my song
But I'll always sing it to you

Well I put the feeling off for so long
I couldnt bare to see you moving on
Cause nobody else can have you
You told me what I gave was not enough
And the dumbing down of love has made you numb
You say that you dont feel anything at all
Well now youre gonna feel it in your heart
Like a bullet in your chest
I thought itd be best
To lay us to rest
And now a smoking gun
Is all that stands between us
I tried to make, you understand
Now theres blood, on my hands
Now Im on the run,
And my demons wont release me
I couldnt be, a fool for love
I had to go, and end it all
With a smoking gun
Now a kiss it never made you think straight
And a bullet carries so much more weight
And if were gonna be over, youre gonna be over
Ill plead insanity, a jealous mans reprise
Before they come and take me, make pay for all my sins
Yeah youre gonna feel me in your heart
Like a bullet in your chest
So I thought itd be best
To lay us to rest
And now a smoking gun
Is all that stands between us
I tried to make, you understand
Now theres blood, on my hands
Now Im on the run,
And my demons wont release me
I couldnt be, a fool for love
I had to go, and end it all
With a smoking gun
Youre gonna feel me in your heart
Like a bullet in your chest
So I thought itd be best
To lay us to rest
And now a smoking gun
Is all that stands between us
I tried to make, you understand
Now theres blood, on my hands
Now Im on the run,
And my demons wont release me
I couldnt be, a fool for love
I had to go, and end it all
With a smoking gun
If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over
If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over
If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over

He's lazy, but he's lovable, we know him like a book
Anytime he can't be found, we know just where to look:
Gone fishin', there's a sign upon his door
Gone fishin', he ain't workin' anymore
There's his hoe out in the sun where he left a row half done
He said "hoein' ain't no fun", he ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool
I'm wishin' I could be that kinda fool
I'd say no more work for mine on my door I'd hang a sign
Gone fishin' Instead of just a wishin'
Gone fishin'. . .see him snoozin' by a brook
Gone fishin'. . .didn't even bait his hook
There's his hound dog by his side fleas are bitin' at his hide
He won't scratch 'em he's to tired he ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin'. . .learnin' fishin' worms to swim
I'm wishin. . .he wuz me and I wuz him
Wish I had a plane to fly here's what I'd write in the sky
Gone' fishin'. . .instead of jest awishin'
Gone fishin'. . . he don't worry 'bout no wars
Gone fishin'. . .left his wife to do the chores
Cows need milkin' in the barn but he jest don't give a darn
See his fishin' pole is gone he's on a secret mission
Gone fishin'. . .out where peace has never died
I'm wishin'. . .all the world was by his side
Then our guns we'd throw away grab a fishin' pole and say

I've been blue all day, my man's gone away
He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told
I tried to treat him kind, I thought he would be mine
That man I hate to lose, that's why mama's got the blues
The man I love he has done left this town
The man I love he has done left this town
And if it keeps on snowing, I will be Gulf Coast bound
The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news
The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news
I'll tell the world he left me with those Gulf Coast blues
Some of you men sure do make me tired
Some of you men sure do make me tired
You've got a mouthful of "gimme", a handful of "much oblige"

Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I say: hello satan
I believe, it's time to go
Me and the devil
Walking side by side
Me and the devil
Walking side by side
And I'm gonna see my woman
'til I get satisfied
See see, you don't see why
Like you'a dog me 'round
Say, I don't see why
People dawging me around
It must be that old evil spirit
That spirit drop me down in your ground
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit
Can greyhound bus that ride

CHORUS: Everybody would help, when the war was on, (3x)
Well, they registered everybody, when the war was on.
Well, it's just about a few years, and some months ago,
United States come and voted for war.
Sammy called the men from the East and the West:
"Get ready boys, we've got to do our best."
CHORUS
Well, President Wilson, sittin' on his throne,
Makin' laws for everyone.
Didn't call the black man, to lay by the white,
[guitar replaces words].
CHORUS
Price on the letter, begin to raise,
Gettin' no better, but the same old thing.
Eight cents on the dollar, ride the train,
Ratess gettin' cheaper, take a ride again.
CHORUS
First, you measure your boiler, measure your wheat,
Half a pound of sugar for a person a week. Folks didn't like it,
they blamed Uncle Sam,
I've got to save the sugar for the boys in France.
CHORUS
Well, boys whupped the Germans, home at last,
Would have brought the kaiser, but he run too fast.
Couldn't blame the kaiser for a-leavin' the land,
Sammy, he had to save the skin of a most evil man.
CHORUS
Tax gettin' heavy, have to pay,
Helped the boys, over across the sea.
Mud and water up to their knees,
Faced the kaiser for you and me.
CHORUS

I don't know what day it is
Or if it's dark or fair
Somehow, that's just the way it is
And I don't really care
I go to this or that place
I seem alive and well
My head is just a hat place
My breast an empty shell
And I've a faded dream to sell
All alone, all at sea
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love
Why is my heart so frail?
Like a ship without a sail.
Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart
I'm on the ocean
Guided by just a lonely heart
Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail
Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail

Boxes stacked up to the ceiling
All wrapped up in Christmas feeling
Golden bells caress the mistletoe
The colors glow, red, silver, green and blue
And this I know, this rainbow came
From you trimmed with dew
Though my heart is overflowing
Loving all the love you're showing
What I'd value most would be your call
To tell me when you'll be home in my arms again
The loveliest Christmas present of them all
What I'd value most would be your call
To tell me when you'll be home in my arms again
The loveliest Christmas present of them all

Strange angels, why do you treat me so mean?
You look strange angel
Now why do you treat me so mean?
You're the meanest little girl that I most ever seen
You left me this morning and didn't even say goodbye
Yes, you left me this morning
And didn't even say goodbye
I wanna love you, baby, but I don't know the reason why
Ah, when I said goodbye, baby, I didn't mean for you to go
When I said goodbye, baby, I didn't mean for you to go
You get devilin' on your mind
And I ain't never see you anymore

Easy
Take love easy, easy easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy breezy
Easy come and easy go
Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break oh-so slightly
When your baby says goodbye
That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it with velvet gloves
And you won`t get your fingers burned
Take love easy, easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can
Take love easy, easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy, easy
Easy, easy come and easy go
Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break, oh so slightly
When your baby says goodbye
That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it, handle it with velvet gloves
And you won`t get your fingers burned
Take love easy, easy easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can`t take it easy
Take it easy as you can
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, take it easy

Chegou a hora d'agente conversar sobre o nosso amor

Every evening, when all my day's work is through
I call my baby, and ask him what shall we do
I mention movies, but he don't seem to dig that
And then he asks me, why don't I come to his flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By playing records besides a groovy hi-fi
I say yeh yeh, and that's what I say
I say yeh yeh
My baby loves me, she gets a feeling so fine
And when she love me, she makes me know that she's mine
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
And when she asks me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh
We'll play a melody and
Turn the lights down low so that none can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh yeh, yeh yeh
Pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
Don't need to ask me if everything is OK
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh
We'll play a melody and
Turn the lights down low so that none can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh yeh, yeh yeh
Oh pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
Don't need to ask me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh
That's what I say, I say yeh yeh
That's what I say, I say yeh yeh
That's what I say, yeah

Always together until forever living with dreams that we shared
Two hearts together until forever showing the world that we cared
You won't be lonely I'll love you only I'll live my life just for you
Always together until forever our love will always be true
(Always together until forever) living with dreams that we shared
(Two hearts together until forever) showing the world that we cared
You won't be lonely I'll love you only I'll live my life just for you
Always together until forever our love will always be true

Oh there's nothin' like a woman
When you're all alone
No there's nothin' like a woman
To make a man come home
She's always there to understand
The little boy inside of the man
Oh there's nothin' like a woman
Nothin' at all
She knows when to hold you
And when to leave you alone
She's there to console you
When everything in the world's gone wrong
She lights a candle
And gets that look in her eye
And she's says boy you can handle
Staying up with me all night
Oh there's nothin' like a woman
When you're all alone No there's nothin' like her lovin'
To make a man come home
She's always there to understand
The little boy inside of the man
No there's nothin' like a woman
Nothin' at all
No there's nothin' like a woman
When you're all alone
No there's nothin' like a woman
To make a man come home
She's always there to understand
The little boy inside of the man
No there's nothin' like a woman
Nothin' at all

Have you ever heard of a wish sandwich? A wish sandwich is the kind of a sandwich where you have two slices of bread and you, hee hee hee, wish you had some meat...
Bow bow bow...
Ummm... the other day I had a ricochet biscuit. A ricochet biscuit is the kind of a biscuit that's supposed to bounce back off the wall into your mouth. If it don't bounce back... you go hungry!
Bow bow bow...
Umm, umm, umm... the other day I had a cool water sandwich and a Sunday-go-to-meetin' bun...

A turn of the tide or the weather
Are things we accept as they come
But since you and I've been together
The change in my heart leaves me numb
I Never Felt This Way Before I met you
You stole my heart and what is more
I let you
I fell in love too often I won't deny
But my heart didn't soften till you came by
When I discovered you between romances
I looked at you and read between your glances
This is one romance I can't ignore
I Never Felt This Way Before.
I Never Felt This Way Before I met you
You stole my heart and what is more
I let you
I fell in love too often I won't deny
But my heart didn't soften till you came by
When I discovered you between romances
I looked at you and read between your glances
This is one romance I can't ignore
I Never Felt This Way Before.

From the Indians who welcomed the pilgrims
And to the buffalo who once ruled the plains
Like the vultures circling beneath the dark clouds
Looking for the rain
Looking for the rain
Just like the cities staggered on the coastline
Living in a nation that just can't stand much more
Like the forest buried beneath the highway
Never had a chance to grow
Never had a chance to grow
And now it's winter
Winter in America
Yes and all of the healers have been killed
Or sent away, yeah
But the people know, the people know
It's winter
Winter in America
And ain't nobody fighting
'Cause nobody knows what to save
Save your soul, Lord knows
From Winter in America
The Constitution
A noble piece of paper
With free society
Struggled but it died in vain
And now Democracy is ragtime on the corner
Hoping for some rain
Looks like it's hoping
Hoping for some rain
And I see the robins
Perched in barren treetops
Watching last-ditch racists marching across the floor
But just like the peace sign that vanished in our dreams
Never had a chance to grow
Never had a chance to grow
And now it's winter
It's winter in America
And all of the healers have been killed
Or been betrayed
Yeah, but the people know, people know
It's winter, Lord knows
It's winter in America
And ain't nobody fighting
'Cause nobody knows what to save
Save your souls
From Winter in America
And now it's winter
Winter in America
And all of the healers done been killed or sent away
Yeah, and the people know, people know
It's winter
Winter in America
And ain't nobody fighting
'Cause nobody knows what to save
And ain't nobody fighting
Cause nobody knows, nobody knows
And ain't nobody fighting
'Cause nobody knows what to save

It's just like looking for a needle in a haystack
Searching for a moonbeam in the blue
Still I've got to find you
It's just like looking for a raindrop in the ocean
Searching for a dewdrop in the dew
Still I've got to find you
I'll roam the town in hope that we'll meet
Look at each face I pass on the street
Sometimes I feel the beat of your feet
But it's just my imagination
Though it's like looking for a needle in a haystack
Still I'll follow everything you do
'Cause I've got to find you

Boss, dat bird mean trouble.
Once de buzzard fold his wing an' light over yo' house,
All yo' happiness done dead.
Buzzard keep on flyin' over, take along yo' shadow.
Ain' nobody dead dis mornin'
Livin's jus' begun.

Sharin' grief an' sharin' laughter,
An' love like Augus' sun.

Lookin' lean an' hungry?
Don' you let dat buzzard keep you
Hangin' round my do'.
Ain' you heard de news this mornin'?
Step out, brudder, hit de gravel;
Porgy who you used to feed on,
Don' live here no mo'
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Buzzard, on yo' way!
Ole age, what is you anyhow,
Nuttin' but bein' lonely.
Pack yo' things an' fly from here,
Carry grief an' pain.
Dere's two folks livin' in dis shelter
Eatin', sleepin', singin', prayin'.
Ain' no such thing as loneliness.
An' Porgy's young again.
Buzzard, keep on flyin',
Porgy's young again.

Why are people gay
All the night and day
Feeling as they never felt before
What is the thing
That makes them sing?
Rich man, poor man, thief
Doctor, lawyer, chief
Feel a feeling that they can`t ignore
It plays a part in every heart
And every heart is shouting, "Encore"
Love is sweeping the country,
Waves are hugging the shore,
All the sexes
From Maine to Texas

Sharing joy alike

To be beside you could I ask for more
Each thrill beside you so worth waiting for
Such lips never have been I'm in a spin when we touch lips
I go dancing in the sky
I sigh beside you through winter's storm
For here beside you I'm forever warm
I must be feeling day dreams it isn't any crime
To want to be beside you 'til there's no more time
I sigh beside you through winter's storm
For here beside you I'm forever warm

It's time for a new understanding
If you're one of the many
Who the Family has let go
Hold on stay together when crashin'
Sellin' fake hits of Acid
To a college asshole
[Chorus]
I can tell that I disgust
Ugly old faces I see
You call us Mall rats
The town is callous to the kids on the street
Kids on the street
Kids on the street
Kids on the street...yeah
I know like an animal's knowledge
What you never acknowledge
And prefer to ignore
And I go like a brick through a window
There may be no tomorrow
I don't care anymore
Here I am I ruined your wall
Talk responsibility, ugliness, Mall rats, the town
Is callous to the kids on the street
Kids on the street
Kids on the street
Kids on the street
Oh, the kids on the street
Smarmy people I'd like to blow them all away
Vacant faces and language of clichs
Hypocrites aspiring to e all the same
I will act on all my dreams
And take things to extremes
In this time of a new understanding
With the darkness descending
And your money all gone
I will hang tough making weirdness a virtue
I will never desert you
In your quest for the dawn
I can tell that I disgust
Ugly old faces I see
You call us Mall rats
The town is callous to the kids on the street
Kids on the street
Kids on the street
Kids on the street...yeah
Oh, the kids on the street
Oh, the kids on the street
Oh, the kids on the street

Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive
The house that we built was once filled with laughter
But I changed that laughter to tears
And now I live in a world without sunshine
Ohh, I wish you were here
Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive
Last night I dreamed that you came to our house
To take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
Cause I drove every nail by myself
Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive
One more time
Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive
Shutters and boards

If I had a dime for every time,
I dreamed about you
(Dreamed about you)
I'll tell you no joke yes I'm really broke baby without you (girl without you)
And oh ho ho
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling
(Are you gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you love me
(Are you gonna break your promise to me)
And now you're actin' so strange
(Are you gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you need me
(Are you gonna break your promise to me)
If I saw you with somebody new, I'd be so helpless (be so helpless)
So tell me what are you gonna do, don't leave me breathless (leave me breathless)
And oh ho ho
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling
(I'm gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you love me
(I'm gonna break your promise to me)
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling
(I'm gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you love me

Now you're actin' so strange, baby

You said that you need me

You know last night about nine o'clock
Talking
He showed us the ??
And he jumped in bed
He looked down at me
And this is what he said
Time marches on
Now I looked at myself
Sometime ago
And I noticed that my wrinkles had begun to show
And now I know
I better take it slow
The night I used to play
A lot of sand lot balls?
I carried the pig skin
When it turn and fall
But now I can't
Can't even run it off
Time marches on
I used to have some women
Tall brown and short
I used to keep a woman in every port
The lord knows
They only in my thoughts
Time marches on
And now after all
Is said and done
What good is life without having fun
Cause life is given but only once
Time marches on
You know the young gets old
And the old gets cold
Time marches on

If my heart could only talk
Heaven would be mine
If my heart could only talk
Life would be divine
You would hear my song of love so tender
It would thrill you until you willingly surrender
If my heart could only talk
Dreams would all come true
'Neath the starlight I would walk
Hand in hand with you
I would have to seek your lips
Thrill you to your fingertips
If my heart could only talk
If my heart could only talk
Dreams would all come true
'Neath the starlight I would walk
Hand in hand with you
I would have to seek your lips
Thrill you to your fingertips
If my heart could only talk

High price lyin'
Nosey pryin'
Twistin' facts
Behind their backs
So low down
Over town
Bad mouth friends
Till the end
Girl you hear
Say this go get 'em
You lie 'em
Truth sound better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
Rank and evil
Edge of legal
Bent church steeple
Connin' people
Back fence talk
Chicken squawk
Square goods save
Tidal wave
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
No plea bargain
No cheap cop out
The truth sound better

No plea bargain

In hell, Satan's go-getter

Next time your found, with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned, so look around
Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant, can't
Move a rubber tree plant
But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes
So any time your gettin' low
'Stead of lettin' go
Just remember that ant
Oops there goes another rubber tree plant
When troubles call, and your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned, that wall could fall
Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam
'Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes
So any time your feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam
All problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go pop
Oops there goes another problem kerplop

I'm gonna bring it down front

I can see clearly you'd be with me
This is my chance and I'm not gonna blow it

Just kiss me just kiss me
Please don't move just kiss me
Just kiss me and I'll know
You don't have to tell me of your desire
'Cause I'll never hear you while my heart's on fire
So don't explain kiss me
Just kiss me and I'll know

To have and to hold you

Ah when your lips meet mine
So don't explain kiss me

(And I'll know)

The look
As she pass she flashed that come-hither look
The look
That was meant for me and for me alone
The look
Would be out of place in a children's book
The look
That could chip a piece off a heart of stone
Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look
I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

Copper colored gal of mine,
I love you 'cause you're so divine,
Say you'll always be my clinging vine,
Copper, copper, copper, copper colored gal of mine!
You've done something to my heart,
You've upset my applecart,
Tell me, honey, when the moon will shine,
Copper colored gal of mine!
Oh, gee, sweet as can be,
You're aces with me,
I mean, aces high,
Me, oh my!
You know why!
Come on, honey, name the day,
The weddin' band is on its way.
Life with you would always be divine,
You copper colored gal of mine!

Citizens of planet earth don't get caught in the act
Don't strive to destruction the flash it's just that
There's something behind these walls, something under the sheets, I stay
A truth that's been locked in way down in me
You've got to get up, around your space
And take a, take a little time to contemplate
Will we ever see what it's like behind these walls
And are you, are you still moving up every time you fall, stop
Think a little about what you got
Stop, think a little about what you got
And start again
I could be you, you
And you, you
You could be me, me
And I, I, I could be you, you
And you, you
You could be me, me

Fallen down from paradise
Lying on the cold hard ground
She's singing in the moonlight
If you're lucky you can hear her sound
She can take you to that place
When you have had enough
Lose yourself, and don't hold back now
Open up your heart
When you're feeling like you're miles from home
The queen with no crown
Will take you down her own road
Running from Eldorado
She's got rubies in her eyes
She's got rubies in her eyes
She's got rubies in her eyes
Are you waking up at sunrise
As a number in the same old crowd
You're following the high life
Another shadow of the lost and found
She can take you to that place
When you can fall in love
Lose yourself, and don't hold back
Open up your heart
When you're feeling like you're miles from home
The queen with no crown
Will take you down her own road
Running from Eldorado
Running from Eldorado
She's got rubies in her eyes
She's got rubies in her eyes
She's got rubies in her eyes
Oh donʼt you know
When you're feeling like you're miles from home
The queen with no crown
Will take you down her own road
Running from Eldorado
Running from Eldorado
She's got rubies in her eyes
She's got rubies in her eyes
She's got rubies in her eyes
When youʼre feeling like youʼre miles from home
Running from Eldorado
 

Just one more chance
To prove it's you alone I care for
Each night I say a little prayer for
Just one more chance
Just one more night
To taste the kisses that enchant me
I'd want no others if you'd grant me
Just one more chance
I've learned the meaning of repentance
Now you're the jury at my trial
I know that I should serve my sentence
Still I'll hoping all the while
You'll give me
Just one more word
I said that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to cry my heart out
For just one more chance
I've learned the meaning of repentance
Now you're the jury at my trial
I know that I should serve my sentence
Still I'll hoping all the while
You'll give me
Just one more word
I said that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to cry my heart out
For just one more chance

So long toots, bound for Chicago, it's been swell
You got your hooks into me mamma, you know damn well
You know, I gotta leave before you're up a tree
And our good thing comes crashin' to the ground
So long toots, bound for Chicago, it's been grand
It just as might as well be Morocco or Pakistan
Tonight is new year's eve but there's nothin' up my sleeve
But a place to play where all the people swing around
They made a member of me so long toots, bound for Chicago now
So long toots, bound for Chicago, it's all right
I can't stay as long as I oughta, it's almost light
And that's the final star and you've been the best so far
But you're sleepin' all alone in that big sky
So long toots
(Bound for Chicago)
So long toots
(Bound for Chicago)
So long toots, bound for Chicago now

Into a cabaret
One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view
When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark
Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there
I'm a little jazz bird
And I'm telling you to be one too
For a little jazz bird
Is in heaven when it's singin' blue
I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate
When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone
Just try my recipe
And I'm sure you'll agree
That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be
I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate
When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone
Just try my recipe
And I'm sure you'll agree
That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be

The time has come
For me to start packing in
I'm folding the shores of my life
Into valises
I can't stand
This desert heat no more
I'm going away
I'm going away
I waited too long
To catch your signal
I counted the numbers, the letters, the days
Something tells me you're
You're not coming
I've got to go away
I'm going away
Now I'm writing you a letter
And I'm making it long
Now I'm breathing and I'm bleeding
And the pages are torn
Now I'm writing you to tell you
I may go missing and lost
The sand covers my face
The sand covers my face (covers my face)
The sand covers my face (covers my face)
(covers my face)
My mama said
"Life is for living
If you ain't happy, honey
Go out and reinvent yourself"
The desert is good
The desert is dark
I've got to go away
Said I'm going away

Sunbeams are gently fading, slowly fading,
And birds are waiting to do their mating,
When eventide is nigh, moonbeams are descending,
The day is ending, a happy ending,
The sun is sinking below the western sky.
Chorus:
Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown,
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping,
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven,
When night is falling and love is calling me home.
Daydreams through fields of clover, will soon be over,
And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day,
Sweet dreams have just begun, dear, the day is done, dear,
When skies grow dimmer,
And stars will glimmer along the starlit way.
Chorus:
Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown,
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping,
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven,
When night is falling and love is calling me home.

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you and you alone were meant for me
Please, give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

Stop this world, let me off
There's just too many pigs in the same trough
There's too many buzzards sitting on the fence
Stop this world, it's not making sense
Stop this show, hold the phone
Better days this girl has known
Better days so long ago
Hold the phone, won't you stop the show
Well, it seems my little playhouse has fallen down
I think my little ship has run aground
I feel like I'm in the wrong place
My state of mind is a disgrace
Won't you stop this game, deal me out I know too well what it's all about
I know too well that it had to be
Stop this game well it's ruining me
Well I got too smart for my own good
I just don't do the things I know I should
There's bound to be some better way
I just got one thing more to say
And that is
Stop this game, deal me out I know too well what it's all about
I know too well that it had to be
Stop this game well it's wrecking me

I see your face before me
Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always
If you could share the magic
If you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase
Your beautiful face before me.
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase
Your beautiful face before me.

Blues on my mind, blues all around my head
Blues on my mind, and blues all around my head
I dreamed last night that the man that I love was dead
I went to the graveyard, fell down on my knees
I went to the graveyard, fell down on my knees
And I asked the gravedigger to give me back my real good man please
The gravedigger look me in the eye
The gravedigger look me in the eye
Said "I'm sorry lady but your man has said his last goodbye"
I wrung my hands and I wanted to scream
I wrung my hands and I wanted to scream
But when I woke up I found it was only a dream

It's been a long time coming but a change is gonna come
When the dark clouds pass away, feel the warmness of the sun
I know that You love me, oh yeah, I know that You care
I can't wait to be by Your side in the middle of the air, until my
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
It ain't gonna be easy but I'll be strong
Some say if You really cared it wouldn't take so long, yeah
For You to return for me if with You is where I ought to be
But I'm gonna believe until that day, I will until
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
Gotta wait, gotta wait on You, yeah, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stand still, I just wanna be in Your will
Just like David and Goliath, I gotta encourage my soul, yeah
Said I'm gonna stand still until
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
Until my change comes here's what I'll do
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
So I'm gonna wait on You, trust in, believe on, until
Renew my strength, keep holding on, I'll wait on You
I'm gonna lean on You, depend on You, cling to Him

Oh, Bill
Why can't you behave
Why can't you behave?
How in hell can you be jealous
When you know, baby, I'm your slave?
I'm just mad for you
And I'll always be
But naturally
If a custom-tailored vet
Asks me out for something wet
When the vet begins to pet, I cry "hooray!"
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
I enjoy a tender pass
By the boss of Boston, Mass
Though his pass is middle-class and not Backa Bay
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin' in my way
There's a madman known as Mack
Who is planning to attack
If his mad attack means a Cadillac, okay!
But I'm always true to to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin' in my way
I've been asked to have a meal
By a big tycoon in steel
If the meal includes a deal, accept I may
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, Darlin' in my way
I could never curl my lip
To a dazzlin' diamond clip
Though the clip meant "Let 'er rip", I'd not say "Nay!"
But I'm always true to to you, darlin, in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin' in my way
There's an oil man known as "Tex"
Who is keen to give me checks
And his checks, I fear, mean that sex is here to stay!
But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin' in my way
There's a wealthy Hindu priest
Who's a wolf, to say the least
When the priest goes too far East, I also stray
But I'm always true to to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin'in my way
There's a lush from Portland, Ore
Who is rich but such a bore
When the bore falls on the floor, I let him lay
But I'm always true to to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin',in my way
Mister Harris, plutocrat
Wants to give my cheek a pat
If the Harris pat means a Paris hat, ok. Oo-la-la!
Mais je suis toujours fidele, darlin', in my fashion
Oui, je suis toujours fidele, darlin', in my way
From Ohio, Mister Thorne
Calls me up from night 'til morn
Mister Thorne once corner'd corn and that ain't hay
But I'm always true to to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
From Milwaukee, Mister Fritz
Often moves me to the Ritz
Mister Fritz is full of Schlitz and full of play
But I'm always true to to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
Mister Gable, I mean Clark
Wants me on his boat to park
If the Gable boat means a sable coat, anchors aweigh!
But I'm always true to to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way

I see your ups and downs
Your in and outs, your round and rounds
I know how you feel
It ain't time to be giving up,
though you feel you've had enough
You've got a place in God's will
You say when does it end and now that all depends
Are you ready to fight?
You know there's a war going on
You don't have to sing another sad song,
It's all been said and done
CHORUS
No weapon that's formed against you
No weapon that's formed
Against you shall prosper
(REPEAT)
Consider this my friend,
you're not fighting to win
For the battle is won
But you wrestle to sustain,
Your hope and eternal gain
Given by the Son
Your tests and trials come to make you strong
For I know you can make it through, yeah
Gold without fire can never be pure gold,
your trials come to perfect you
CHORUS * (REPEAT)
BRIDGE
No weapon that is formed shall prosper this I know
There is no room for doubt, for I know He'll work it out
They can say what they want, do what they want to do
The weapon may form, but it never will prosper
CHORUS
Please don't be deceived by the factual reality
Your trouble won't last always
For they're all subject to change
For He brought principalities and defeated the enemy
I encourage you my friend
Hold the truth until the end
CHORUS

Bernadette, people are searchin' for the kind of love that we possess.
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
and never find the love I've found in you.
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes,
and I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend,
when all the time they long to persuade you from my side.
They'd give the world and all they own for just one moment we have known.
Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives,
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live.
But while I live only to hold you some other men,
they long to control you
But how can they control you Bernadette,
when they can not control themselves,Bernadette,
from wanting you, needing you
but darling, you belong to me.
I'll tell the world you belong to me,
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me,
I'll tell the world you're a part of me.
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind the world is searching for,
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine has always been longing for.
In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore,
that's why I treasure you and place you high above,
for the only joy in life is to be loved.
So whatever you do,
Bernadette, keep on loving me, Bernadette, keep on needing me Bernadette.
Bernadette you belong to me,
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me,

Susan, the boys around the village square are courtin' Susan
They're even wishing they could be supportin' Susan
But every night in the pale moonlight it's Susan
Refusing to settle down or cuddle up
Susan has got that certain air the boys call supersonic
The barbers in the town are running out of tonic
The local romeos are at their Sunday best
Struttin' down the avenue buzzing like the bees around Susan
It's confusin' and amusin'
Susan has made up her mind who's she choosin'
Who's she's gonna be
Susan's in love with me
Susan has got that certain air the boys call supersonic
The barbers in the town are running out of tonic
The local romeos are at their Sunday best
Struttin' down the avenue buzzing like the bees around Susan
It's confusin' and amusin'
Susan has made up her mind who's she choosin'
Who's she's gonna be
Susan's in love with me

Teeny Bopper, my teenage lover
I caught your waves last night
It sent my mind to wonderin'.
You're such a groove
Please don't move
Please stay in my love house by the river.
Fast talkin' guys with strange red eyes
Have put things in your head
And started your mind to wonderin'
I love you so, please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino.
Mendocino, Mendocino,
Where life's such a groove
You blow your mind in the morning.
We used to walk through the park,
Make love along the way in Mendocino.
(Ah, play it, Augie! Yeah!)
Hey!
Like I told you, Can you dig it?
If you want to groove, I'll be glad to have you.
'Cause I love you so, please don't go,
Please stay here with me in Mendocino,
Mendocino, Mendocino
Where life's such a groove,
You blow your mind in the morning
We used to walk through the park,
Make love along the way in Mendocino
Mendocino, Mendocino, Mendocino

Blue smoke goes drifting by
Into the deep blue sky
And when I think of home
I sadly sigh
Oh I can see you there
With loving tears in your eyes
As we finally said our last good byes
And as I sailed away with a longing to stay
I promised I'd be true and love only you
Blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky
My memories of home will never die
Blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky
My memories of home will never die

I sat alone and watched TV
What a feeling can't be changed
As they say a smile won't catch your eye
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to loving
Let us be loving, let us be loving
Let us be, let us be, lets us be
Let us be, let us be, lets us be
And the grass out there on the riverside
It don't have to grow
Out into this forest wide
You reap just what you sow
Lonely in this jungle deep
A smile won't catch my eye
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye to loving
Let us be loving, let us be loving

I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with alarm
British museum, had lost its charm
How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere

Well, it's finally sinkin' in, you ain't comin' back
I'll get my old guitar down off the rack
And sing the blues about you, baby, sing the blues about you, baby
It's really bringin' me down, I'm just mopin' around
I got the blues about you, baby
Well, the hardest thing honey 'bout havin' the blues
Like walkin' the floor in a dead man's shoes
I got the blues about you, baby, I got the blues about you, baby
Maybe this homemade wine will wash you outta my mind
I got the blues about you, baby
I keep knockin' at the door but you won't let me in
I'll be back tomorrow night a knockin' again
I got the blues about you, baby, I got the blues about you, baby
I'm a fool for you, I got nothin' to lose
I got the blues about you, baby, alright
Well, now honey, if we had a little heart to heart
Maybe we could find us a brand new start
I got the blues about you, baby, I got the blues about you, baby
Well, I'm a fool for you, I ain't got nothin' to lose
I'm a fool about you, baby
Well, now I can't sleep but just lay in bed
Starin' at the ceiling, going outta my head
I got the blues about you, baby, I got the blues about you, baby
It's really bringin' me down, I'm just a mopin' around
I got the blues about you, baby, alright kid
You know you really oughta be ashamed of yourself
For breakin' my heart and ruinin' my health
I got the blues about you, baby, I got the blues about you, baby
Well, you committed the crime but I'm doin' the time
I got the blues about you, baby
I got the blues about you baby, I got the blues about you, baby
I'm a fool for you, I ain't got nothin' to lose
I got the blues about you, baby

In the twilight glow I see,
Blue eyes crying in the rain,
When we kissed goodbye and parted,
I knew we'd never meet again,
Love is like a dying ember,
And only memories remain,
And through the ages I'll remember,
Blue eyes crying in the rain,
Someday we'll meet up yonder,
And we will walk hand in hand again,
In a land that knows no parting,
Blue eyes crying in the rain,
Blue eyes crying in the rain,

The night is getting on, the band is getting show
The crowd is almost gone and here we are still dancin'
Nothing to do but waltz
Our feet can barely move, my legs are yellin'"Whoa"
But we're in such a groove that love is still advancin'
Nothing to do but waltz
You can't suggest that we could go on Jitterbuggin'
We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than huggin'
But we don't need much room to gently cut a rug in we two
I'm tired and out of juice and yet from head to toe
My body's feeling loose and warm and kind of supple
Nothing to do but waltz
The minutes slip away, my arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay 'til we're the only couple
Nothing to do but waltz
You never know how far this sort of thing will get you
We're not as tired as we would like to think, I bet you
You'd stay up half the night with me if I would let you
So come let the waltz play again

They don't want to legalize & they don't really
realize that weed's not a crime
They don't want to legalize & they don't really
realize that weed's sublime
1st Verse
(Z!GZAG)
Uhh, take a look inside these blood shot eyes
Zig-Zag he must be high smoke pot smellin' kind
of like a musty guy 'till the cops handcuff me (WHY)
isn't this shit legalized yet (NO) everybody knows
a place you can buy that do can't wait 'till it's
recreational I'm a step outside pack & blaze a
bowl gotta make sure that my day is full of a lot
of marijuana got jays to roll face it bro we
eventually every corner will see dispensaries
full of all type of expensive weed hopefully in
this century we'll see peace & quiet the streets
supply it we all get high LEGALIZE it
Chorus
(Breezy)
They don't want to legalize & they don't really
realize that weed's not a crime(2X)
They don't want to legalize & they don't really
realize that weed's sublime
2nd Verse
(Breezy)
I'm a marijuana pervert growing the weed from
the dirt in a tie-dye t-shirt having space cake for
desert reeking like a Cypress Hill concert
super-duper HIGH the feds & I got mad beef
because I be smoking that green leaf just for
stress relief I got a fresh bowl of keef about to
chief I'm a peacekeeper reppin' the peace & loving
the reefer I heard it cures cancer why does
everybody think it's not the answer let's hotbox
'till the joint ends if you don't smoke weed then
we're not friends "they're blowing it" I'm a stoner
it's not a secret the F.B.I. & I are in a feud you
don't smoke you're a loser dude...
Chorus
3rd Verse
(Breezy)
Societies looking at me like I'm some kind of
joker but I don't want to be a "closet smoker"
I'm a recreational supporter other states recognize
that I got a medical disorder just put us on the
ballot man pass a bill why does everything I love
seem illegal most people just need the weed
we just want to be freed cultivate the seed & I
can't wait to smoke nonstop right in front of a cop
plant a crop & watch the cannabis scene explode
talking more than a truck load more than tobacco
but we gotta wait until our government says so
crossing my fingers saying let the people go let
my people grow
Chorus

A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turn to me
The gypsies say and I know why
A falling blossom only touches lips that lie
A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new
Beneath the moon
I thought you'd love me
You said you love me
We planned together
To dream forever
The dream has ended
For true love died
The day a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied

Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go
When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

Was there something more I could have done?
Or was I not meant to be the one?
Where's the life I thought we would share?
And should I care?
And will someone else get more of you?
Will she go to sleep more sure of you?
Will she wake up knowing you're still there?
And why should I care?
There's always one to turn and walk away
And one who just wants to stay
But who said that love is always fair?
And why should I care?
Should I leave you alone here in the dark?
Holding my broken heart
While a promise still hangs in the air
Why should I care?

Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha' gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsiblity?
Will you spend your days and nights in the pool room?
Will you sell caps of madness to the neighborhood?
Little ghetto boy
You already know how proud life can be
'cause you've seen so much pain and misery
Little ghetto boy
Your daddy was blown away
He robbed that grocery store
Don't you know that was a sad, sad old day?
All your young life
You've seen such misery and pain
The world is a cruel place to live
And it ain't gonna change
You're so young
You've got so far to go on
And don't think you'll reach your goal
Young man, little ghetto boy, look at you
Little ghetto boy
When, when, when you become a men
You can make things change if you just take the stand
You gotta believe it yourself in all you do
You've gotta fight to make it better
Then you will see how others will start believing to
Then, my son, things will start to get better
Everything has got to get better,
Everything has got to get better

There's a tear in your eye
And I'm wondering why
For it never should be there at all
With such pow'r in your smile
Sure a stone you'd beguile
So there's never a teardrop should fall
When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You should laugh all the while
And all other times smile
And now, smile a smile for me
When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away
For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright
Like the linnet's sweet song
Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light
For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get
When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

The moon and you appear to be
So near and yet so far from me
And here am I on a night in June
Reaching for the moon and you,
I wonder if we'll ever meet
My song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you.
I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you.

If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper
Super-duper
Come, let's mix where rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper
Super-duper
Come, let's mix where rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz

When you see land
(Out of the window of a train)
Kinda green and grassy,
(How in the world can you complain?)
Beneath a moon
(You ought to see the way it shines)
Bright beyond compare,
(The way it shines upon the pines)
When you hear blue jays chirping high and sassy,
And catch one sniff of southern cooking
Hanging on the evening air
(Supper's waiting on the table)
When you see folks
(Having their after dinner chats)
All polite and classy
(Gentlemen all remove their hats)
And every smile
(Perfect harmony and peace)
Bids you stay and rest,
(Hand the porter your valise)
Get off that train,
(Sit down and rest your chassis,)
You're in Tallahassee
(The Cap8ital City of Florida and)
The Southland at its best!
(But Dixie at its very best!)

Somewhere along the line
You met this heart of mine
Would you unwind it?
Now you would shun it over a glass of wine
Friends knew it all the time
That no wedding bells would chime
I was just a young dreamer, no match for a schemer
Yours was a lover's crime
Folks gossiped--they said it was too good to be true
They even bet you'd search for someone new
This pendent world of ours was paradise
And I was blind by the star dust in my eyes
While you like gambler with his last dime
I know you will try it one more time
But I prayed like Napoleon Bonaparte
You'll meet your Waterloo somewhere along the line
Somewhere along the line

I can't forget the night I met you
That's all I'm dreaming of
And now you call it madness
But I call it love
You made a promise, to be faithful
By all the stars up above
Now you call it madness
But I call it love
My heart is beating, it keeps repeating
For you constantly
You're all I'm needing, so I am pleading
Please come back to me
You made a plaything out of romance
And what were you thinking of
For now you call it madness
But I call it love

The Dipsy Doodle's the thing to beware
The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
The things you say will come out in reverse
Like "You love I and me love you"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
The Dipsy Doodle's easy to find
You know it's always in back of your mind
You never know it, until it's too late
And then you're in such a terrible state
Like "The moon jumped over the cow, hey diddle"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
Whenever you think you're crazy
You're just a victim of the Dipsy Doodle
Ah, but it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle
You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
You'll think you're crazy, the things that you'll say
Like "Rhythm got I and hot am I"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
If it gets you, you'll be singin' it
And we'll bet you, you'll be swingin' it
The Dipsy Doodle's the thing to beware
The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
Ev'rything you say will come out in reverse
"You love I and me love you"
That is just the way the Dipsy Doodle works
Whenever you think you're crazy
You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
But it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle
You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The dipsy doodle will get you some day
And you'll think you're crazy, the things you'll say
"Violets are red, roses are blue"
Roses, roses, roses, all around you
You'll never know it until too late
And then you're in such a terrible state
If you wanna do the Doodle, do the Dipsy Doodle
Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
Do the Dipsy Doodle now

[Janet Kay Cover]
I've been wanting you
For so long, it's a shame
Oh, baby
Every time I hear your name
Oh, the pain
Boy, how it hurts me inside
'Cause every time we meet
We play hide and seek
I'm wondering what I should do
Should I, dear, come up to you
And say, "How do you do?"
Would you turn me away
You're as much to blame
'Cause I know you feel the same
I can see it in your eyes
But I've got no time to live this love
No, I've got no time to play your silly games
Silly games
Yet, in my mind I say
"If he makes his move today
I'll just pretend to be shocked"
Oh, baby
It's a tragedy
That you hurt me
We don't even try
You're as much to blame
'Cause I know you feel the same
I can see it in your eyes
But I've got no time to live this love
No, I've got no time to play your silly games
Silly games
Silly games
Silly games (No, don't wanna play)
Silly games (Your silly)
No, I've got no time to play your silly games
No

If I had my druthers, I'd druther have my druthers
Than anything else I know
While you'd druther hustle, accumulatin' muscle
I'd druther watch daisies grow
While they're growin' slow
And the summer breeze is blowin'
My heart is overflowin' and so
If I had my druthers, I'd druther have my druthers
Than anything else I know
Robert, you think you could agree
With that kind of a philosophy?
Agree? I live it
If I had my druthers, I'd druther have my druthers
Than work anywheres at all
Don't nobody call
Huh, it ain't that I hates it
Why, in fact, I even contemplates it
While watchin' raindrops fall
I sits there for hours developin' my powers
Of figurin' how flowers gets tall
If I had my druthers, I'd druther have my druthers
Than anything else at all
If I had my druthers to choose from all the others
I'd druther be like I am
I like you just the way you are
This thing called employment
Detracts from my enjoyment
And tightens my diaphragm
Oh, you poor lamb
Whilst I'm doin' nary
A thing that's necessary
I'm happy as a cherry stone clam
Some of my best friends are clams
If I had my druthers to choose from all the others
I'd druther be like I am
If we had our druthers, we'd rather have our druthers
Than anything else we know
Our forefathers wrote it and often times we quote it
Whenever we're feelin' low
Monsieur John?
As direct descendants we figure independence
Ain't only in Missouri and so if we had our druthers
We'd rather have our druthers than anything else we know
Why sho', huh
Than anything else we know
Yebo', than anything else we know
Enco', than anything else we know
Goodnight, leave a call

Anything you want, anything at all
Anything you need, any time you call
Anywhere you are, anywhere you go
Any time at all, baby let me know
Well I hear the voices whisper
And I hear your lonesome cry
And I see the tears fallin'
And I know the reason why
Anything you want, anything at all, yeah
Anything you need, any time you call
Any time you cry, any time you fall
I will pick you up any time at all
Well I hear your voice within me
And I hear your tender call
And I know that life without you
Don't mean anything at all
Anything you want, anything at all
Anything you need, any time you call
Oh anything you dream, everything you know
Anywhere you lead, baby I will go
When trouble comes to call on you
And you can't take anymore
Any time you need a friend
Just knock upon my door
Anything you want, anything at all
Anything you need, any time you call
Anything you want, oh anything at all
Anything you need, any time you call
Oh and anything you dream and everything you know
Anywhere you lead, baby I will go, I will go, I will go
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything at all, anything, anything
Anything you want, anything at all
Anything you need, anything, anything
Anything, anything, anything

I woke up with the lark, this morning
I love the dawn of the day.
Roosters crow to me,
Crow hello to me.
Every tree says
Glad to see ya!
Dew is dewier, cows are moo-ier,
Soft winds blow.
Nobody ought to be lazy,
No, no, no!
I'm fresh as a daisy.
I feel so wonderful!
I woke up with the lark, this morning;
I yawned a little, and then,
Promised myself, yes I promised myself
That I'd Never
Do it Again!

Once they called it ragtime
And it had its fling
It's the same old syncopation
Now they call it swing
Then they played it jazz time
To a buck-and-wing
Once again it sweeped the nation
Now they call it swing
When singers used to sing
They would go hot cha
But with this modern thing
Now they go dru-do do, dra-da-da
Rhythm has its seasons
Summer, fall and spring
But for seven silly reasons
Someone pulled the string
And they started dancing
Now they call it swing

Our lips shouldn't touch
(Move over darling)
I like it too much
(Move over darling)
That gleam in your eyes
is no big surprise anymore
'Cause you fooled me before
I'm all in a spin
(Move over darling)
About to give in
(Move over darling)
And though it's not right
I'm too weak to fight it somehow
'Cause I want you right now
The way you sigh
has me waving my conscience bye bye
You can call me a fickle thing
But I'm practically yours forever, because
(I yearn to be kissed)
Move over darling
(How can I resist)
Move over darling
You captured my heart
and now that I'm no longer free
Make love to me
The way you sigh
Has me waving my conscience good bye
You can call me a fickle thing
But I'm practically yours forever, because
I yearn to be kissed
(Move over darling)
How can I resist
(Move over darling)
Please give me your love
I'm longing for you
I need all your love, honest I do
You captured my heart
and now that I'm no longer free
Make love to me
(Move over darling)
Make love to me
(Move over darling)
Make love to me
(Move over darling)
Make love to me
(Move over darling)

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan inside
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
A certain man in this little town
Keeps draggin' my poor heart around
All I see for me is misery
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan inside
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
Soon that deep blue sea
Will be callin' me
It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and cry
I gotta right to sit and sigh
Down around the river
Soon that deep blue sea
Will be callin' me
It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues
There's nothing left for me
I'm full of misery
I gotta right to sing the blues

I saw you strolling by your solitary
Am I nosy? Very, very
I'd like to be a juicy huckleberry
What you're after is a gal
We're both in luck, for introductions
Are not necessary
Mmm, would you like to take walk?
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?
Gee, the moon is yeller
Sump'n good'll come from that
Mmm, have you heard the latest song?
Mmm, it's a very pretty strain
Mmm, don't you feel a little thrilly?
Gee, it's getting chilly
Sump'n good'll come from that
When you're strolling though the wheresies
You need a whosies to lean upon
But when you have no whosies
To hug and whatsies, gosh, darn
Mmm, would you like to take walk?
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
Mmm, ain't you tired of the talkies?
I prefer the walkies
Sump'n good'll come from that
My little heart is full of palpitation
What I need is consolation
I'd like to stage a little celebration
In the moonlight, right away
I'll feel all pepped if you'll accept
My friendly invitation
Mmm, would you like to take walk?
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?

In the warm yellow glow of the Christmas Candles
I see the magic of Christmas shining bright, shining bright
Like the star that led the kings and shepherds
All to a tiny stable on that night, Holy night
With the lambs and the donkeys, cows and the camels breathing low
The perfect Child of God was born so long ago
In the dancing flame of the Christmas candles
I hear the whisper of angels soft and clear, soft and clear
As they watched in the night over Baby Jesus
I know they're watching me, always near, always near
I love the Christmas gifts and the trimming of the tree
Like the candles they remind us what Christmas really means
So, tonight as we light our Christmas candles
I'll hold the love of Jesus in my heart, in my heart
And keep the flame where the spirit of Christmas starts

If you ain't wrong, you're right
If it ain't day, it's night
If you ain't sure, you might
Gotta be this or that
If it ain't dry, it's wet
If you ain't got, you get
If it ain't gross, it's net
Gotta be this or that
If it ain't sis, you can't miss
It's got to be your brother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other
If it ain't full, it's blank
If you don't spend, you bank
If it ain't Dee, it's Frank
Gotta be this or that

Our house in a dull grey suburb where the buildings are comin' down
We live in the Polish Catholic Irish part of the town
I'll be waitin' for you, you'll be makin' a scene
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Help you find your way out, then we'll get you clean

Find you at the end of the night
He likes Old Sytle the cerveza fria at the tavern down by the park
He'll be OK but unless you're local don't go walkin' there after dark
I'll be waitin' for you, you'll be makin' a scene
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Help you find your way out, then we'll get you clean
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Find you at the end of the night
You're my blood and my father
I'm just here to give you some help
We made our way back through the park
Just me and you and the dog
I felt the warm, brown syrup night
Pour over us 'till it was Rembrandt dark
I'll be waitin' for you, you'll be makin' a scene
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Help you find your way out, then we'll get you clean
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Find you at the end of the night
Find you at the end of the night
Find you at the end of the night

I've got an old tom cat
When he steps out
All the pussycats in the neighborhood
They begin to shout
"Here comes Ring Tail Tom
He's steppin' around the town
And if you got your heat turned on
You better turn your damper down"
-Yodel-
-Dobro Solo-
Ring Tail Tom on a fence
The old pussy cat on the ground
Ring Tail Tom come off of that fence
And they went around and around
Lord, he's quick on the trigger
He's a natural born crack shot
He finds a new target every night
And he sure does practice a lot
-Yodel-
-Dobro Solo-
He makes them roustabout
He makes them roll their eyes
They just can't resist my Ring Tail Tom
No matter how hard they try
You better watch old Ring Tail Tom
He's boss around the town
He won't have a pussy cat
Tomcattin' around
-Yodel-
-Dobro Solo-
Ring Tail Tom is the stuff
He struts around the town
All the pussy cats in the neighborhood
Can't get old Ring Tail down
He's always running around
Just can't be satisfied
He goes out every night
With a new one by his side
-Yodel-
-Dobro Solo-

When you hold me close, honey,
You're the most, baby,
You set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you, honey
I had to get you,
You have been my one desire
How could I help but love you
With a love so true,
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part,
It wouldn't be your fault, yeah,
It would be all mine
If you would ever leave me, honey,
It sure would grieve me, baby,
It would break my heart
But I won't let that worry me,
This love will always be,
It was meant right from the start
How could I help but love you,
With a love so true,
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part,
It wouldn't be your fault, yeah,
It would be all mine
When you hold me close, honey,
You're the most, baby,
You set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you, honey,
I had to get you,
You have been my one desire
How could I help but love you,
With a love so so true,
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part

One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve
In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me
You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go
I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin through
In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me
You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go
And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside I know
I know,
When all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows
You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go
And you love me but you don't
You love me but you don't
You love me but you don't know who I am
And you love me but you don't
You love me but you don't
You love me but you don't know who I am

Quiet nights and quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet nights and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely
This is where to be
Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was a only a bitter tragic joke
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh, my love
This is where to be
Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was a only a tragic joke
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh, my love

A bold young farmer courted me
He stole my heart and my liberty
He stole my heart without free goodwill
And I must confess that I love him still
I wish, I wish but its all in vain
I wish I was a maid again
But a maid again I never can be
Since such a young fellow lies still by me
There sits a bird in yonder tree
Some say hes blind and cannot see
And I wish it was the same with me
Before I took up with your company
I wish my babe so tiny was born
And smiling on his fathers knee
And I poor girl was dead and gone
With the green grass growing all over me

One day I'm gonna leave you, I know you think I won't.
Well, gonna find someone to love me.
Because you think I won't. You always too tired.
Always, too tired to give me a little kiss.
I know, you are trying to hide.
Trying to hide. Take my name off of your list.
I said I'm gonna find someone to love.
Because you think I won't.
Play me a little blues. Satisfy me.
Play, play me a little blues and try and satisfy me.
Babe, you trying to hide.
Said take my name off of your list.
Let me hear from you little brother!
(Guitar Solo)
You trying to be so slick,
Whenever you come home.
Covering up by saying "you are sick",
Whenever you have been wrong.
Oh I know, I have to leave you.
And you know, you think I won't.
I said I'm gonna find, me someone to love me.
Because, because, you say I don't love no one but you.
But I, I know you a liar.
Someone out there, someone out there, is trying.
You tried to be slick, whenever you do come home.
Covering up, by saying "you are sick"
When you know you been wrong.
I just gotta leave you. I know you think I won't.
I gotta find, I gotta find, someone to love me.
Because, I know you say, say I won't. Lord have mercy.
I just gotta find someone. I know they're out there.
Looking for a true love. I know a true love, true love,
A true love, a true love is hard, true love, true love,
Is hard, true love, true love, Is-a hard; to find.
And you'll never find another like-a me,
I'm gonna leave you.

I was thinking you and me
Could start again, fulfill a dream
Read that somewhere we would find, paradise
Walls of change have clearly fell
Sure with loves cry out for help
If you'd only try with me and see that we
Should be trying to find a 'cause
Before a problem flaws
But know that just to be with, you in a love that truly free
That could be you and me
It was something to see, 'cause you know we're too far gone
To ever be, the same way we been so long
It was something to see, we can make it if we hold on
The way it should be, with love leading us along
Love so beautiful to me, now's the chance for all to see
All you need is to believe, that love's the key
With peace between us, you and me, then a crystal city's where we could be
Then there'd be no mystery, just free to be
Only trying to find a cause,
Before a problem flaws
But know that just to be with you, and in love was all it was
It should ever be because
It was something to see cause you know we're too far gone
To ever be, the same way we been so long
It was something to see, we can make it if we hold on
The way it should be, with love leading us along, love leading us along

Whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks, What's she running from?
Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her it never dies
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies

Cry every night I do
Cry every night for you
Why'd you leave me out here with these wolves
I'm fragile
My side really needs you back
It's lonely without my half
Why you got me living out
These dreams without you
My half ain't whole
I'm just me without my soul
My me needs you
I'm just part of what makes one of two
I'm just one side without my right side
Lose my back bone without my right side
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
I'm incomplete without my baby
I'm just one part of me without what makes me
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
Yes I'm a big girl yeah,
Yes I can handle this
Nothing comes better than when
It's you and I
Tried it before I did
Forgive me because I dipped
Left you lonely one side
Only let me back in
My half ain't whole
Just me without my soul
My me needs you
I'm just part of what makes one of two
I'm just one side without my right side
Lose my backbone without my right side
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
I'm incomplete without my baby
I'm just part of me without what makes me
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
Give me one time and I'll do better
But I won't go, we flow together
I cannot crave you like this anymore though
I cannot crave you like this anymore
Give me one time and I'll be cool
Mama won't go, she just needs you
I cannot crave you, I just cannot crave you
I cannot crave you like this anymore
My half ain't whole
Just me without my soul
My me needs you
I'm just part of what makes one of two
I'm just one side without my right side
Lose my backbone without my right side
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
I'm incomplete without my baby
I'm just part of me without what makes me
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
I'm just one side without my right side

Packing my crib and I'm taking a trip out of town
Over the weekend
Must have a change from the sight of this strange lonely town
Over the weekend
Far from the noise of the crowd
There must be some place for me
Where I can shout to the clouds
Shout that I'm free
High on a mountain top
Time and the world will stop, I know what ill find
Love uninhibited, nothing prohibited
If its insane I don't care, let me lost my mind
Monday will seem as unreal as a dream in the night
Over the weekend
Back on the train I could never explain my delight
Over the week end
Will I have any regrets
Back in the hole in the wall?
How long before I could get
The thrill of it all?
I think that I can hold on
To love when it's over and gone
I'll let the curtain descend
Over the weekend
Oh, oh, what a dream, what at time, oh, what a day
Oh, love, love, love
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
I wanna shout from the highest mountain top
Oh, what a night, it was right
Right here, right now

If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in the world today
We would go on lovin' in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight
Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind
Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight

My baby stay out all night long,
keeps me worried all the time
My baby stay out all night long,
keeps me worried all the time
I know she's done me wrong,
She nearly drove me out of my mind
She leave early in the mornin',
wouldn't come home till broad daylight
She leave early in the mornin',
wouldn't come home till broad daylight
But my baby don't do that no more,
yes, she decided to do me right
Early Tuesday mornin',
she's got wrong doin' on her mind
Early Tuesday mornin',
she's got wrong doin' on her mind
She said, "Daddy, daddy, daddy",
and almost drove me out of my mind

Good evening everyone and welcome
To the United States of America
And indeed we have congregated here at this time
To celebrate a most treasured wellspring of contemporary music
It is the sound which historians in the far future might catalog
Under twentieth century pre-light-emitting-diode euphoric
But today the sound lives and tonight is sampled exclusively
For your entertainment pleasure
From the music capitals of this continent
This is the hard hitting show band of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues
Ladies and gentlemen, these are The Blues Brothers

There's a sneaky little side of me, the kind I want to set you free
So I can go see what's waitin' just over the hill
Every now and then I hear something whisper in my ear
Telling me somebody else could give me a thrill
Oh, the sneaky little side of me, the kind I want to go and see
If I could be happier walking with somebody new
But every time I start to go, something in my heart says no
And tells me how lucky I am belongin' to you
And this sneaky little side of me is learning fast
'Bout the way I'm livin' and the love I'm givin'
And the love that's gonna last
When you meet me at the door each night
And put your arms around me tight
I know that there just couldn't be anyone sweeter than you
Suddenly to my surprise, I begun to realize
That the sneaky little side of me is in love with you too
Oh, suddenly to my surprise, I begun to realize
That the sneaky little side of me is in love with you too
Sneaky little side of me, sneaky little side of me
Sneaky little side of me, sneaky little side of me

I similau, I similau
I similau, I similau
Spirit in the wood beat the hollow cane
Spirit in the wood take away the pain
Make the body ripe and alive again
I similau
(I similau, I similau)
Spirit in the heart make the blood flow fast
Spirit in the heart make the beauty last
Keep the hope alive when the youth go past
I similau
(I similau, I similau)
When my lover comes upon the scene
Drop a petal from the tree
Fling the mountain up into the sky
Fill the river with the sea

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will make a fuss about you
But how about me?
It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
But how about me?
You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten
And maybe, a baby
Will climb upon your knee and put its arms about you
But how about me?

This is a perfect day
The morning was meek
I, on this perfect day
Am equally weak
The sky looks gray
The clouds look mean
A darker day
I've never seen no light
We parted yesterday
My manner was cold
But now I find today
I'm not quite as bold
Ironically, your photograph
Just stares at me
It doesn't laugh or cry
Why do I contrive my own unhappy fate
All my life I'll die for melancholy bait
Slowly the fading light
Of this afternoon
Turns into endless night
Without any moon
A night designed for those resigned
Oppressive as an old cathedral tune
Why do I contrive my own unhappy fate
All my life I'll die for melancholy bait
Slowly the fading light
Of this afternoon
Turns into endless night
Without any moon
A night designed for those resigned
Oppressive as an old cathedral tune

I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
Me and my woman was just gettin' right
All systems on overload
The radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time
Steamy windows zero visibility
Steamy windows coming from the body heat
You can wine and dine with a woman all night
With good intent
But there's something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense
Steamy windows ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows coming from the body heat
There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes her snuggle up just a little bit closer
And it starts things happening again
Steamy windows zero visibility
Steamy windows coming from the body heat
Steamy windows zero visibility
Steamy windows coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Steamy windows

Went to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
I asked the Lord above to have mercy
Have mercy on old B, if you please
Oh, standin' at the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Oh, standin' at the crossroads
I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me
Everybody passed me by
(Everybody just passed me by)
Alright, yeah
Oh, the sun goin' down, boy
Now time won't catch me here
Oh, the sun goin' down, boy
Now time won't catch me here
I ain't got no lovin' sweet woman
Love and feel my care
You can run, you can run, boy
Tell my friend Willie Brown
Tell my friend Willie Brown
Run, run, run
Tell my friend Willie Brown
I'm standin' around
I believe I'm sinkin' down
I believe I'm sinkin' down
I believe I'm sinkin' down, my money
Oh, I went to the crossroads, mama
I looked east and I looked west
Well, I went to the crossroads, mama
Oh, I looked east and I looked west
Lord, I have no sweet woman
Well, in my distress
Please save old Bob, please help me if you can
(Please save old Bob if you please)
Save old B, if you please
If you please, save old Bob, if you please
Yeah

I'm a king bee
buzzing round your hive
I'm a king bee baby
buzzing round your hive
Together we can make honey now baby
If you let me come inside
I'm a king bee
I want you to be my queen
Well I'm a king bee, baby
Want you to be my queen
Well together we can make honey, baby
The world has never seen
Okay let's buzz a while
A buzz buzz (buzz buzz)
A buzz buzz (buzz buzz)
A buzz buzz (buzz buzz)
A buzz buzz (buzz buzz)

Waiting to be brought about
She turns before the grand reveal
And every time she chickens out
Those old familiar doubts she feels
Songs about a life unlived
Gifts she could not promise you
She'd lie across the bed and give
Oh but is that a song you would want to do
The greatness of this moon
Pours its concrete over your bed
And in the darkness of this room
She kneads you and you rise like bread
And you just lay back and rest
With what little time you share that bed
Put your loving arm across her breast
Half asleep and half undressed

You used to raise your voice so that it could be heard.
You used to shout out your orders, and your word was the final word.
Do as I say and not as I do.
They've taken your picture off the wall.
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?
You used to chase your women right into your home.
You used to tell them you loved them over the telephone.
Now they all see through you
And you're sinking like a stone.
No one's knocking at your door,
No one calls,
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?
You're sad and disgusted,
Is what you've grown up to be.
Bet you had no idea what your dream would turn out to be.
But when you live for yourself
Hell, it's hard on everyone.
But you did it your way and man you did it all.
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?
Now you did it your way and man, you did it all.
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Lived reckless so long
Justice system bust me wrong
Future stressed out like a rubber check
Don't be jeffing out the side of your neck
Dealin' from the bottom of the deck
Might make it home to the projects
Don't point no finger at me like you do
Know three of them is pointing back at you
Locked down, locked down!
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Long way from home, walking through a storm
Big yard survival keep me strong
Face I see in that old mirror
Too foggy and it ain't gettin' no clearer
Overcoat me like mess hall rations
Too much for the population
Don't point no finger at me like you do
Know three of them is pointing back at you
Locked down, locked down!
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I felt invisible everybody
The price of death come too cheap
Robbed and stole in the gap
Popped with a stray cap
Like I cornered rat
What you all know 'bout that?
Don't point no finger at me like you do
Know three of them is pointing back at you
Locked down, locked down!
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Come on, wail
Wail, Cotton Tail
Benny Webster, come on and blow for me
That's Cotton Tail
Come on, wail
Wail, Cotton Tail
Benny Webster, come on and blow for me
That's Cotton Tail

Turn out the stars
Turn out the stars
Let eternal darkness hide me,
If I can't have you beside me
Put out their fires,
Their endless splendour
Only reminds me of your tenderness
Stop the oceans roar,
Don't let the rivers run
Let me hear no more,
The wondrous music
of a skylark in the sun
Let it be done
Turn out the stars
Turn out the stars
Shut off their light
Stop every comet
in its magic lonely flight
Let there be light
Turn out the stars

Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember, somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you
A heart full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life
A heart full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

I am not brave, I am not brave,
I keep my focus on what is safe.
You drew a line, made up your mind,
And now I'm struggling to realize
I gotta wrap my head around
What my heart is telling me,
I've been trying to drown it out.
Just because I know what I am,
I am supposed to do now,
Doesn't mean I know, doesn't mean I know
How.
I am not brave, I am not brave,
I blind my eyes to what won't stay.
You kissed my mouth, you pushed me out
And now I'm struggling to free myself.
I gotta wrap my head around
What my heart is telling me,
I've been trying to drown it out.
Just because I know what I am,
I am supposed to do now,
Doesn't mean I know, doesn't mean I know
How.

Come out, come out wherever you are,
I know, I know you're not very far!
How I wish you'd hurry,
'Cause I'm inclined to worry;
These arms of mine are open,
Hoping you'll appear,
Where are you, dear?
Come out, come out wherever you are,
Come out, come out from under that star!
Yes, and incidentally,
Mentally,
I'm not up to par,
So come out, come out, come out,
Wherever you are.
So come out, come out, come out,
So come out, come out, come out,
Wherever you are.

I'd like to dedicate this to all of the Creator's righteous children
I have some food in my bag for you
Not that edible food the food you eat?
No I have some food for thought
Since knowledge is infinite it has infinitely fell on me
So umm
It was a stormy night
You know the kind where the lightning strike
And I was hangin' out wit some of my "artsy" friends
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh
The night was long the night went on
People coolin' out until the break of dawn
Incense was burnin' so I'm feelin right aight
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
& Ganny told me that when I was only a youth

And that's why I do what I do

And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me

And I take it everywhere I go
Cause I'm planting seeds

Ohh
You just don't want to be down
Down

We didn't break apart in stormy weather
We didn't run around like others do
Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather
'Cause we got the kind of love that'll see us through
[Chorus]
We've got smooth sailing, sailing
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailing, sailing
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on
We find each others arms in troubled waters
We found that's the safest place to go
From now we can laugh at troubled waters
'Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love grow
[Chorus: x2]

When autumn sings her lullaby
And green leaves turn to gold
Then I remember last September
You and I said goodbye
Whispering that we would be returning
When autumn comes again
Now autumn roams the hills once more
But you forgot your vow
Now here am I with, alone with only memories
Only lonely memories, autumn memories of you
[Chorus]
Love, when the leaves are turning
I get a hungry yearning for your arms
Love, when a heart is so blue
It shadows bright October's golden charm
The flaming moon reminds me of
The night of love that we once knew
Each tiny star is but a prayer
That when it's fall again, love will call again
And you'll be beside me to make
My autumn dreams come true
[Chorus]
The flaming moon reminds me of
The night of love that we once knew
Each tiny star is but a prayer
That when it's fall again, love will call again
And you'll be beside me to make
My autumn dreams come true

Spoken "oh, Play that thing boy, I know you're blue"
Don't want no woman
That run around
Stay out in the street
And like a badfoot clown
You made me love you
And you made me cry
You should remember, that you were born to die
The stream are yellow
Tossed it black and brown
I gotta black woman
Used to be the woman in town
You made me love you
And you made me cry
You should remember, that you were born to die
"Play it now for me"
I'm home at morning
Face full of frown
I know about that baby
You been running around
You made me love you
And you made me cry
You should remember, that you were born to die
Now look here woman
Give me your right hand
I thought you my woman
You go to your man
You made me love you
And you made me cry
You should remember, that you were born to die

Lord, this house is goin' to get raided, yes, sir!
Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall, turned to the wall,
Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall;
Look here, Mr. Jail-keeper, put another gal in my stall.
I don't mind bein' in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so long,
I don't mind bein' in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so long,
When every friend I have is done shook hands and gone.
You better stop your man from tickling me under my chin, under my chin,
You better stop your man from tickling me under my chin,
'Cause if he keeps on tickling, I'm sure gonna take him on in.

Love thy neighbor,
Walk up and say "How be ya
Gee! But I'm glad to see ya, pal,
How's tricks? What's new?"
Love thy neighbor,
Offer to share his burden,
Tell him to say the word "n"
You will see him through
Especially if there should be
a beautiful girl next door,
Say to that girl next door,
don't think I'm bold
But my mother told me to
Love thy neighbor
And you will find your labor,
A great deal easier,
Life'll be breezier
If you Love Thy Neighbor

Powder your face with sunshine
Put on a great big smile
Make up your eyes with laughter
Folks will be laughing with you in a little while
Whistle a tune of gladness
Blue never was in style
The future's brighter when hearts are lighter
So smile smile smile
Powder your face with sunshine

When you're wearing a great big smile

I'm lost in a dream
I nearly lost my mind
Well, I'm lost in my dream
I can't keep from cryin'
I'm lost in a dream
All because of you
And I'm lost in my dream
Don't know what to do
Well, sittin' down by the window
Watchin' the raindrops fall
Yeah, I'm thinkin' 'bout you darlin'
Well, I'm a hopin that you might call
Lord, tell me please
I nearly lost my mind
And I'm lost in my dream
Well, all the time
Well, a-sittin' down by the window
Just like we used to do
Well, I'm thinkin' of you darlin'
Oh, but baby I missed you
Lord, tell me please
I nearly lost my mind
And I'm lost in my dream
All the time.

Can you read the determination on my face
I'm as solid as the gravel now
And I kept gettin' on my feet after all
The times you knocked me down
Went back to see the place where I came from
And I began to understand my pride
From the brick streets, a northern factory town
Where Grandma's work improved my chances
Common man this is me
I'm not ashamed anymore to be
Here I am this is me
I'm glad you're uncomfortable near me
Never had nothin' never no one to care
Never had nothin'
Nothin' but the wind in my hair
Still I'm a millionaire
You see me standin' out on Fifth and Union
Right across from the abandoned Drive-In
The sun's gone down on the future here
The past won't leave my mind
Well, the rich boys gave up on ya
But the soul out here is much too strong
And I'll carry it with me for my whole life
The face of human dignity
Common man this is me
I'm not ashamed anymore to be
Here I am this is me
I'm glad you're uncomfortable near me
Yeah...me
Common man this is me
I'm not ashamed anymore to be
Here I am this is me
I'm glad you're uncomfortable near me
Uncomfortable near me
I don't have to be the boy with the most cake
I don't have to be the boy with the most cake
I don't have to be the boy with the most cake
I don't have to be the boy with the most cake
Still I'm a millionaire

As you are my love
As you are my love
Say you'll always be
Though the years go by
My heart will ever sigh
You're the love for me
Dearest always be as you are to me
You're my guiding star
What you are to me my love you'll ever be
Though you're near or far
It's so clear to me
Why you're so dear to me
As you are as you are
What you are to me my love you'll ever be
Though you're near or far
It's so clear to me

I have lived a life of sin, in this world I'm living in
I have done forbidden things I shouldn't do
I ask a beggar along the way if he could tell me where to stay
Where I could find real happiness and love that's true
Across the bridge there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge there's no more pain
The sun will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again
Follow the footsteps of the King, till you hear the voices ring
They'll be singing out the glory of the land
The river Jordan will be new,and the sound of trumpet you will hear
And you'll behold the most precious place never known to man
Across the bridge there's no more sorrow...
Across the bridge there's no more sorrow...

Pardon
I beg your pardon, my dear
Say you forgive me and please
Take me back in your heart
Pardon
Forgive my foolishness dear
Here in my arms you belong
For I was wrong right from the start
My own
You are the love of my life
What can I say, dear to prove
How much you mean to me
Amore
My love as long as I live
My heart is yours to behold
If you'll only forgive
My own
You are the love of my life
What can I say dear to prove
How much you mean to me
Amore
My love as long as I live
My heart is yours to behold
If you'll only forgive

I must say that I don't care
Hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend
I wish I had you back again
Oh nothing else means half as much as you
Our world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
Oh my lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

It's just a simple melody
Designed to haunt your memory
It's bound to get you instantly
Oh, it doesn't help you to beware
Before you even know it's there
You're swaying to its catchy air
Dancing with your favorite thrill
He will hold you closer still
And suddenly you'll both agree
That dancing can be heavenly
To just a simple melody
De de de, that melody
De de de, keeps haunting me
It's just a simple melody
De de, de de de, de de
Duh duh, doo doo, de de
De de, de de, doo doo de
Oh, da da doo, dum de, doo doo, melody

You take a hammer, you get some nails, you build a home
Find a woman put that woman in that little home
But without love, true, true love in that home
Yes, without love, that little home just ain't a home
You cheat a little, you leave your baby all alone
You bend the nails, you walk the boards in that little home
''cause without love, true, true love in that home
Yes, without love that little home can't be a home
Yes, without love in that home
There ain't a hammer big enough
So when your nights of fun are through
Don't be surprised to find yourself there all alone
''cause without love, true, true love in that home
Yeh, without love that little home just can't be a home
Yeh, without love that little home just can't be a home

The pale moon was rising above the green mountain,
The sun was declining beneath the blue sea,
When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain,
That stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee.
She was lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!
The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading,
And Mary, all smiling, was listening to me,
The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding,
When I won the heart of the Rose of Tralee.
Though lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!

Laid down last night, hopin' I would have my peace, eee
I laid down last night, hopin' I would have my peace, eee
But when I woke up, Tom Rushen1 was shakin' me
When you get in trouble, it's no use to screamin' and cryin', hmm
When you get in trouble, it's no use to screamin' and cryin', hmm
Tom Rushen will take you, back to the prison house flyin'
It were late one night, Halloway was gone to bed, hmm
It were late one night, Halloway was gone to bed, hmm
Mister Day2 brought whiskey taken from under Halloway's head
An' it's boozy booze, now, Lord, to cure these blues
It takes boozy boo', Lord, to cure these blues
But each day seems like years in the jailhouse where there is no boo'
I got up this mornin', Tom Day was standin' around
I got up this mornin', Tom Day was standin' around
If he lose his office now, he's runnin' from town to town
Let me tell you folksies just how he treated me
Let me tell you folksies just how he treated me
Aw, he caught me yellin', I was drunk as I could be

Go for a ride
In the still of the night
And morning brings forth
All this wonderful delight
Couldn't have made it more plain
When I heard that soft refrain
And I heard you gently sigh
Wanna take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly
Lie in the dark
With the sound of the nightingale
Listen for a lark
I will tell you a tale
Breeze is blowin', blowin' outside
Wanna take that moonlight ride
When I hear you gently sigh
Wanna take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly
Well we're here and we're waiting
For that morning light to shine
And I'm looking at you looking at me looking right back at you
And I'm anticipating
Sounds along the way
Looking at you looking at me looking right back at you, hey
I'll follow the road
That will take me, take me right back home
And carry that load
Where the deer and the provincial angels roam
Happiness touches, touches me now
I know where it came from and how
When I hear you gently sigh
Wanna take you where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky
That's where flamingos fly, flamingos fly
Way over the rooftops of the houses
I heard it one time, I heard it one time in a lullaby
I heard it one time, I heard it one time in a lullaby
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere way over the rooftops of the houses
Heard it one time in a lullaby
Heard it one time, heard it one time in a lullaby

Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, 'nother night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Lonely nights echo your name
Oh, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah! When you see me smiling
You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling
Makes me feel half alive
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

[Chorus x2]
Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night
It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front
[Chorus x2]
Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot
And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's
[Chorus x2]
And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you
[Chorus x2]
See me riding real slick thick and rolling on thangs
Got the misses and the bitches want to know my name
They want to know what I'm on
Get the fuck up out of mine homie go on and get your own
Riding slick with the cherry wood grain
In my big boy truck with the candy paint
Why, bitches giving me brain
I know you want to ball like me but you can't
Stay the fuck up out my business man
[Chorus]

When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your f me pumps
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to
'Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
'Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife
You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller
You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed
You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller
You can't sit down right
'Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers
So you did Miami
'Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane
Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me
'Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps

Help my sister, did you make a mistake?
There's life and you're pally and it's too much to take
Hey there, my friend, I heard of your dad
He was a hero and the towers were crashed
(I am one)
And I'm reaching for you
(I am one)
And together we're two
I'll be your strings and I won't let you fall
And together we'll find one more
Hey little girl, little Indian girl
Can I give you some bread and the peace of my world?
Look to my fingers, there's hope in my hands
Come to my pocket and I'll give what I can
(I am one)
And I'm reaching for you
(I am one)
And together we're two
I'll be your strings and I won't let you fall
And together we'll find one more
If one can do anything
Then two can change the world
If one can make a difference
Then together we're so much more
There was a flood not long ago
It took my people and it tattered my soul
(I am one)
And I'm reaching for you
(I am one)
And together we're two
I'll be your strings and I won't let you fall
You may not have much
But alone I am one without you

Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Now you say you've found someone you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes

Mmmmm, Lawdy, lawdy, lawd
Mmmmm, Lawdy, lawdy, lawd
The woman I love treats me just like a dog
I love you baby but your ways I just can't stand
I love you mama but your ways I just can't stand
Say, you walked away and left me good girl, with another man
Goin back to Savannah mama, sign my initials down
Goin back to Savannah mama, sign my initials down
Atlanta mens all hate me mama, and the women don't want me round
Goin back to Savannah baby, write my initials on the wall
Goin back to Savannah mama, write my initials on the wall
Cause you know Georgia women don't mean me no good at all
Play that thing low and lonesome boy
Mmmmm, baby it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
Aah, baby ain't it hard, ain't it hard, ain't it hard
I'd like to love you baby but your good man's got me barred

I confess
From the bottom of my heart
Loneliness
Was tearing me apart
What a mess
Going on in my mind
Took a step
Didn't know what I would find
And then there you were, oh, oh
Watching me
How could I know, oh, oh
New me, it's got to be
Don't let go, stay with me
Cause baby we, both know
That was it, we were hip
So bring the rain let it fall on me
Guide me save in your arms
Beautiful day let it dawn on me
Open my eyes to the sun
Time is too still
Looking for a reason why
What was real
Was right before my eyes
Face to face
With the fire in my heart
In this place, where love want's to spark
And then there you were, oh, oh
Watching me
How could I know, oh, oh
New me, it's got to be
Don't let go, stay with me
Cause baby we, both know
That was it, we were hip.
So bring the rain let it fall on me
Guide me save in your arms
Beautiful day let it dawn on me
Open my eyes to the sun
Whether is attraction
Love will find a way
It's a chain reaction
Love will find a way
Whether is attraction
Love will find a way
It's a chain reaction
Love will find a way
So bring the rain let it fall on me
Guide me save in your arms
Beautiful day let it dawn on me
Open my eyes to the sun
(Beautiful day let it dawn on me)
(Put me save in your arms)
(Let it rain)
(Let it rain)
(Let it rain)

Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.
Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.
I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true
Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.
I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

It's the last fair deal gone down
It's the last fair deal gone down
It's the last fair deal gone down, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road
Please, Ida Belle, don't cry
Ida Belle, don't cry this time
If you cry 'bout a nickel, you'll die 'bout a dime
She won't cry, but the money won't be mine
I love the way You do
I love the way You do
I love the way You do, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
The captain ain't here at sea
The captain ain't here at sea
The captain is gone, ain't seen, good Lord
On the Gulfport Island Road
Oh, it's the last fair deal gone down
The last fair deal gone down
The last fair deal gone down, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
I'm workin' my way back home
I'm workin' my way back home
I'm workin' my way back home, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
And that thing don't keep ringin' so soon, no
That thing don't keep ringin' so soon
That thing don't keep ringin' so soon
Good Lord, on that Gulfport Island Road

It happened to me
On a trip to the West Indies
Oh, I'm all at sea
Since that trip to the West Indies
I'm jittery
I'm twittery
I guess I'm done for
I guess I'm through
And it's something about which there's nothing anyone can do
It isn't love
It isn't money trouble
It's a very funny trouble:
It's just another rhumba
But it certainly has my numb-bah
So much so, that I can't eat or slum-bah
Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
Why did I have to plan a
Vacation in Havana?
Why did I take that trip
That made me lose my grip?
Oh! That piece of music laid me low
There it goes again:
Just another rhumba
Which I heard only last Septum-bah
I'm a wreck, why did I have to succumb-bah
Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
Why did I have to succumb-bah
To that rhumba?
I'm the cucaracha, who just went blah
And gave up swinging ha-cha, ahah
At first it was devine-ah
But it turned out a Cuban Frankenstein-ah
It's got me by the throat-ah!
Oh, what's the antidote-ah?
It brought me woe and strife-ah
Oh, where's a gun or knife-ah?
It's the rhumba that blighted my life
There it goes again
Just another rhumba
But it certainly has my numb-bah
So much so, that I can't eat or slum-bah
Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
Why did I have to succumb-bah
To that rhumba?
There it goes again
Just another rhumba
But it certainly has my numb-bah
So much so, that I can't eat or slum-bah
Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
Why did I have to succumb-bah
To that rhumba?

Send her your love with a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it with a flower from your heart
Show him your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's straight from your heart
I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
Waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion
Send her your love with a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it with a flower from your heart
Show him your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's straight from the heart
I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory
Send one your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's coming from your heart, whoa whoa
From your heart, whoa whoa, from your heart, whoa whoa
Send one your love, show him your love
Send one your love, your love

Such a bad thing to run away from my mother
Right into the arms of a lover
I should walk away from you in my brand new shoes
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
I'm a baby, and your kiss is so tender
I'm a big fool if I ever surrender
I'll come back some day when I learn the rules
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart
So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
Why play if the blues is the winner
If I stick around I know I'll lose
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart
So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
Why play if the blues is the winner
If I stick around I know I'll lose
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
Just too young, too young for the blues.

Vieni su, vieni su, vieni
Come along through the years with me
Can't you see how I adore you
And how long I waited for you
Vieni su, vieni su
Won't you say you love me too
Can't you see how much I adore you
And how long I waited for you
Vieni su, vieni su
Won't you say you love me too

Like the wings of a bird
My heart soaring way up high
Under the moon and over the sky
A man and a women
A love that could never die
Under the moon and over the sky
The universe is waiting for you
To live a life
That's happy and free
Let's all go out
And reach for the sun
Happiness and love could be for everyone
If we just try a little harder
Like the wings of a bird
My heart soaring way up high
Under the moon and over the sky
Under the moon and over the sky
Under the moon and over the sky
Under the moon and over the sky

I went down to my friend's house

Little did we know the day we said hello
That you'd be the one for me
Little did we dream our hearts would play a theme
That soon was a symphony
Little did we know one sweet caress
Would lead the way to happiness
Yes, little did we know the love we'd share
That now we'd know how much we care
Little did we guess one sweet caress
Would lead the way to happiness
Yes, little did we know the love we'd share
But now we know how much we care

Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

My Baby's got way, I just can't understand
My Baby's got way, I just can't understand
Leaves me in the mornin', goes with another man
I said, "Baby, baby please come back to me"
I said, "Baby, baby please come back to me"
I'll make you as happy, as my little girl can be
My baby's got something that shines like the risin' sun
My baby's got something that shines like the risin' sun
You're the sweetest thing, I have ever seen
Wake up in the mornin', my love has just begun
Wake up in the mornin', love my baby all night
Hold my baby in my arms, and love her all this night
I gotta rock my baby right, rock my baby tight
Gotta rock my baby, rock my baby,
Rock my baby, rock my baby all night

Sometimes I wonder
Just what am I fighting for?
I win some battles
But I always lose the war
I keep right on stumblin'
In this no-man's land out here
But I know
Mm yes, I know
There must be a better world somewhere
Flying high
Some joker clips my wings
Just because he gets a kick
Out of doing those kind of things
I keep on fallin' in space
Or just hangin' in mid-air
But I know
Oh yes, I know
There has just got to be a better world somewhere
Every woman I want
Only wants herself
Everybody I love
Seems to love somebody else
And every woman
Got a license to break my heart
And every love, oh it's over
Over before it gets a chance to start
If it ain't dead
Maybe in the year after
Instead of tears
I'll learn all about laughter
But meanwhile I'm stuck out here
It just ain't fair, but I know
I said I know
Oh yes, I know
There must be a better world somewhere
There's just gotta be
Gotta be a better world somewhere

Call me irresponsible, call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you?
Well, I'm not too clever; I just adore you
Call me unpredictable, tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
Call me irresponsible; yes, I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true: I'm irresponsibly mad for you

When the days are sad and long,
I just keep wandering on,
To the place I hear a call,
Because the one I love is there;
Back to the fields of cotton
To hear a Creole love song.

Shake down the stars, pull down the clouds
Turn off the moon, do it soon
I can't enjoy this night without you
Shake down the stars
Dry up the streams
Stop all my dreams.
Cut off the breeze, do it please
I never thought I'd cry about you
Shake down the stars
I gave you my arms, my lips, my heart
My love, my life, my all
But the best that I had to offer you
I found was all too small
Crush every rose, hush ev'ry prayer
Break every vow, do it now
I know I can't go on without you
Shake down the stars

In the dark of deepest night
There comes a haunting sigh
Floating down from somewhere on high
Oh, what a lonely lullaby
You'll hear a symphony in blue
Whenever boy meets horn
You'll hear a melody so new
When boy meets horn
Low and, oh
So sweet that it seems
It's like the mellow music from
Another world of dreams
You'll hear a strange and tender
Whenever boy meets horn
And when the music in the moonlight
Greets the morn
You'll see him standing way above
The crowd and rockin' on a cloud
Whenever boy meets horn
You'll hear a symphony in blue
When ever boy meets horn
You'll hear a melody so new
When boy meets horn
Low and, oh
So sweet that it seems
It's like the mellow music from
Another world of dreams
You'll hear a strange and tender
Whenever boy meets horn
And when the music in the moonlight
Greets the morn
You'll see him standing way above
The crowd and rockin' on a cloud
Whenever boy meets horn

A
Dark folk, white folk, but never a hand,
They say to this man,
"You're yaller, you're yaller, you're yaller, you're just a yaller."
A
Black folk, white folk, I'm learning a lot,
You know what I am, I know what I'm not,
be
Ain't even black, I ain't even white,
I ain't like the day and I ain't like the night.
Feeling mean, so inbetween, I'm just a high yaller.
be
Ain't even bad, I ain't even good,
I don't understand and I ain't understood,
Not a friend sticks to the end when you're yaller.
see
Take me to a church and make me pray,
Make me sing a psalm there;
You better leave my soul in a crude cafe,
I don't even belong there.
be
Oh Lord, can't you make a sinner a saint,
Why did you start me but run out of paint,
Pass me by, a no-'count yellow man.
be
Lord only knows, I'm trying to rest,
I want to be down with a load on my chest.
Make my bed; wish I were dead,
A yaller man.

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
Smile through your tears, laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Smile through your tears, laugh at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

They got me 'cused for murder and I haven't even harmed a
Man
They got me 'cused for murder but I haven't even harmed a
Man
They got me charged with burglin' and I haven't even
Raised my hand
The judge won't give me no fine
The judge won't give me no fine
Ain't but one thing could release me and that's so far
Beside
I'll have to give you my number, 5994
I'll have to give your my number, 5994
Because I'll be there forever, I've have no other place
To go
They got me 'cused for forging and I can't even write my
Name
Well they got me 'cused of forging and I can't even write
My name
And my eyes still don't miss, my baby left my poor heart
In pain
My baby left my heart in pain

What do you do with an empty heart?
Would you die at this moment?
Would you break down and cry out, for the one you love?
Would you change your ways, to make him happy?
Would you drop everything, to be with the man you love?
Ideas, dreams, fantisies
Drifting within space
Silenced, I
Longing to be held
Longing to be touched
Longing to be admired
What would you do with an empty heart?
To what extent would you go, to have him back in your life?
Would you jump out a plane?
Would you bend over backwords to win his love?
Would you give him all your worldly possessions, to be with your only true love?
Hands, skin, lips, tongue
Silenced, I am
Wanting, needing, desiring
To be told I am loved
To be cared for
That he respects my needs
That he encourages my dreams
Love hurts in many places
In darkness and light,
It has many phases.
We break up to make up
We take chances
Words go spinning inside
Of an empty heart and
Closed a mind
An empty heart
Caressing voices cry inside my head
I fear the pain of losing
I regret the pain
I pray for forgiveness
Words spinning inside
An empty heart and mind
What would you do with an empty heart?
Is love worth fighting for?
Is love worth dying for?
What do you do with an empty heart?
All love burns inside
Broken of
Ideas
Fantisies
Dreams
Love burns

Take a trip
And trip inside your mind from where you are
Make a wish
And wish upon a star from near or far
I keep hopin' for a dream
I keep searchin' for the mircale in you
You can feel your destiny
If you hold on tight the dream will carry you
Trippin' through your mind yeah
Trippin' through your mind yeah
Your mind
In your mind
Close your eyes
And let your spirit fly from where you are
Take the time
To purify your mind from where you are
I keep hopin' for a dream
I keep searchin' for the miracle in you
You can feel the destiny
If you hold on tight the dream will carry you
Trippin' through your mind yeah
Trippin' through your mind yeah
Your mind
Through your mind
Through your mind
Through your mind...

Rustling of the leaves used to be my lullaby
In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
And now that I have grown
And myself alone
Cradle me where Southern skies
Can watch me with a million eyes
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves
Cover me with heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves
I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song through the trees
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That fine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

When troubles get me, cares beset me
And won't let me go,
I turn to you for consolation.
There I find new peace of mind;
To leave behind my woe
I turn to you as I shall always do.
[Chorus]
The touch of your lips upon my brow,
Your lips that are cool and sweet,
Such tenderness lies in their soft caress,
My heart forgets to beat.
The touch of your hands upon my head,
The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.
The touch of your hands upon my head,
The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.

I got myself a hat with cherries
And a brand new yellow dress
It isn't very hard to guess
That the answer will be yes
I'm ridin' high
And I approve of the trend
Look what I've found me
I got myself a gentleman friend
The sunny sky
Seems like it never will end
When he's around me
I'm referrin' to my gentleman friend
His kind o' kissin' suits me to a T
What I was missin' in the use to be
I'm gettin' frequently
And so goodbye to cares that hound me
Is it any wonder I
Wanna laugh and sing and cry
Gonna love him 'til I die
My gentleman friend
[Piano & Guitar solos]
His kind o' kissin' suits me to a T
What I was missin' in the use to be
I'm gettin' frequently
And so goodbye to cares that hound me
Is it any wonder I
Wanna laugh and sing and cry
Gonna love him 'til I die
My gentleman friend

Too search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are
You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean they just aren't swell enough
You're much too much
And just to very, very
To ever be
In Webster's dictionary
And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words
You're much too much
And just to very, very
To ever be
In Webster's dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words

If I knew then what I know now
If I knew then you'd be here right now
I'd trade the world and its gold
To have and to hold the one thing in life I love
If I knew then, oh, what I know now
We would never have drifted apart
If I had only taken your dream and made it part of mine
If I knew then, oh, what I know now
If I knew then, oh, what I know now
We would never have drifted apart
If I had only taken your dream, made it part of mine
If I knew then what I know now

There's a crow flying
Dark and ragged
Tree to tree
he's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky
I took a ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How'm I ever going to know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue, blue sky
In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving, diving, diving, diving
Diving down to pick up on every shining thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky
I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a black crow flying
In a blue sky
Oh I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue sky

No pennies from heaven, no pennies in my hand
Think your drinkin' wine, Dad, it's blood of the lamb
That's no way to treat your son now is it, Abraham
After he busted his ass for you
You've never known no hunger, never took a risk
Through you know you should, you know you'd never raise a fist
If the boss asked you to jump you know
You'd find the nearest cliff
That man talks down to you
And you talk down to me too now
Master and Slave in equal parts
split down the middle,
drinkin' doubles at the bar
Master and Slave,
God bless you both
I got two for the price of one
Master and Slave in equal parts
split down the middle,
drinkin' doubles at the bar
Master and Slave,
God bless you both
I got two for the price of one
Such a deal for your only son
When will this tension be all over
For fallen sons and fathers too
I'm down to my last dime
No faith in mankind
c'mon let's swing into the groove...
Like Jack Horner wrapped up in a corner
But I never saw a slice of no pie
Ooh, too busy standin' in line
Just waitin' for bread
But the father he walks the water
He ain't never tossed a nickel to his son
Ain't I your prodigal boy?
Ain't I your pride and joy?
Friends and Romans, I'm your brother
I'm scratchin' to hang on
The pursuit of happiness is just a carpetbaggers con
When a can of pork and beans could change my attitude
You won't give it up but I coulda been you
While the masters and slaves scratch
For pieces of the dream
For purple mountain majesties
Whatever the hell that means
They give up on each other
And that's the way they get ahead
But I can still see the stars
Through these red, white, and blue prison bars
Master and Slave in equal parts
split down the middle,
drinkin' doubles at the bar
Master and Slave,
God bless you both
I got two for the price of one
Master and Slave in equal parts
split down the middle,
drinkin' doubles at the bar
Master and Slave,
God bless you both
I got two for the price of one
Such a deal for your only son
Master and slave
Master and slave
Ooh, Master and slave

I've got a lovesick tale to tell to you
Though it ain't no affair of mine
It's 'bout a gal named Sue and a boy named Lou
They were fighting all the time
Sue came home one afternoon
And found an empty dining room
Without a word her turtledove had flown
She began to moan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when, he didn't say why
Oh, bid me goodbye
I'm blue as I can be
I know he loved another one but he didn't say who
He didn't say when, he didn't say what
His mama has got
That took my sweetie from me
I'm like a little lost sheep
And I can't sleep
But I keep trying to forget
My trifling papa has left his mama all alone, I groan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when, he didn't say why
I know I'll die
Why don't he hurry home

I can't forget the night you told me that you loved me
The stars were shining so bright
How could I constantly resist you when you're lips were sweet
And your arms held me tight
You said you'd give me your heart
But you just lied to me from the start
Won't you please, please stop pretending
And just say goodbye
No, I won't sigh and I won't cry
You're not my guy, just say goodbye
I can't forget how soft you're voice was when you told me
You needed my sweet caress
And when you begged me for my love I though at last I found
My whole life's happiness
You said you'd give me your heart
But you just lied to me from the start
Won't you please, please stop pretending
And just say goodbye
No, I won't sigh and I won't cry
You're not my guy, just say goodbye, just say goodbye
You're not my guy, so just say goodbye

A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon and two hearts in tune in some lullaby land
The fireflies' gleam reflects in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees all dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples
We're deep in a spell as nightingales tell
Of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon,
And you
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon,
And you
La-da-da-da-da,
Ha-ah-ah-ah-ah,
A sleepy lagoon, and you.

Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Please say you'll be mine
Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Please say that you'll be mine
Every time I see you
Cold chills run down my spine
Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Really knocks me off my feet
Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Really knocks me off my feet
I love the way you twist when
You're strolling down the street
Well, Sugar baby
Please show me a sign
Sugar baby, come on
Show me a sign
Come on, Sugar baby
Place your lips to mine
Yeah
Oh, Sugar baby
Come on, show me a sign
Oh, Sugar baby
Come on, show me a sign
Come on, Sugar baby
And place your lips to mine
Yeah

Won't you play some simple melody
Like my mother sang to me?
One with a good old fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody
Musical demon, set your honey a dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag
Musical demon, set your honey a dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause

Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag
Play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all of my applause because
I wanna rag it, ragtime melody

I'm trying to explain to friends, dear
The reasons we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends, dear
But what can I tell my heart?
It's easy to say to strangers
That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?
[Chorus:]
When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring
I'm telling you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?
[Chorus]
I could say that you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all,
what's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
'cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
and you're gonna shake me down somehow,
so what's the use, you've cooked my goose
'cause you took advantage of me.
I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
my elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
and much worse when you're near.
Here I am with all my bridges burned,
just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
so lock the doors and call me yours
'cause you took advantage of me.

For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love, love is a losing hand
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
"If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies."
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigalette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered dreams
And gigolo and gigalette
Awake to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigalette
Still sing a song and dance along
Boulevard of broken dreams

The preacher went out a huntin', it was on one Sunday morn'
It was against his religion, but he took a shotgun along
He got himself a mess o' mighty fine quail and one old scraggly hare
And on the way home he crossed the path of a great big grizzly bear
Well the bear got down lookin' ready to charge
The preacher never seen nothin' quite that large
They looked each other right smack in the eye
Didn't take that preacher long to say bye
The preacher, he run till he spotted a tree
He said, "Up in that tree's where I oughta be"
By the time that bear made a grab for him
The preacher was a sittin' on top a that limb
Scared to death, he turned about
He looked to the sky and began to shout
"Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace
So the good books do declare
Hey lord, if you can't help me,
For goodness sake don't help that bear"
Yea, look out preacher!
Well, about that time the limb broke off
And the preacher came tumblin' down
Had a straight razor out of his pocket
By the time he lit on the ground
He landed on his feet right in front a that bear
And Lord, what an awful fight
The preacher and the bear and the razor and the hair
Flyin' from left to right
Well first they was up and then they was down
The preacher and the bear runnin' round an' round
The bear he roared, and the the preacher he groaned
He was havin' a tough time holdin' his own!
He said, "Lord if I get out a here alive
To the good book I'll abide
No more huntin' on the Sabbath day
Come Sunday I'm headin' to the church to pray"
Up to the heavens the preacher glanced
He said, "Lord won't you give me just one more chance"
So the preacher got away, he looked around
Seen a tree where he'd be safe and sound
Jumped on a limb, turned about
Looked to the sky and began to shout
"Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace
So the good books do declare
Hey lord, if you can't help me,
For goodness sake don't help that bear"

You ought to know by now
Love is the look in my eye
Lovin' the way you smile
When I say
"I wish you would stay"
You bring out all the youth in me
I laugh and cry out all the truth in me out of love
You should know by now
Haven't you felt by now
Just what it's like to be loved
Knowing that certain touch when you're sure
Time won't give you more
You bring out all the best in me
I want to hold you till you feel the need
Somehow
You should know by now
If I could just find the words
I wouldn't be left so lonely
I'm you're my one and only
And I'd show you how
Every move as smooth as silk
Say you will
Stay you will
Hasn't it crossed your mind?
Haven't you known all the time?
Honestly tell me now has it shown?
How much love is grown?
The way I tremble at the sight of you
I want to learn to love you through and through
This I'll vow
You should know by now
Hmm by now
You should by now
Don't you think you should know by now?

Dixie moonlight, Swanee shore
Headed homebound just once more
To my Mississippi delta home
Southland has that grand garden spot
Although you believe or not
I hear those breeze a-whispering:
"Come on back to me"
Muddy water 'round my feet
Muddy water in the street
Just God don't shelter
Down on the delta
Muddy water in my shoes
Reeling and rocking to them lowdown blues
They live in ease and comfort down there
I do declare

I smell a rat, baby
I smell a rat, baby
You'd better watch out
I smell a rat
You won't tell me where you been
Whiskey running all down your chin
I smell a rat, baby
I smell a rat, baby
You'd better watch out
I smell a rat, baby
You come stumbling down the hall
Bump your head up against the wall
Knock down drunk, that ain't all
I know you been having yourself a ball
I smell a rat, baby
I smell a rat, baby
You'd better watch out
I smell a rat, baby
You'd better catch up with some of those rats, baby
'Cause I smell it
Ah, I know you ain't nothing but a old big ole' warf rat
Ah, you'd better watch those rats running under your foot boy,
They're gonna get ya
Ah, I smell a rat

Peel me a grape
Crush me some ice
Skin me a peach
Save the fuzz for my pillow
Start me a smoke
Talk to me nice
You gotta wine me
And dine me
Don't try and train me
Chow mein me
Best way to serve me
Hors d'oeuvre me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape
Pop me a cork
French me a fry
Crack me a nut
Bring a bowl fulla bonbons
Chill me some wine
Keep standing by
Just entertain me
Champagne me
Best way to cheer me
Cashmere me
Best way to smell me
Chanel me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape
Here's how to be an agreeable chap
Love me and leave me in luxury's lap
Hop when I holler
Skip when I snap
When I say `do it'
Jump to it
Send out for Scotch
Call me a cab
Cut me a rose
Make my tea with the petals
Just hang around
Pick up the tab
Never outthink me
Just mink me
Polar bear rug me
Don't bug me
New Thunderbird me
You heard me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape

Here while the day is fading,
Dear you I'm serenading,
My love you've been evading,
No wonder I am blue...Oh listen to my pleading,
Your nearness I am needing,
It's time that you were heeding,
My offering to you...We` Marie, we` Marie,
Quanto sonno agiu perso per te,
Famme` durmi, Una notte abbraciata cu te,
We` Marie, we` Marie,
Quanto sonno agiu perse per te,
Famme` durmi, we` Marie, we` Marie..
We` Marie, we` Marie,
Quanto sonno agiu perse per te,
Famme` durmi, we` Marie, we` Marie!

Give me a kiss to build on and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
Weaving romances, making believe they're true
Give me your lips for just a moment and my
Imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on

Oh the holy earth's a mural
seen from way up high
abstracted natural bas-relief
witnessed from the sky
clouds that cast a single shadow
drifting moving on the ground
creating an illusion
as the world goes round
Places where the folks inhabit
have a geometric grace
circles, squares, sometimes triangles
rules and lines in space
waterways and craggy mountains
seemingly reveal a plan
just as if somebody drew it
with a great big giant hand
Life's a repetition
it's an action of repeat
act of doing, act of saying
something bitter, something sweet
acts of life that keep occurring
ghosts appearing through the sound
waving at us from a distance
'cause the whole wide world is round and round and round and round
the whole wide world is round
Generations generating
bring the people here en masse
living in a world where
everybody's second class
forming moving in a circle
ghosts appearing through the sound
waving at us from a distance
cause the whole wide world is round and round and round and round
the whole wide world is round
People here before us
leave their memories behind
actions done and actions written
acts impressed upon our mind
forming moving in a circle
ghosts appearing through the sound
waving at us from a distance
cause the whole wide world is round and round and round and round
the whole wide world is round
Round and round and round and round
the whole wide world is round

I feel you moving, slipping away
I try to call, but I can't find the
words to say
My lips move, ah but they don't make a sound
I hear your voice baby, but you're nowhere around
I close my eyes, I can't find my sleep
My wounds will not heal, you cut me too deep
My mind is strong but my spirit is weak
I got to get back on my feet
Well, you can be so cruel
Oh, that I just don't understand
Do the tears that I cry baby
Hey, does it make you feel like a man
And I told you once boy,
Oh baby let me tell you again
You can't do right cause you're the
Wrong man
Chorus:
You're the wrong man
You're the wrong man
You're the wrong man
I hear you calling, but I ain't no fool
I've got to be stronger
I've got to get over you
Each time I cry, its a sign of my pain
Every tear that falls, carries your name
All I know is it cannot go on
Everything I do for you is wrong
Ain't nothing I can say or can do
I just got to, I gotta get up child
I gotta move
Hear me baby
Tell me what you want me to do
Ain't my, my my my, ain't my lovin good enough for you
I told you once boy, baby lemme tell you again
You can't do right cause...
(Chorus)
You know I love you
But sometimes love ain't enough
And I don't wanna leave you
Baby but I'm giving you up
And I told you once boy
And I don't wanna tell you again
You can't do right cause
You're the wrong man
You can't do right baby
You can't do right baby
I'd rather lose you child
Than to lose my mind, yeah
Said I'd rather lose you, child
Thann to lose my mind

Empty out the cash
Count what you have left
Take from me all that you can get
And leave me here in debt
I never gave to be repaid
When I thought my love was safe
But see me now, Ive nothing left to give you
You broke the bank, and broke a heart in two
The time to say youre sorry came and went
You say youll pay me back, plus the rent
But I think youre spent
So you can keep the change
Although my pockets are empty (You should know)
Its not the money that I miss, no
Cause thats not what I paid with
(But, I guess were bound by)
Unspoken rules
Youll never read
In love there is (You never get something for nothing)
No selfless deed (Cause nobody does nothing for free)
We spend emotion
Its a currency that we burn
To get love in return
But see me now, Ive nothing left to give you
You broke the bank, and broke a heart in two
The time to say youre sorry came and went
You say youll pay me back, plus the rent
But I think youre spent
I think were spent
The sharing straws, and films we saw
I gave it all, but no more
Investment made but no remains
And not single penny saved
Not a single penny

Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down
Said yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty heck into that district court
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read murder in the first degree
I hollered Lawdy Lawdy, have a mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I want to stay here
With you forever
And I'll be glad
I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands
If you can keep me
I want to stay here
With you forever
I've got my man
Someday I know he's coming
Back to call me
He's gonna handle me
And hold me so
It's going to be like dying, Porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes, I know
I'll have to go
I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I want to stay here
With you forever
I've got my man

Spider weaves a spit green sea
That tangles up and drowns the fly -- poor fly
Well, he's got pneumonia just like me
But he can't swim as well as I
And I realized as I watched him die
Near this bed of mine
There was a secret to vision, a fairy tale madness
Rise on mercury pearl
I was strangled in the blankets sweatin'
Fightin' for my poor short life -- poor fly
Floating infinitesemal I felt it bloom with graceful eyes
And I said good-bye to my future joys
Lying mummified.
There was a secret to vision, a fairy tale madness
Rise on mercury pearl
Steam heater hissing, grandma is kissing,
Staring at my box of colored chalk
The thermometer shaking
Fear is breaking
Comin' down like Jack from his bean stalk
Thus my little room became the cocoon
For my senses five.
There was a secret to vision, a fairy tale madness
Rise on mercury pearl
Rise on mercury I'm here to give you my world.

I've been trying to get to you for a long time
'Cause constantly you've been on my mind
I was thinking 'bout a short cut that I could take
But I found I made a mistake
I was wrong
It took too long
I got caught in a rush hour
Fellows started to shower
you with love and affection
Now you won't look at my direction
On the expressway to your heart
That expressway that's the best way
At five o'clock it's much too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Too crowded for me
Couldn't get through to you baby
Oh, it's too crowded
Well they're too many in back of me
And they're all tryin' to get in front of me
I was thinking I saw a road up ahead
But I saw a stoplight instead
I was wrong
It took too long
I got caught in a rush hour
Fellows started to shower
you with love and affection
Now you won't look at my direction
On the expressway to your heart
That expressway that's the best way
I was wrong
It took too long
I got caught a rush hour
Fellows started to shower
you with love and affection
Now you won't look at my direction
On the expressway to your heart
That expressway that's the best way
That expressway to your heart
That espressway that's the best way
At five o'clock it's too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Much too crowded (Too crowded)
Too crowded
Too crowded for me
Just couldn't get through baby
Oh, oh, oh, much too crowded
Oh, oh, oh, much too crowded

The girl I dream about
Someday she will appear
The girl I dream about
Her face is oh so clear
Are you real or is it just my imagination
The way I feel defies a logical explanation
The girl I dream about
The love I've waited for
I know her inside out
The one that I adore
I never thought that dreams came true
The girl I dream about
Baby is you

said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your lovin' man has gone
hear what I say
Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back to fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And I won't be back to fall
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all
Hear what I say, I said

Well I've got a good reason for lovin' you
It's an old fashioned sign
It kinda makes me feel like, mmm
You know, when I fell in love the first time
Kind woman, won't you love me tonight
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Are you sayin' it's all right
Well remember once before
Hearin' the old folks say love's an ageless old rhyme
Yeah but nowadays you know the sayin' depends
So much on the kind of woman that you find
Kind woman, won't you love me tonight
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right

Somebody stole my girll
Somebody stole my pal
Somebody came and took her away
She didn't even say that she was leavin'
Her kisses I love so
He's gettin' now I know
And gee, I know that she would come to me
If she could see, her broken hearted i am just a lonesome pal
Somebody stole my gal

A sailboat in the moonlight and you
Wouldn't that be heaven
A heaven just for two
A soft breeze on a June night and you
What a perfect setting
For letting dreams come true
A chance to sail away
To Sweetheart Bay
Beneath the stars that shine
A chance to drift
For you to lift
Your tender lips to mine
Some things dear
That I long for are few
Just give me a sailboat
In the moonlight and you
A chance to sail away
To Sweetheart Bay
Beneath the stars that shine
A chance to drift
For you to lift
Your tender lips to mine
Some things dear
That I long for are few
Just give me a sailboat
In the moonlight and you

Well it's three o'clock in the morning' ya'll
Oh, and I'm biding my time
Give me two more Mr. Waiter
You know I got a whole lot on my mind
Going back to Louisiana,
To that girl left behind
I been to Memphis baby, I been to Kansas City too
Never met a woman who could love me like you do
Going back to Louisiana,
To that girl I left behind
Yeah, she's my kind of woman ya'll
She's just my size
Knocks me out the way she looks me in the eyes
Going back to Louisiana,
To that girl I left behind
She used to live in Shreveport,
But then she moved
Bet you ten to one she's going to Baton Rouge
I'm gonna look her up, if you know what I mean
If I have to go as far as New Orleans
Been fine talking to ya honey but,
You know that I
Got to find my baby, got to move on down the line
Going back to Louisiana,
To that girl I left behind
She used to live in Shreveport,
But then she moved
Bet you ten to one she's going to Baton Rouge
I'm gonna look her up, if you know what I mean
If I have to go as far as New Orleans
Been fine talking to ya honey but,
You know that I
Got to find my baby, got to move on down the line
Going back to Louisiana,
To that girl I left behind
Oh, yeah, I'm going back to Louisiana
To that girl I left behind

You know I love you girl?
I apologies, it's been too long
Yeah, I know it you don't mean it when you act a mess
Yeah, that's your ego filling up your pictures
Just rub me, wrong me and walk away, some flowers later
Pop bottles later, I still can't hate you
But I act like you know I'm fire, make no mistakes
I don't ride with you, pushing me, baby, poppin' breaks
I'm equal, I'm half of you
That ego don't look good on you
I normally don't talk like this, I'll let you leave
You usually walk beside me, not in front of me
I got bigger problems, independent in my nature
Pop bottles later, I still can't hate you
But I act like you know I'm fire, make no mistakes
I don't ride with you, pushing me, baby, poppin' breaks
I'm equal, I'm half of you
That ego don't look good on you
I've been in love with you for six years, since Aston Martin Music
Drizzy came behind you on that smooth shit
So iconic with the wordplay,
It's ironic coming first place
I'm still the plug, champagne, making love
On a beach waking up, all your friends says luck
I just really think it's us, and we're never breaking up
Oh, that [?] cold game, but I see swan
Let it shine to the least born
Had to take you shopping at the each mall
So I told her how to move, no forever 21
No, DMG, racing Lamborghini always come back in fourth place
Now we're back on this love twist
Fat Boy always fall in love quick
I'm your equal, I'm your equal, I'm your equal
(It's been too long)
No more you, no more you, no more you
(I apologies)
I'm your equal, I'm your equal, I'm your equal
No more you, no more you, no more you

Daydream, why do you haunt me so
Deep in a rosy glow
The face of my love you show
Daydream, I walk along on air
Building a castle there
For me and my love to share
Don't know the time, lordy
I'm in a daze
Sun in the sky, while I moon around, feeling, hazy
Daydream, don't break my reverie
Until I find that he,
Is daydreaming just like me

Speak softly love
And hold me warm against your heart.
I feel your words
The tender
Trembling moments start.
We're a world our very own
Sharing a love that only few have ever known.
Wine colored days warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one
Speak softly love
So no one hears us but the sky.
The vows of love we make will live until we die.
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love so softly
Love.

{Only some of verses}
Light rain fallin', light rain fallin'
Light rain blowin' in the air
{Repeat first 2 lines}
Tell me, tell me mama....
Is it blowin' in my sweet baby's hair
We used to walk together now
When the world was fresh & green
{Repeat first 2 lines}
Now it seems like dried grass
Is all in the world I've ever seen
Seems like the world's on fire now....
Not a cloud up in the sky
{Repeat first 2 lines}
Yeah, the world's like a desert
Where the waterhole's gone dry
Oh green grass, green grass, green grass
You were born upon a rainy day
{Repeat first 2 lines}
Your daddy was a light rain, your mama was the month of May.
{Repeat Verse One}

Supper time
I should set the table
'Cause it's supper time
Somehow I'm not able
'Cause that man o'mine
Ain't comin' home no more
Supper time
Kids will soon be yellin'
For their supper time
How'll I keep from tellin'
Them that man o'mine
Ain't comin' home no more?
How'll I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone?
How'll I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on?
How can I remind them to pray at their humble board?
How can I be thankful when they start to thank the lord
Lord!
Supper time
I should set the table
'Cause it's supper time
Somehow I'm not able
'Cause that man o'mine
Ain't comin' home no more

Look out!
You ready for this?
Who's that comin' down the thoroughfare
The sunshine flashin' on his ring
Bowin' left and right and here and there
That's Chester, the trombone king
He gets his shirts straight from Paris
Cigarettes from the Nile
He tallks like a 'eyebrow', but he plays Chicago style
He gets his shoes made in London
And they're real crocodile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
And he sometimes plays sweet
Hup-toodle-oodle-oodle-dee-ooo
But sweet or hot, he's always got
That real gut-bucket beat
He's got a neat Latin moustache
And the girls love his smile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
A trombone made in Newark
Played in Chicago style
Chicago style
Chicago style
He gets his neckties from Naples
And his socks from Argyle
Speaks Oxford English, but he plays Chicago style
Wears a stickpin from Rio, are you listenin'
You can see it for a mile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
And he sometimes plays sweet
Uncle Jake's weary blues
But sweet or hot, he's always got
That real gut-bucket beat
He likes New York for the Opera
And gets two on the aisle
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
A trombone made in Newark
Played in Chicago style
Yes sir
Hey-hey
A trombone played Chicago style

You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was
Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me
You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was
Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Stardust gleamin'
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion,
You're a blue illusion
While I'm in this Azure interlude.
I'm not wanted I'm so all alone;
Always haunted
By the dreams I own;
But, though Im tormented
I must be contented
Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood!
Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Star dust gleamin'
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion,
You're a blue illusion
While I'm in this Azure interlude!

Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
There's something about you, I stare in your eyes
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall in you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
Ohh (etc.)
We fought in a battle, nobody won
And now we face a mountain to be overcome
You can't turn away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
La la la la la, whoa (etc.)
You'll try everything you never thought would work before
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all
You can always give up some more
Baby nothing means anything unless you're here to share with me
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
'Cause you're always there in my dreams
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
Ohh, la la la (etc.)
You again

Strange
How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are
I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies
That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out
Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

If you find your new love
Isn't what you thought it would be
If you're nights are lonely now
And you need more sympathy
Baby, come runnin' back to me
Come runnin' back to me
Back to the arms that long to hold you
Forever and ever
If you realize that you were
Wrong to say goodbye
Don't allow your foolish pride
To let too long go by
Baby, Come runnin' back to me
Come runnin' back to me
Back to the arms that long to hold you
Forever and ever, my love

Without a word of warning my life has begun
Without a word of warning two hearts beat as one
From out of nowhere you came to me
A breeze passed by whispering your name to me
And without a word of warning, strange as it seems
We kissed and with that kiss you invaded my dreams
I don't know how it happened out of the blue up above
You came along to answer my song of love
I don't know how it ever happened out of the blue up above
You came along to answer my song of love

The stars may deceive you, may vanish and leave you
Be smart, only trust your heart
The breeze softly sighing
In truth, may be lying
Be smart, only trust your heart
The warmth of her kisses
May teach you what bliss is
But this is a faithless lover's heart
Only trust your heart, not the firelight
That comes from the starlight
Be smart, only trust your heart
The warmth of her kisses
May teach you what bliss is
But this is a faithless lover's heart
Only trust your heart, not the firelight
That comes from the starlight
Be smart, only trust your heart

So I walk a little too fast
And I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair
So I talk a little too much
And I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud
When I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare
Do they know, do they care
That it's only
That I'm lonely
And low as can be
And the smile on my face
Isn't really a smile at all
So I smoke a little too much
And I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request
Are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking his place
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair
Do they know, do they care
That it's only
That I'm lonely
And low as can be
And the smile on my face
Isn't really a smile at all
So I smoke a little too much
And I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request
Are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking his place
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair

Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning
No one could be sweeter than my sweetie when I meet her in the morning
Where the morning glories twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie where the dew is pearly early in the morning
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each buttercup at dawning
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say
Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning
Where the morning glories twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie where the dew is pearly early in the morning
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each buttercup at dawning
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say
Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the a.m.
Carolina in the morning

Something has come over me
A feeling I can't explain
The love I lost I found again
My broken heart you came to mend
But it still seems as though we are miles and miles apart
The very best is all I got
It's all I got to give
My soul was lost in darkness
But you arrived to see me through
And you came to me all by surprise
Then I moved the dark ness right out of my eyes
And it's plain to see
That you were all I need
And I want to know
[Chorus:]
Will you be mine?
Sugar will you be mine
Sugar will you be mine
Sugar will you be mine
This kind of love only comes around
Only once in a lifetime
But the last love I tried to hold
It left me feelin' so empty and blue
And it made me afraid to let my true feelings show
I need you here right by my side
Each and every night
My soul is cryin' out to you
It's reaching out for somethin' true
Do I have to go
To get you into my life
The suspense is tearing me, tearing me apart
Won't you bring your love
Bring it all to me
So we can live together eternally
Will you be mine?
[Repeat Chorus]

Senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
There's no end to our love
Our hopes, our dreams, our sighs
No end at all, no sad goodbyes
No fears, no tears, no love that dies
It's senza fine
Senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
Never-ending
The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever more
All we are and all we know
Is love and love alone, so
We'll go floating far above
In never-ending timeless love
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Let it always be senza fine)
Never-ending
The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever more
Let it always be senza fine
Never-ending it's senza fine
La-da-dea-da-da-de

Baby, saddle my pony, saddle up my black mare
Baby, saddle my pony, saddle up my black mare
I'm gonna find a rider, baby, in the world somewhere
"Hello central, the matter with your line?"
"Hello central, matter, Lord, with your line?"
"Come a storm last night an' tore the wire down"
Got a brand new Shetland, man, already trained
Brand new Shetland, baby, already trained
Just get in the saddle, tighten up on your reins
And a brownskin woman like somethin' fit to eat
Brownskin woman like somethin' fit to eat
But a jet black woman, don't put your hands on me
Took my baby, to meet the mornin' train
Took baby, meet that mornin' train
An' the blues come down, baby, like showers of rain
I got somethin' to tell you when I gets a chance
Somethin' to tell you when I get a chance
I don't wanna marry, just wanna be your man

He's got the smile
Swimming grace
Across his face
And it's been a while
Since I saw him last
He left so fast
And I'd like to try
To share a kiss
Or two with you
And I'd love to touch you
So many things
That we can do
So if you do feel the way
That I feel about you
Come on
And share this crush with me
Oh, baby, this love endeavor
Don't have to last forever
Come on
And share
Whatever you want with me
He came when I wanted one
To call all mine
And to my eye
He's one of such
A lovely kind
I could spend my time
Trying to sort
Out your feelings
But it's not my style anymore
So tell me darling
Do you feel the way
That I feel about you
Come on and share
Tyhis crush with me
Oh, baby, this love endeavor
Don't have to last forever
Come on and share
Whatever you want with me
Don't want to mislead you
Let me tell you
Don't wanna take you over
Just come over
Tell me or just show me
That you want me
Love me
If it's only for a week
There's no time
To waste for you and I
No time for fruitless lies
The sun goes by
So does the chance to try
Say yes or say good-bye
So if you do feel the way
That I feel about you
Come on and share
This crush with me
Oh, baby this love endeavor
Don't have to last forever
Come on and share
Whatever you want with me
Would love to touch you
Kiss you, and caress you
Come on and share
This rush with me
Oh, baby, this love endeavor
Don't have to last forever
Come on and share
Whatever you want with me
La, la, la

Did you ever stop to notice
It's when you feel a little low
That the entire spinning universe
Descends to say hello
With heavy-handed cheerfulness
And a calculated smile and says
'Carry me awhile'
But you don't have to carry
Much of anything at all
The biggest thoughts of bigger things
Are really pretty small
The major thoughts that occupy the minor state of mind
Are what we leave behind
Just a minor thought that we can leave behind
Don't worry 'bout the future, you can't afford the price
There's madness to the method when you pay the piper
Twice once when you start to worry
Once again when you begin to take the future on the
Chin I know that you think worry is your ever-faithful
Friend cuz nothin' that you worry over ever happens in the
End and there might be somethin' to it
But it sure gets in the way of fun today
What you say we try and have some fun today
It takes a sense of balance on this tiny little ball
With a tiny mind still big enought to think about it all
To realize the size of things is just a state of mind
And you can change your mind
There's a riddle in the middle of that univeral spin
But we're out here on the edges where it gets a little thin
So just for once permit yourself a carefree little grin
From the outside lookin' in
Cuz we're out here on the outside lookin' in
And it's better on the outside lookin' in

Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say
You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box
Take the box
I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you
Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box

INTRO:
You're completely unaware, dear, that my heart is in your hand
So for love's sake won't you listen and try to understand?
I dream of you more than you dream I do
How can I prove to you this love is real?
You mean to me more than you mean to be
You just can't seem to see the way I feel
When I am close to you the world is far away
The words that fill my heart my lips can't seem to say
I want you so more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do, I dream of you

When I say give me love well don't be meager
Gee can't you see that I'm over eager
Oh baby oh baby obey me
And when my lonely arms need a build up
Well get in my arms and keep them filled up
Oh baby oh baby obey me
Facts are facts and I'm mad about your caress
So relax there's only one word for yes
My love just lives for you why be lonely
I want you for my one and only
Oh baby oh baby obey me do
Songs are writ to tell you what the lovers say
And they're a hit when people believe that way
So darling don't be shy don't be gentle
'cause I want you close and continental
Oh baby oh baby obey me
No maybe hey baby you slay me
Oh baby obey me do

A Little Warm Death
A Little Warm Death won't hurt you none
Come on Relax with me
Let me take away your physicalities
One little warm death coming up
One little warm death with me tonight
A little sweet death
One little cherry breathless mist
Feels like eternity,
There's nobody here, Just you and me
One little warm death coming 'round
One little sweet death with me tonight
In and out of stages
Like the fazes of the moon
It can shine so brightly
Let the fullness soon come soon come soon
But now I feel you near me
See you much more clearly
I can hardly wait to
Feel you moving through my world oh my world
Isn't deep without you
One little warm death?. Come have one [Repeat: x 3]
Little warm death with me tonight
In and out of stages
Like the fazes of the moon
We can shine so brightly
Let the fullness soon come soon come soon
But now I feel you near me
See you much more clearly and
I can hardly wait to
Feel you moving through my world oh my world
Isn't deep without you
One little warm death?. Come have one [Repeat: x 3]
Little warm death with me tonight
?My arms tonight
Don't be afraid [Repeat: x 3]
One One little warm death

Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.
It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.
It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.
Not a bad idea.
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.
You will find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do
The Continental all the time.

Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness
Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness
Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness
Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness

I got the dark night blues
I'm feeling awful bad
I got the dark night blues
Mama, I'm feeling awful bad
That's the worst ol' feeling
That a good man have ever had
I followed my brown
From the depot to the train
I followed my fair brown
From the depot to the train
And the blues came down
Like dark night showers o' rain
I drink so much whiskey
I stagger when I'm sleep
Drink so much whiskey
I stagger when I'm sleep
My brains are dark and cloudy
My mind's gone to my feet
I got the blues so bad
I can feel them in the dark
I got the blues so bad
I can feel them in the dark
And one dark and dreary morning
Baby, when you broke my heart
I got a fair brown in Atlanta
Got one in Macon too
I got a fair brown in Atlanta
Got one in Macon too
I got one in Statesboro
Give me them old dark night blues
Everything I told you
Went and told your outside man
Everything I told you
Mama, you went and told your outside man
But I want to tell you something
Your good man can't stand
Riding the PNP Special
Mama, and I'm leaving this town
Riding the PNP Special
Baby, and I'm leaving this town
Say you didn't want me
I'ma quit hanging around

Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs
It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye
You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye
Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine
Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through
Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you
Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye

Once again
There's a feeling inside of me
Nothing new
I've felt it before
Like the voice of hunger
Inside of me crying out
There's got to be more
I'll put my faith
In the arms of an open road
And you can come along
If you choose
'Cause there's places
That I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do
But give in to the drifter
There's a drifter in me
Though I've tried it
I'm just not a settler
And nine to five
Don't make it with me
Why deny it
It makes me feel better
To come alive
And prove that I'm free
I wear no chains
And I carry no heavy load
So much to gain
And nothing to lose
'Cause there's places
That I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do
But give in to the drifter
There's a drifter in me

They pick me out and put me in the county jail
They pick me out and put me in the county jail
They wouldn't even let my woman come and go my bail
Now I'm in prison, but I've almost did my time
Now I'm in prison, but I've almost did my time
They give me six months, but I had to work out nine
'Cause I know my baby - she's gonna jump and shout
I know my baby - she's gonna jump and shout
When that train roll up and I come walking out
Now play 'em, Mister Tampa
So take these stripes from around me, chains from around my neck
These stripes from around me, and these chains from around my neck
Well, these stripes don't hurt me, but these chains oughta give me death

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all
The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
And we all know
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
The cats all holler "Hooray"
You'll hear them say, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
When he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler, "Beat me up Daddy, beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
The people gather around when he gets up on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there ever bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
A-plink plink, a-plank plank, a-plink plank, plink plank

You better go now
Because I like you much, too much
You have a way with you
You ought to know now
Just why I like you very much
The night was gay with you
There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be Spring
I want you so now
You have the lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because I like you much, too much
There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be Spring
I want you so now
You have the lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because I like you much, too much
You better go, because I like you much, too much

For her first number
Miss Roxie Hart sings a song of love and devotion
Dedicated to her dear husband, Amos
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
But he doesn't care, he'll string along
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine
Sometimes I'm down, sometimes I'm up
But he follows 'round like some droopy-eyed pup
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine
He ain't no sheik, that's no great physique
Lord knows, he ain't got the smarts
But look at that soul, I tell you that whole
Is a whole lot greater than the sum of his parts
And if you knew him like me
I know you'd agree
What if the world slandered my name?
Why, he'd be right there taking the blame
He loves me so and it all suits me fine
That funny, sunny, honey, hubby of mine!
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts
Now he's shot of his trap I can't stand that sap
Look at him go, rattin' on me
With just one more brain what a half-wit he'd be
If they string me up I'll know who brought the twine
That scummy, crummy, dummy, hubby of mine

(Three wishes, just three simple wishes...ooo)
If I only had three wishes
Here, is just what I would do
First, I'd wish for days of gladness
With a someone sweet and true
For my second wish, a dream house
Cozy fireside for two
And the last of my three wishes
Please love me as I love you
(If I only had three wishes)
(Here is just what I would do)
(First I'd wish for days of gladness)
(With a someone sweet and true)
For my second wish a dream house
Cozy fireside for two
And the last of my three wishes
Please love me as I love you [Repeat: 2X]

Just tell me, baby
Just tell me, baby
What can I do
To change your mind?
Hey, hey
Baby can I change your mind?
I got the freight train blues
The tracks is outta line
You got a man in the east
An a man in the west
Jus' sittin' here worryin'
Who you love the best?
Hey, hey
What can I do to change your mind?
I got the blues for you, baby
You keep me worried all the time
You say you love me
I believe in you
You kind of quit me
What mo' can I do?
Hey, hey
Baby, can I change yo' mind?
I got the blue for you, baby
You keep me worried all the time
'Now boy, you know I've got
The blues now'
Play 'em for me, now
'Yas, yas, yas, yas'
My mama got 'em
My papa got 'em
My sister told me
That she had them, too
Hey, hey
Mama, what can I do?
Some old day you will want me
An I won't care a thing about you.

Finally found a fella
Almost completely divine
But his vocabulary
Is killin' this romance of mine
We get into an intimate situation
And then begins this Romeo's conversation
He says, "Murder," he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, "Murder," he says
At a time like this
He says, "Murder," he says
Is that the language of love?
He says, "Solid," he says
Takes me in his arms
And says, "Solid," he says
Meanin' all my charms
He says, "Solid," he says
Is that the language of love?
He says, "Chick, chick, you torture me
Zoot! Are we livin'?"
I'm thinkin' o' leavin' him flat
He says, "Dig, dig, the jumps the old
Ticker is givin'"
Now, he can talk plainer than that
He says, "Murder,"' he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, "Murder," he says
Keep it up like this
And that's, "Murder," he says
In that impossible tone
It will bring on nobody's murder but his own
He says, "Jackson," he says
And my name's Marie
He says, "Jackson," he says
'Shoot the snoot to me'
He says, "Jackson," he says
Is that the language of love?
He says, "Woof, woof," he says
When he likes my hat
He says, "Tsk, tsk," he says
What the heck is that?
He says, "Wooh, wooh," he says
Is that the language of love?
He says, "Hep, hep, with helium
Now babe, we're cookin'"
And other expressions to wit
He says, "We're in da groove
And da groove is good lookin'"
He sounds like his uppers don't fit
He says, "Murder"
He says, "Murder"
And the way he says, "Murder"
In that impossible tone
I've told him over and over and over again
That it'll be nobody else's murder but his own

I tried to get away from your burning lips
I didn't want to play with your burning lips
I tried to get away from the flame but the flame tossed my heart
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
I'm enraptured by your charms
I can't hold out I've been sold out
By the thrills I found locked in your arms
The moment that our eyes met I realized
Another moment more and I'd be hypnotized
I tried to turn away from your eyes but your eyes held me fast
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
There is nothing I can do
I can't back track there's no track back
I am yours heaven open it's doors
And as I wandered through
(Captured by you)
Captured by you
(I couldn't get away get away from you)

Just because you don't speak the language
Doesn't mean that you can't understand
Just because you don't speak the language
Doesn't mean that you can't understand
The twist in the script of the insult
Scrawled on the back of your hand
Torn from the pages of scripture
Sprayed on the wall in the frays of a flag
Kisses forbidden on lips
And all of your fine clothes worn into rags
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There's a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
Don't open the door 'cos they're coming
Don't open the door 'cos they're here
Above there's an ominous humming
Below there's a murmur of prayer
Torn from the pages of scandal
Sprayed on a wall in the frays of the flag
Kisses forbidden on lips
And all of your fine clothes blown into rags
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There's a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There's a cross in the line there's a circus
There's a voice that you might overhear
There's a lens making the picture perfect
They say you have nothing to fear
Torn from the pages of pamphlets
Thrown in the air like confetti in church
Far, far away there's a target
And the sound of an army just starting to march
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There's a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
Just because I don't read the language
Doesn't mean that I'm blind to the threat
Though I thought there was more to forgiveness
Than all we conveniently forget
Torn from the pages of history
Repeated again and again and again
You're either for or against us
And that is how the hatred begins
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There's a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire...

The gentleman is a dope,
A man of many faults,
A clumsy Joe
Who wouldn't know
A rumba from a waltz.
The gentleman is a dope
And not my cup of tea;
Why do I get in a dither?
He doesn't belong to me!
The gentleman isn't bright,
He doesn't know the score;
A cake will come,
He'll take a crumb
And never ask for more!
The gentleman's eyes are blue,
But little do they see,
Why am I beatin' my brains out?
He doesn't belong to me!
He's somebody else's problem,
She's welcome to the guy!
She'll never understand him
Half as well as I.
The gentleman is a dope,
He isn't very smart;
He's just a lug
You'd like to hug
And hold against your heart.
The gentleman doesn't know
How happy he could be,
But look at me cryin' my eyes out
As if he belonged to me;
He'll never belong to me!
The gentleman doesn't know
How happy he could be,
But look at me cryin' my eyes out
As if he belonged to me;
He'll never ever,
He'll never belong to me!

I hear music
Mighty fine music
The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair
Sure that's music
Mighty fine music
The singing of a sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right near by
There's my favourite melody
You, my angel, phoning me
I hear music
Mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song
I hear music
Mighty fine music
The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair
Sure that's music
Mighty fine music
The singing of a sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right near by
There's my favourite melody
You, my angel, phoning me
I hear music
Mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong

Your precious love
Means more to me than
Any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and so blue
For that`s, that`s
What love will do
And, darling, I`m so surprised
Oh, when I first realized
That you, you were fooling me
And, darling, they say
That our love won`t grow
But I just want to tell them
That they don`t know
For as long as
You`re in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea
Of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
You`ll be my girl
And, ooh (wanting you)
While I was wanting you, girl
(I`m so lonely and blue)
For that`s, that`s
What love can do
And every night
(Wanting you)
(I`m so lonely and blue)
That I got to bed
I dream wonderful
Wonderful dreams of you
And, ooh (wanting you)
While I was wanting you...

I walk the streets of New Orleans
With the girl of my dreams
I've seen a dozen brassbands playing swing
While little children laugh, dance and sing
I've seen old men drunk singing the blues
With top hats and canes and spectator shoes
I consider myself lucky to have fallen in love
With the girl, the city, and the river of mud
[Chorus]
Let me know, let me know
where I can go to save my soul
Let me know, let me know
where I can go to save my soul
where I can go to save my soul, yeah...
I had a drink with ol' Louie's ghost
He was the most gracious host
I've heard Gabriel singing and playing his horn
And lived to see the day both my babies were born
I love jelly, fats, Fes and King
They were the ones that taught the world to swing
I consider myself lucky to have fallen in love
With the music, the city, and the river of mud
[Chorus]
Let me know, let me know
where I can go to save my soul
Let me know, let me know
where I can go to save my soul
where I can go to save my soul, yeah...
New Orleans...
New Orleans...
Where I can go to save my soul
Where I can go to save my soul.
I walk the streets of new Orleans

where I can go to save my soul
where i can go to save my soul!
New Orleans, New Orleans, is where I can go to save my soul...
New Orleans, New Orleans, is where I can go to save my soul...
where I can go to save my soul...

Good night sweetheart, till we meet tomorrow
Good night sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow
Tears and parting may make us forlorn
But with the dawn, a new day is born (so I'll say)
Good night sweetheart, tho' I'm not beside you
Good night sweetheart, still my love will guide you
Dreams enfold you, in each one I'll hold you
Good night sweetheart, good night

Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
Hey there, Mister Black Man can you hear me?
I won't dig your diamonds or hunt your game
I just want to be, someone known to you as me
and I will bet my life you want the same
So come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
Seven hundred million are you listening?
Most of what you read is made of lies
But speaking one to one, ain't it everybody's sun
To wake to in the morning when we rise?
So come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung, never sung, before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
Brother Yareshenko are you busy?
If not would you drop a friend a line?
Tell me if the man, who is plowing up your land
has got the war machine upon his mind
Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
Taht we, the people here, don't want a war
Now no doubt some folks enjoy doin' battle
Like presidents and ministers and kings
But let us build them shelves where they can fight among themselves
and leave the people be who like to sing
Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
That we the people here, don't want a war
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
That we the people here, don't want a war

Sound system won't you bring me back up
It's the one thing that I can depend on...
Try to describe to the limit of my ability
It's there a second and then it's given up what it used to be
Contained in music somehow more than just sound
The inspiration coming and it's twisting things around
Because--You always know that it's gonna have to go
You always know that you'll be back in the cold
Point of departure sublimated in a song
It's always coming to give me that hope for just a second then it's gone but--
Sound system won't you bring me back up
It's the one thing that I can depend on....
Static pulse inside of music bringing us escape
It's always temporary, changing nothing in its wake
Just a second where we're leaving all this shit behind
Just a second but it's leaving just this much in mind:
To resist despair, that second makes you see
To resist despair, you can't change everything
To resist despair in this world is--what it is, what it is, what it is to be free
Sound system won't you bring me back up
It's the one thing that I can depend on...
Sound! System!
Sound! System!
Wake up turn my box on bust the shade and let the sun in
Times getting tougher 'bout time to start runnin'
Box in my hand, music by my side
Swingin' to the rhythm of the music by side
Sound system won't you bring me back up
It's the one thing that I can depend on...
Sound! System!
Sound! System!

Autumn in New York,
Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York,
It spells the thrill of first-nighting.
Glittering crowds
And shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel,
They're making me feel
I'm home.
It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love,
Autumn in New York
Is of'en mingled with pain.
Dreamers with empty hands,
They sigh for exotic lands,
It's Autumn in New York,
It's good to live again.
This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair.
Autumn in New York,
You need no castles in Spain.
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park,
It's autumn in New York,
It's good to live again.

Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight
Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away
Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father did not like you at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest
Well, here we are just above the Seine
Foggy little fella,drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight
Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father did not like you at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest
Well, here we are just above the Seine
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight
Bon soir, bon nuit

How sweet it is hearing a nightingale
Echo would call to his mate when the night shadows fall
How sweet that rose ask the bee for it knows
Where the honey drips from honey lips where red roses grow
How sweet it is all of those lovely things
But darling they can't compare with dreams I share with you
I know the glow of love in our hearts like the stars forever will shine
How sweet it is to know that you're mine
How sweet it is hearing a nightingale
Echo will call to his mate when the night shadows fall
How sweet that rose ask the bee for it knows
Where the honey drips from honey lips where red roses grow
How sweet it is all of those lovely things
But darling they can't compare with dreams I share with you
I know the glow of love in our hearts like the stars forever will shine
How sweet it is (How very sweet it it)
How sweet it is to know that you're mine

There's a chill in the evening air
Carries me back to some place where
I thought I'd lost my way forever
Every dream and every plan
Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over
Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending
Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right
But I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
One for life and one for love
And all you've given me
For the dreams you made me dream again
And all that we can be
Holding you tonight, holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one

When your in arms, darling
When your in my arms
Oohhh
That feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
You shake me, break me
Every time your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
When you lock me in, your embrace
And breathlessly, you kiss my face
I get a strange sensation
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
You take control
Of my very soul
Every time your close to me
You make me quiver and shake
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
I touch your lips, your fingertips
I get a loving reaction, soul satisfaction
Darling, you know that
I can't stand it, stand it
Feeling, feeling
And it's got me rockin' and reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
You're earthquakin', soul shakin'
Ever lovin', breath takin'
You're electrifying, ohhh
Soul satisfying
When you walk, in a room
Right away I start to swoon
I'm not sure of what you got
But what it is, I like alot
Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
And it's got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
Shake me, break me
Every time your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'

You must lay some flowers on my grave
You must lay some flowers on my grave
My mother and father have gone
Left me in this world alone
You must lay some flowers on my grave
My father was a roll sport and a gambler too
And he loved makin' and just singin' the blues
I hope my heart will change
I don't want to die the same
You must lay some flowers on my grave
Put a wreath of flowers at my right side
Then you'll know that McTell's satisfied
Put a bouquet in my breast
You know poor boy's gone to rest
You must lay some flowers on my grave
Now when this old building is fallin' down
Just lay me six feet in the cold, cold ground
Wrap me up in the solid clay
'Cause I come here to die one day
Hot mama, lay some flowers on my grave
What a moaning glory at my hidden feet
Then you'll know that McTell's gone to sleep
On my headboard write my name
I leave 'em many girl's heart in pain
Hot mama, lay some flowers on my grave
Don't snatch the pillow from under my head
Don't grieve and worry after the days I'm dead
When I bid you this last goodbye
Don't none of you women's cry
You just lay some flowers on my grave
Now when I'm gone, come no more
And [Incomprehensible]
When you hear that coughing sound
You'll know McTell is in the ground
Hot mama, lay some flowers on my grave
Now when the poor boy's dead and gone
I'm left in this old world all alone
When you hear that church bell toll
You'll know McTell's dead and gone
Hot mama, lay some flowers on my grave

I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
Tell me please,
Where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of.
It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe,
When he says "Hello!"
So I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love!

Charles trenet (jack lawrence)
Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing
Somewhere beyond the sea
He's watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straigt to his arms I'd go sailing
It's far beyond a star, it's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
Some sailing

I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are "A-Maying"
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are "A-Maying"
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Deep night, stars in the sky above
Moonlight, lighting our place of love
Night winds seem to have gone to rest
Two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone
Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone
Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love

Have a little song,
won't take long.
Sing it right,
once or twice.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Pawned my watch.
Pawned my chain.
Pawned everything that was in my name.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Pawned my buggy,
horse and cat.
Pawned everything that was on my lot.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Pawned my chair.
Pawned my bed.
Ain't got nowhere to lay my head.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Pawned my tobacco.
Pawned my pipe.
Pawned everything that was in my sight.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Have a little secret i ain't gonna tell.
I'm goin' to heaven in a brown pea shell.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Pawned my farm.
Pawned my plough.
Pawned everything, even pawned my own cow.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Pawned my hat.
Pawned my shoes.
Pawned everything that i could use.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Have a little secret i ain't gonna tell.
I'm goin' to heaven and i ain't goin' no...
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Chew my tobacco.
Spit my juice.
We raise cain but it ain't nothing a use.
Oh, Lordy me.
Didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.
Everything I got is done and pawned.

That certain night, the night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I may be right, I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I know 'cause I was there
That night in Berkley Square

Have you heard these blues
That I'm gonna sing to you
When you hear them they will thrill you
Through and through
There the sweetest blues you ever heard
Now listen and don't say a word
Sugar blues
Everybody's singing the sugar blues
The whole towns ringing
My loving man sweet as can be
But the doggone fools
Turned sour on me
I'm so unhappy
Feel so unhappy
I could lay me down a die
You could say what you choose
But I'm all confused
I got the sweet, sweet sugar blues
More sugar
I've got the sugar blues
Sugar blues
Every singing the sugar blues
My loving man sweet as can be
But the doggone fools
Turned sour on me
I'm so unhappy
Feel so unhappy
I could lay me down a die
You could say what you choose
But I'm all confused
I got the sweet, sweet sugar blues
More sugar
I've got the sugar blues
Yea!

(Written by Bebel Gilberto, Masaharu Shimizu, Marius De Vries)
After all, all I have in my mind
Is just silence all around
A thousand times I have tried to find
Pieces of dreams. visions and sounds
And then I pray for better days
Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone?
Don't let it go
Never forget that when
I think of you
You're not alone
After all, all I have in my heart
Are the pieces, that I found
Shades of blue, swimming in the moon
Counting the stars all around
I say a prayer for better days
Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone?
Don't let it go
Never forget that when
I think of you
You're not alone
Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone at all?

The girl in the other room
She knows by now
There's something ain't know other fears
Now she wears this thread bare
She sits on the floor
The glass press tight to the wall
She hears murmurs low
The paper is peeling
Her eyes staring straight at the ceiling
Baby be there
Or maybe it's nothing at all
As she draws lipstick smears on the wall
The girl in the other room
She powders her face
And stares hard into her reflection
The girl in the other room
She ?
Adjusting the strap of her gown
She tosses her tresses
Her lover undresses
Turning the last night life down
What's that voice we're hearing
We should be sleeping
Could there be someone who's weeping
Maybe she's there
Maybe there's nothing to see
Just a trace of what used to be
The girl in the other room
She darkens her lash and blushes
She seems to look familiar

Don't let your young life get you down
It always had a certain mystery
Many changes come to everyone
About the time that they turn seventeen
Grandma said at times you'll feel a sting
There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold onto your faith
'Cause in this world you've got to go and get yours
So you stand up
Be strong go out there
Hold on to the real thing that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand it to you on a silver platter
There's no need to feel you're on your own
Just let your intuition guide you through
Take one step toward what you believe
Don't be afraid to make your move
In my head those words remind me what
Grandma said - at times you'll feel a sting
There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold on to your faith
Don't be scared go out there
Stand up
Be strong go out there
Hold on
To the real things that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand' em to you
On a silver platter
Just stand up
Be strong go out there
Hold on
To the real things that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand 'em to you
On a silver platter
Don't be scared go out there
Just stand up my brother sister
Hold on
To the real things that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand it to you
On a silver platter
Stand up my brother sister
Hold on to the real things that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand 'em to you
On a silver platter

Ghost of yesterday
Stalking 'round my room
All night long you stay
Walk around profound gloom
When the darkness falls
When I've gone to bed
Weirdly come your calls
Mournfully, scornfully dead
Folly of a love I strangled
Pulsing heart I thought was gone
Gives no peace
Will not cease
Prowling 'round till dawn
Ghost of yesterday
Every night you're here
Whispering away
"Might have been, might have been, oh, my dear"
Foolish heart must pay
Ghost of yesterday
Yesterday

Your eyes are simpatico
Tonight they have told me
That you'll be simpatico
To me alone
Your arms are simpatico
And when they enfold me
They hold me within a spell
No lover has ever known
When you do the things you do to me
Every thrill I knew is new to me
Go on and do the things you do to me
When do you what you do
You're so sympathetic
Which means you're simpatico
Which means I'm in heaven
And heaven will be our home
When you are mine
When you do the things you do to me
Every thrill I knew is new to me
Go on and do the things you do to me
When do you what you do
You're so sympathetic
Which means you're simpatico
Which means I'm in heaven
And heaven will be our home
When you are mine

Oh don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend
Jesus is my friend
He made this world for us to live in, and gave us everything
And all he asks of us is we give each other love.
Oh ya
Don't go and talk about my father
Cause God is my friend

He loves us whether or not we know it
Just loves us, oh ya
And He'll forgive all our sins
Forgive all our sins
And all He asks of us, is we give each other love.
Oh ya
Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, he works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, your brother
Don't go and talk about my father, He's good to us,
God is my friend
Jesus is my friend
For when we call in Him for mercy, Mercy Father
He'll be merciful, my friend
Oh, yes He will
All he asks of us, I know, is we give each other love,
Oh ya

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes
Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes
Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
Can you imagine how much I love you?

Midnight, I stare at the ceiling.
For a long time
I can't get comfortable, girl.
Moonlight, like a spotlight,
Shining down on this
tangled mess I'm in, girl.
Oh, oh, oh,
I'm begging you please come back.
Oh, oh, oh,
I've got a cold sweat attack.
Miss you, miss you fever.
My temperature's rising girl.
Oh, oh, oh.
Miss you, miss you fever.
Feel like I'm dying girl,
Oh, oh, miss you fever.
Get up, and pace my room again.
I light a smoke.
I look in the mirror.
I reach out and touch my face,
But it's not easy girl,
To wipe away these tears.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I need you by my side.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
I got a raging fire to fight.
Fever, miss you fever.
My temperature's rising girl,
Oh, oh, oh.
Miss you, miss you fever,
Feel like I'm dying girl.
Oh, oh, oh, miss you fever.
And the heat,
It seeps into my mind.
Makes me want to scream,
And shout out your name.
Miss you, miss you fever.
My temperature's rising girl,
Oh, oh, oh.
I miss you, miss you fever.
Feel like I'm dying girl.
Oh, oh, oh.
Miss you fever,
Miss you fever.
Miss you, Miss you fever.
Oh, oh, oh
I miss you, baby.
Oh, oh, oh.
Miss you, miss you fever
Oh, oh, oh,
Miss you, miss you fever.
Oh, I miss you,
Miss you fever.

If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm
And shook his leg
You'd notice him
If someone in a movie show
Yelled "fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg!"
You'd notice him
And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then
Unless, of course, that personage should
Be
Invisible, inconsequential me
Cellophane
Mister cellophane
Should have been my name
Mister cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister cellophane
Should have been my name
Mister cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your
Ears?
You'd notice him
Suppoose you was a woman wed
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years
You'd notice him
A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see
Him there
Unless that human bein' next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished
You know who
Should have been my name
Mister cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister cellophane
Should I bend my name
Mister cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there

You may search the ocean, you might go 'cross the deep blue sea
But mama, you'll never find another hot shot like me
I followed my baby from the station to the train
And the blues came down like night and showered me
I left her at the station wringing her hands and crying
I told her, she had a home just as long as I had mine
I've got two women and you can't tell them apart
I've got one in my bosom and one I got in my heart
The one in my bosom, she's in Tennessee
And the one in my heart, don't even give a darn for me
I used to say a married woman was the sweetest thing that ever been born
But I've changed that thing, you better leave married women alone
Take my advice, let these married women be
'Cause their husbands'll grab you, beat you ragged as a cedar tree
When a woman say, she love you 'bout good as she do herself
I don't pay her no attention, tell that same line to somebody else
I really don't believe no woman in the whole round world do right
Act like an angel in the daytime, mess by the ditch at night
I'm going, pretty mama, please don't break this rule
That's why I'm searching these deserts for the blues
I'm going, pretty mama, searching these deserts now
That's why I'm walking my baby home anyhow
Lord, oh Lord
Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Oh Lordy Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
When a woman say, she love you 'bout good as she do herself
I don't pay her no attention, tell that same line to somebody else
Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole world upside down.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.
Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Run around,
What's the frequency you're on?
Get around,
That's addiction you'll get some.
Heart attack,
Not as big as the next one.
Pulling back,
Things look different when you're young.
Can't find a, good reason.
Can't fight this way I'm feeling.
These jealous, teenagers,
That laugh at my behavior.
You'd be better off without me,
Hate to see you sorry,
Days are closing in,
You're better off with him.
Its boring but I'm making,
Promises i'm breaking,
Days are growing thin,
You're better off with,
Anyone,
Makes no difference just pick one.
Get around,
What's the frequency you're on.
You're scared around,
Conversations you're never wrong.
You're better off,
New relations,
You're better off,
You're better off,
You'd be better off without me,
Hate to see you sorry,
Days are closing in,
You're better off with him.
Its boring but I'm making,
Promises i'm breaking,
Days are growing thin,
You're better off with,
I can't take it anymore,
I can't concentrate.
You run around,
In my brain, yeah you run around
You're not having fun no more,
There's a thousand ways.
You get around,
In my brain, yeah you get around.
Run around, what's the frequency you're on?
Get around, what's the frequency you're on?

Yesterday we were gay
I was high on a rainbow
But now there's no rainbow
You've gone and so a lover is blue
Life was sweet, so complete
Now I've suddenly wakened
To find I'm forsaken
Alone and so a lover is blue
Do you still remember our love affair?
Does it matter to you?
But I'll have to go through our door to care
Here and there everywhere
Every scene just reminds me
Of something that binds me
To you and so a lover is blue

Somebody else is taking my place,
Somebody else now shares your embrace;
While I am trying to keep from crying,
You go around with a smile on your face.
Little you know the price I have paid,
Little you care for vows that you made;
My heart is aching, soon will be breaking,
For somebody's taking my place.

Heart and soul
I fell in love with your heart and soul
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night
Heart and soul
I begged to be adored
I lost control and tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so faintly willing
But now I see what one embrace can do
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul
Now I see what one embrace can do
Look at me; it's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul

When your sweetie tells you
Everything'll be okay
Just skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope
Skeetle-at-de-op-de-day
If you feel like shoutin'
Advertise it just this way
And skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope
Skeetle-at-de-op-de-day
Don't give a hang
What words you use at any time
Sing this silly language
Without any reason or rhyme
When you face the preacher
There's only one thing to say
Just skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope
Skeetle-at-de-op-day

Turn me on, turn me over, turn me all around
I can do a show now, I can make it easy.
You don't have to be so hard, we don't have to go there.
If it is what it's gonna be, we don't have to rush.
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy, easy, easy.
(Verse)
All the places we can go, this is the beginning
Simply so good, don't you know, even in the in day
If you like it, just enjoy, you don't need a reason.
I can see it happen now, baby, can't you feel it?
Easy, easy, easy,
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy, easy, easy.
Make it easy, baby.
Don't you want to
Make it easy, baby.
Don't you want to
Make it easy, make it easy.
Easy, easy, easy,
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy, easy, easy.

Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know
Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread
I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya
Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

The last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gray
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafe
The last time I saw Paris
Her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees
And birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs
That I had dodged for years
The chorus of the squeaky horns
Was music to my ears
Oh the last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they changed her
I'll remember her ah that way
Dodged the same old taxicabs
That I had dodged for years
The chorus of the squeaky horns
Was music to my ears
Yeh, the last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they change her
I'll remember her that way
The last time I saw Paris
The last time I saw Paris

My ghosts and monsters
They wake me every night
Sharp teeth and bad breath
Whispering your name
I'm not quite lonely
Feels more like scared to death
your memory haunts me
When I put myself to bed
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Talking in my sleep
And waking to an empty home
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Since you've been gone
Bela Lugosi
And Boris Karloff too
Make such strange bedfellows
But how to they know you

I cant even believe we're having this conversation again...oh my god.
Here's the thing
I need you to stop treating me as if I'm simple or naive.
As if I don't know nothing bout the world.
I understand you think you protecting me,
But I could use a little room to breathe
And the respect you give a woman not a girl,
Here's the thing
I appreciate all the love
The constant catering kisses and hugs
But lately I'm wondering what you do it for
If the reason you act all over sweet is
Cause you want to keep me on a leash.
I have no choice but to show you the door.
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
If you want to cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down
I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman I am not your porcelain doll
Here's the thing you wanna put me in fancy clothes
And take me everywhere you go
And show me off to all your fancy friends
Well here's the thing
I really don't mind the clothes
I love a nice dress with some open toes
But a trophy I'm not, So baby think again
(Hey) and Here's the thing
You always wanna hold my hand
And say things to me like I'm the man
So let me do what a man's suppose to do
Well here's the thing you can be the man all the while
Understanding I am not a child
You're the man for sure, but baby I'm grown too
Hey Hey
[Chorus: x2]
If you want to cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down
I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman
I am not your porcelain doll
If you want to cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down
I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman I am not your porcelain doll
(Hook) said you gotta respect me totally
Otherwise I'm going up and leave
And baby I know you don't want me to do that.
So you gotta respect me totally, so when I say back up off of me
Just kiss my cheek and politely move back
[Chorus: x2]
If you want to cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down
I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman I am not your porcelain doll
I'm a full grown woman I am not your porcelain doll
One more time
I'm a full grown woman I am not your porcelain doll

Lord, the revenue men is ridin', boy, you'd better look out
(Aw, sure, if it ain't Purvis)
Lord, the revenue men is ridin', boy, you'd better look out
(Boy, if he hollers at you, you don't stop, boy)
If he hollers at you, don't stop, you will likely be knocked out
Well, I don't allow her salt water, well, she always wants a drink
(Got to have a drink)
I don't allow her salt water, she always wants a drink
(Wanna drink? See you with a bottle, though)
If they see you with a bottle, they will almost break your neck
Oh, take me home through, Lord, that shy nest door
(Aw, sure)
I said take me home through that shy nest door
(She don't need no telephone to get there, aw, sure)
She don't need no telephone, daddy will take you in his car
Oh, come on mama, let us go to the edge of town
(Aw, sure)
Come on, mama, let us go to the edge of town
(Baby, I know where Charley's got his other nest built at)
I know where there's another bird nest built down on the ground

She's the lady with the fan,
When she comes by, hold your man,
She made Smoky Joe so ginny
He forgot about his Minnie.
She's the lady with the fan!
She's the lady with the fan,
Can she dance? Yeah, man!
Every wiggle gets a giggle
From the hick who pays a nickel.
To see the lady with the fan!
She's the lady with the fan,
She's the lady with the fan,
She's such a grand attraction,
She put lazy-bones in action,
She's the lady with the fan!
She's the lady with the fan,
She's the lady with the fan,
In fair or stormy weather,
She shakes them both together,
She's the lady with the fan!

If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side, and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow
Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa
If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B, I would have died too
I'd have liked to
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting

You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.
You're lunching at twenty-one and watchin' your diet,
Declining a Charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.
There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
Who knows what's written in the magic book.
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
Invite her in without a second look.
You're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand.
This could be the start of something very big,
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me, and see.
This could be the start of something wonderful,
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me, and see.
Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something,
This could be the heart of something,
This could be the start of something big.

Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

By the river
Rio Bravo, I walk all alone
And I wonder as I wander by the river
Where my love has flown
All the birds in the cottonwood above her
Know I love her, know I care
But my dreams, like the songs, she sang in Spanish
Seem to vanish in the air
I wonder where
So I wonder as I wander
Will love come along
Must I live ever after
By the memory of her song

Come take my hand
Come walk again with me
In my dream of love
The stars above
But dreams will fade
And all the plans we made
Will go up in flame
All in vain
Now every story has an end
And we can't go on pretending like we used to
(Used to)
And I should go off by myself
To preserve my mental health but I don't choose to
(I might lose you)
'Cause I'm waiting for the big one
I'm waiting for the ground to start to shake
I'm waiting for the big one
When the walls start to crumble and love comes a tumblin'
Down, down, down
I never knew
I never saw the writing
On the crumbling wall
We had it all
Well, I've done the best I can
Built you castles in the sand just to keep you
(Keep you)
But the tide's coming in
And I'll sink if I don't swim but I can't leave you
(I won't leave you)
'Cause I'm waiting for the big one
I'm waiting for the walls to start to shake
I'm waiting for the big one
When my heart starts to break and the earth starts to quake
Waiting for the big one
They built this house of love on shaky ground
I'm waiting for the big one
When the walls start to crumble and love comes a tumblin'
Down, down, down, down
And all this time
I thought the world would turn
And the sun would shine
You'd be mine, all mine
But I can't find a trace
Of the love in your face that I'm used to
(Used to)
You don't need me anymore
And I can walk right out that door if I choose to
(But I don't choose to)
'Cause I'm waiting for the big one
I'm waiting for the walls to start to shake
I'm waiting for the big one
When my heart starts to break and the earth starts to quake
Waiting for the big one
They built this house of love on shaky ground
I'm waiting for the big one
When the walls start to crumble and love comes a tumblin'
Down, down, down, down
I'm waiting for the big one
I'm waiting for the big one
I'm waiting for the big one

Confused, confused every time I'm lost in your arms
Confused, confused by the way my heart sounds alarm
Are all your dreams for me alone
Or is there one who shares my throne
Abused, misused, tell me why you must hurt me so
Oh it's wrong sweetheart you know
There may come the day
When I hear you say
That you too have been confused
(Confused, confused every time I'm lost in your arms
Confused, confused by the way my heart sounds alarm)
Abused, misused, tell me why you must hurt me so
Oh it's wrong sweetheart you know
There may come that day
When I hear you say
That you too have been confused

Arianne is april morning, that comes rippling through my window.
She's the smell of coffee brewing, on a quiet, rainy sunday.
She's the purring of a kitten,
that has made my neck a pillow for his head.
Arianne is silly music that my father used to whistle.
She's the new leaf on a fire
that I had given up last winter
And what writers have to feel like when they suddenly discover they've been read.
Arianne is momma's crystal bread that's nearly finished baking
She's a rainbow in a puddle
and the happiest birthday
she's a'goin out on friday and a'comin back on monday with a tan.
Arianne is made of feelings so I milk her of her kisses
And I swallow up her breathing and I taste her where she love me
And I'm filled to overflowing but there's always room for more Arianne

Just follow me,
And you will see,
What folks in Harlem
Call Trickeration.
Don't mean a thing,
This crazy swing,
Latest thing in Harlem,
Trickeration!
Rhythm, look what you went and done,
Rhythm, you are the guilty one.
Another phrase,
Just another craze,
Everyone in Harlem
Does Trickeration.

Everyday, there's something new honey, to keep me loving you
And with every passing minute, so much joy wrapped up in it
Oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
And now, I've got a song to sing,
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me reason for living
And oh, you taught me the meaning of giving
Oh, oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad
To see laughter in the eyes where tears used
To be
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much girl I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation, cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration
Oh, oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love

Buona sera signorina buona sera
It is time to say goodnight to Napoli
Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera
With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea
In the morning signorina we'll go walking
Where the mountains help the moon come in to sight
And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger
In the meantime let me tell you that I love you
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight
(Buona sera signorina buona sera)
(It is time to say goodnight to Napoli)
Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera
With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea
In the morning signorina we'll go walking
Where the mountains help the moon come in to sight
And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger
And in the meantime I buy a wedding ring for your finger
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight

Blow, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good
No good
Go, ill wind, go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that's no good
[Chorus 1:]
You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame
So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good
No good
[Chorus 1]
I'll wind

Why did I always depend on you
When I knew that you'd end
In another's arms?
As a rule I'm no fool
But it seems where love's concerned
There's no rule for a fool
Who would let his heart be burned
And you intended to fool me too
That's no lie
And you can't deny it's true
From the start in my heart
I knew what you'd do
Why did I depend on you?

Get in trouble at Belzoni, there ain't no use a-screamin'
And cryin'
Get in trouble in Belzoni, there ain't no use a-screamin'
And cryin'
Mr. Will will take you, back to Belzoni jailhouse flyin'
Le' me tell you folksies, how he treated me
Le' me tell you folksies, how he treated me
An' he put me in a cellar, just as dark as it could be
There I laid one evenin', Mr. Purvis was standin' 'round
There I laid one evenin', Mr. Purvis was standin' 'round
Mr. Purvis told Mr. Will to, let poor Charley down
It takes booze and blues, Lord, to carry me through
Takes booze and blues, Lord, to carry me through
But it did seem like years, in a jailhouse where there is
No boo'
I got up one mornin', feelin' awe, hmm
I got up one mornin', feelin' mighty bad, hmm
An' it might not a-been them Belzoni jail I had
(Blues I had, boys)
While I was in trouble, ain't no use a-screamin'
When I was in prison, it ain't no use a-screamin and
Cryin'
Mr. Purvis the onliest man could, ease that pain of mine

Baby saddle my pony, saddle up my black mare
I'm gonna find a rider, baby, in the world somewhere
Hello central, what's the matter with your line?
Come a storm last night, tore the wire down
Got a brand new Shetland, man, already trained
Just get in the saddle, tighten up on your reins
And a brown-skinned woman like somethin' fit to eat
But a jet black woman, don't put your hands on me
Took my baby, to meet the mornin' train
And the blues come down, baby, like showers o' rain
I got somethin' to tell you when I get a chance
I don't wanna marry, just wanna be your man

Non Dimenticar means don't forget your heart my darling
Don't forget to be all you mean to me
Non Dimenticar my love is like a star my darling
Shining bright and clear
Just because you're here
Please do not forget that our lips have met
And I held you tight dear
Was it dreams ago
My heart felt this glow only just tonight dear
Non Dimenticar although you travel far my darling
It's my heart you'll own so I'll wait alone
Non Dimenticar
Non Dimenticar although you travel far my darling It's my heart you'll own so I'll wait alone Non Dimenticar

She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
when she was my girl
I held her near
Told her how much I cared
When she was my girl
when she was my girl
When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Everyday
When she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone, gone, gone gone, gone!
I spend the night
Dreaming how she used to be
When she was my girl
when she was my girl
When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Yes it was
Cause she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone
She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
My girl
She was my girl

Sometimes it amazes me
How strong the power of love can be
Sometimes you just take my breath away
You watch my love grow like a child
Sometimes gentle and sometimes wild
Sometimes you just take my breath away
And it's too good to slip by
Too good to lose
Too good to be there just to use
I'm gonna stand up on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away
Sometimes it amazes me
How strong the power of love can be
Sometimes you just take my breath away
Your beauty is there in all I see
And when I feel your eyes on me
Oh don't you know you just take my breath away
And it's too good to slip by
Too good to lose
Too good to be there just to use
I'm gonna stand up on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away
And it's too good to slip by
Too good to lose
Too good to be there just to use
I'm gonna stand up on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away
Oh yes you take my breath away

I'm gonna love you
Like no one's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
Deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you'll let me
You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
And won't it be fine?
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
And won't it be fine?
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Bird alone flying high
Flying through a clouded sky
Sending mournful soulful sounds
Soaring over troubled grounds
Bird alone with no mate
Turning corners tempting fate
Flying circles in the air
Are you on your way somewhere
Gliding soaring on the wind
You're a sight of glory
Flying way up there so high
Wonder what's your story
Bird alone flying low
Over where the grasses grow
Swingin' low then out of sight
You'll be singing in the night

Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh
And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah
And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me
And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be
Although my pride, yeah, is not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah
His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah
And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah
So with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me, yeah
And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me

When they tell you I'm dating
With somebody new
Don't you know that I'm playing a part
Forgetting you
I still want you to want me
Though you said we're through
Can't you see that I don't want to start
Forgetting you
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine
I don't want other kisses
Only yours will do
Don't you know that it's breaking my heart
Forgetting you
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine
I don't want other kisses
Only yours will do
Don't you know that it's busting my heart
Forgetting you
Forgetting you
Forgetting you

Beautiful dreamer,
Wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops
Are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world
Heard in the day
Led by the moonlight
Have all passed away
Beautiful dreamer,
Queen of my song
List' while I woo thee
With soft melody
Gone are the cares of
Life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer
Awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer,
Awake unto me

You're the same old girl
That lived across the street
And you're the same old girl, yeah
That I was dying to meet
Well, now you're running around
And you think that I don't know
And you know if I found out
It's gonna hurt me so
And it hurts me so bad
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please

Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream
And I remember
When you kissed me
You said you loved me so much, girl
Said our love would always be
Now you're running around
You think that I don't know
And you know if I find out
It's gonna hurt me so
And it hurts me so bad
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please

Now you know
You know just how the whole story goes
Just against the real and the proudest who laugh
Thought i let you know what i'm giving back
Confusion, Difussion
Just show it, You know it
Come'on you can discover (Discover)
You know you can recover (Recover)
You'd be (arriving)
At new (Horizon)
It will be (Surprising)
To me (Keep rising)
Keep rowing (Keep rowin')
Keep showing (Keep showin')
Keep it true and strong in your heart
And you'll get by
But only if you'll make it real
Real, Make it real
We live the lie, deny the love
Hangin' on, with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the whole damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut (everybody now!)
Tryin' to make it real compared to what?
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
fool dumb bigots gainin' power
Tired old ladies kissin' dogs
Isn't the human race above them all? (I can't use it!)
Try to make it real compared to what?
The President, he's got his war
Still don't know what it is for
They change the game with no rhyme or reason
Drop the mans flag ang they call it treason
We're chicken-feathers roasting like a nut (ooh baby now)
Tryin' to make it real compared to what?
Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
He never wondered if he's really right
Iv'e got a fire buring in my gut (I can't kill it)
Tryin' to make it real compared to what?
confusion, difussion
Just show it, you know it
Discover, recover
Surprise'm, keep rising
Surprise it, realize it
Keep rowin', keep showin'
Keep show'em, keep flowin'
Come'on with me baby bat this
And you'll get by
And you'll get by
But only if you'll make it real
Make it real...
Tryin' to make it real compared to what?

Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said, "You moved away"
And left me all your bills to pay"
Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon
Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure ain't hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you ain't living here no more
It's too bad
I think you made your move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I came back, and they still care you know
One love ahead
One love behind
One in my arms and one on my mind
It's one thing baby
I never make my move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back, you know they still all care
One love ahead and one behind
One in my arms you know, one on my mind
And it's one thing people
I never make my move too soon

Darlin' I want you to listen,
I stayed up all night,
So I can get this thing right.
And I don't think,
There's anything missin'.
'Cause a person like you,
Made it easy to do.
I've waitin' for so long,
To sing to you this song.
Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven,
Your smile could heal a million souls.
Your love completes my existence.
Your the other half that makes me whole.
Your the only other half that makes me whole.
I think the angels are your brothers (ya ya)
They told you about me.
Said your just what she needs.
And I find myself,
Thanking your mother.
For giving birth to a saint,
My spirit flies when I say your name.
If there's one that's true,
It's that I was born to love you.
(and) Your eyes are the windows to heaven,
Your smile could heal a million souls.
Your love completes my existence.
Your the other half that Makes Me Whole.
Your the only other half that Makes Me Whole.
You make my dreams,
Come true over and over again.
And I honestly, truly believe,
You and me are written in the stars.
And in my whole life through,
Just given thanks to you.
Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven.
Your smile could heal a million souls.
Your love completes my existence.
Your the other half that makes me whole.
Your the only other half that makes me whole.

And I thought that life
Would be so cold
I thought I'd need someone to hold
Like in the stories I was told
And then we met
I can't forget
How we laughed
And then
Suddenly the end
I hoped
Hoped for your love
For your love
For your love
How I hoped
For your love
For your love
For your love

A town's a lonely town,
When you pass through
And there is no one waiting there for you,
Then it's a lonely town.
You wander up and down,
The crowds rush by,
A million faces pass before your eye,
Still it's a lonely town.
Unless there's love,
A love that's shining like a harbor light,
You're lost in the night;
Unless there's love,
The world's an empty place
And every town's a lonely town.

Listen all you chillunto that voodoo moan,
There's a modern villunworser than that old boogie woogie,
When that goofy critterspot your fancy clothes,
He injects a jitter,
Starts you dancing on a thousand toes,
There he goes.
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible
buzz,
But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The
Jitterbug does;
So be careful of that rascal,
Keep away from The Jitterbug, The Jitterbug.
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible

But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The

So be careful of that rascal,
Keep away from The Jitterbug, The Jitterbug.
Oh! The Jitter, Oh! The Bug,Oh!
The Jitterbug, Bugabug, bugabug, bugaboo.
In a twitter, in the throes,
Oh the critter's
Got me dancing on a thousand toes,
Thar' she blows
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible

In a town on the sea, by the castle Doonee
The fairest of all, was the maiden Eileen
The bloom on her cheek was as fresh as the dew
And her heart to a young fisher laddie was true
At morn he would sail with the sun and the tide
That he would return to his promised young bride
And down by the shore she could hear it so plain
His voice in the wind singing soft this refrain
Eileen, my Eileen, oh wait for me wait Eileen
They were to be wed on a Sunday in May
In faith it was a joy to see Eileen so gay
The morning before he set sail with the tide
But he never returned to his promised young bride
No, no, never more was her heart light and warm
Her lover he died, yes he died in a storm
And down by the shore, she could hear it so plain
His voice in the wind, singing soft this refrain
Eileen, my Eileen, oh wait for me wait Eileen
They say that her heart it was broken in two
The lovely Eileen oh so young and so true
And down by the shore they who loved her the best
By the rock where she waited, they laid her to rest
Oh many the years that have past since that day
But maidens who wait for their lovers they say
That down on the shore they could still hear so plain
His ghost in the wind, singing soft this refrain
Eileen, my Eileen, oh wait for me wait Eileen

Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to
And make the world go away
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away

A moonless night
On the first snow
Love wore a face
Charming but strange
Eyes without lids
You
Time flew away
From here and there
I did not see
Eternity
Above a sea
Of golden faces
Silence and cold
Of lunar grace
I ate a star
You
Never the same
Leaf'll turn again

Thanks for the memory
Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wond'rous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was
And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was
Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me
But, thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still
I miss you so much
Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was
Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was
Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too
I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry, baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
And thank you so much

How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.
How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?

Why are you so quiet, it's safe that's you got something too high?
And why are you so cold, it's safe you don't want to be hold
Why can't you talking to my eyes
Is it because you're scared you don't want to see yourself inside ?
I really want to know what it is
But I can't know if you don't give me your chance
Baby you think I wouldn't understand
But I'm hear as a friend
I wish I could watch your soul to know you better
I wish I could read like a book
Letter by letter
Why are you so quiet, it's safe that's you got something too hide
And why are you so cold, it's safe you don't want to be hold
Why is it this that I cant get throw to you
Cause I feel frustrated cause I don't know what to do
I really want to know what is it
But I can't know if you don't give me your chance
Baby you think I wouldn't understand
But I'm hear as a friend
I wish I could watch your soul to know you better
I wish I could read like a book
Letter by letter [x2]

Jenny Neale
Down in Beale
Gave her papa the air
Left him cold
Got him told
Said she didn't care
Old Joe, her beau
Looked just like he would die
If you was near him
You would hear him
Sob his mournful cry
Beale Street Papa
Why don't you come back home?
It isn't proper to leave your mama all alone!
Sometimes I was cruel, that was true
But Papa, you know Mama never two-timed you!
Boo-hoo, I'm blue
So how come you do me like you do?
I'm cryin'!
Beale Street Papa, don't mess around with me!
There's plenty pettin' that I can get in Tennessee
I'll still get my sweet cooking, constantly
But not the kind you served to me
So Beale Street Papa, come back home!
So how come you do me like you do?
I'm cryin'!
Beale Street Papa, don't mess around with me!
There's plenty pettin' that I can get in Tennessee
I bought a rifle, razor and a knife
A full support [?] can't save my life
So Beale Street Papa, come back home!

Alright, Lonnie, Junior, the band, the girls and I, we're gonna do a song for you now, a little Mac Rise number.
Hey, all you married men, if you're tied up, you better stay tied up. Because it's cheaper to keep her.
It's cheaper to keep her
It is cheaper to keep her
When your little girl makes you mad
You get an attitude and pack your bag
Five little children that you're leaving behind
You're gonna pay some alimony or do some time
It's cheaper to keep her (Cheaper to keep her)
It's cheaper to keep her (Cheaper to keep her)
See when you get to staring that judge in the face
You're gonna want to cuss the whole human race
It's cheaper to keep her (Cheaper to keep her)
Too much to leave that little girl (Cheaper to keep her)
It's cheaper, it's cheaper, cheaper, it's cheaper
It's cheaper, it's cheaper
It's cheaper cheaper cheaper cheaper, yeah
You didn't pay for two dollars to bring the girl home
Now you're about to pay two thousand to leave alone
See another woman out there, you want to make a change
She ain't gonna watch you 'cause you won't have a damn thing
It's cheaper to keep her (Cheaper to keep her)
Cheaper to keep her (Cheaper to keep her)
The time you get to looking at the judge in the face
You're gonna want to cuss the whole human race
It's cheaper to keep her (Cheaper to keep her)
Cost too much to leave (It's cheaper to keep her)
It's cheaper, cheaper, it's cheaper, it's cheaper
It's cheaper, cheaper
Cheaper cheaper cheaper cheaper, yeah
If you decide to roam
And leave your happy home
You gotta pay the house note
The child support, your insurance

I love those dear hearts and gentle people
Who live in my home town
Because those dear hearts and gentle people
Will never ever let you down
They read the good book
From Fri till Monday
That's how the weekend goes
I've got a dream house
I'll build there one day
With picket fence and rambling rose
I feel so welcome each time that I return
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
I love the dear hearts and gentle people
Who live and love in my home town
There's a place I'd like to go
And it's back in Idaho
Where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello
It's a pleasure and a treat
To meander down the street
That's why I want the whole wide world to know
(I love those dear hearts)
I love the gentle people
(Who live in my home town)
Because those dear hearts and gentle people
Will never ever let you down
They read the good book
From Fri till Monday
That's how the weekend goes
I've got a dream house
I'll build there one day
With picket fence and rambling rose
I feel so welcome each time that I return
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
I love the dear hearts and gentle people
Who live and love in my home town
(Home, home, sweet home)
(Home, home, sweet home)
(Home, home, sweet home)
(Home, home, sweet home)

You don't have to believe every single thought
That tumbles through your head
Just 'cause it sounds like you talking.
Sometimes all you can do
Is say goodnight and tuck your demons into bed,
'Cause they're not worth fighting
Turn out the lights on your racing mind
Turn out the lights on your racing mind
You keep a running list
Of all your doubts and your dead ends,
And when you pull yourself out of bed,
You taste them on the tip of your tongue.
And in the morning when you're standing in the shower
With the water pouring down,
You dwell on all you ever did wrong
Turn out the lights on your racing mind.
Turn out the lights on your racing mind.
What good has ever come of it?
What answers will you find?
Turn out the lights on your mind
Oh, turn out the lights on your mind
Turn out the lights on your mind
Oh, turn out the lights on your mind
You don't have to believe every single thought
That tumbles through your head
Just 'cause it sounds like you talking

Ah, Lord, ah, Lord
Year of nineteen hundred and twelve, April the fourteenth day
Great Titanic struck an iceberg, people had to run and pray
God moves, moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
The guards who had been a-watching, asleep 'cause they were tired
When they heard the great excitement, then a gunshot was fired
God moves, moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
Captain Smith gave orders, women and children first
Many of the lifeboats piled right up, many were liable to crush
God moves on, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
So many had to leave their happy home, all that they possess
Lord Jesus, will you hear us now, help us in our distress
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, people had to run and pray
Women had to leave their loving ones, see 'bout their safety
When they heard the liner was doomed, hearts did almost break
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
A.G. Smith, mighty man, built a boat that he couldn't understand
Named it a name of God in a tin, without a "c", Lord, he pulled it in
God moves, ah, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
Well Ah, ah, Lord

S-sitting down by my window,
Oh, looking at the rain
S-sitting down by my window now now,
All around I felt it,
All I could see was the rain
Something grabbed a hold of me, honey,
Felt to me honey like, lord, a ball and chain

World is still crying, man, when the other half of the world is still

Cat for 365 days, right you ain't got him for 365 days, you got him for one
Day, man, well I tell you that one day

It's all the same fucking day, man

Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly not me
Who told you that it was alright to love me
Certainly not me

Who told you that it was alright to love me

Jazz, oh jazz.
It's nice with jazz.
Playing in aruba.
Playing in bahama.
Come on pretty mama.
Duke's here.
Coleman too.
Let us play this song for you!

Don't want my manny, I don't need a friend
My heart is broken, it won't ever mend
I ain't much carin' just where I will end
I must have that man
I'm like an oven that's cryin' for heat
He treats me awful each time that we meet
It's just unlawful how that boy can cheat
But I must have that man
He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms
When she's kissed
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed

Baby I know, you hear a lot of talk
About the bad times ahead
That I'm the wrong kind of man
What you need is a doctor or a lawyer instead
Well I know that I'm not made of money
And God knows I'm a fool
But you know that
I'll always be there for you
People like us got no business in love
Yeah, that's what the people say
But people like them got nothing better to do
Than chase our dreams away
Well I've finally found you and I won't let go
They say it's never gonna last
But baby, what do they know
When they say people like us got no business being in love
Baby I know, things may not get better
Before they get worse
They've all got their reasons why we can't survive
They'll quote you chapter and verse
Well I know that this life isn't easy
And God knows times are hard
But you know
That I'll always take care of you
Yeah people like us got no business in love
Oh, that's what the people say
But people like them got nothing better to do
Than chase our dreams away
Well I've finally found you and I won't let go
They say it's never gonna last
But baby, what do they know
When they say people like us got no business being in love
I wanna made make them all look foolish, yeah
And in the end, we're gonna make them eat their words, oh yeah
Well I've finally found you and I won't let go
They say it's never gonna last
But baby, what do they know
When they say, people like us got no business, oh
People like us, yeah oh baby
People like us got no business being in love
Oh oh, what do they know
Oh oh, people like us baby
People like us got no business in love

I dream of you nights
daytime too
Like someone slipped me something
And that something's you
Almost walked into a wall
Imagining your embrace
Had to snap myself out of the thought
Of your lips and your heavenly daze
This sensation is real
The blood rushes into
each place as if you were here
Elevating me to
Closed eyed elation
Hearbeat is racing
This evocation
Got me afraid of
The rapture stirring inside of me
Got me afraid of
What I'm gonna do if I get you to see
Got me Afraid of
You
So fine sometimes I forget to breathe
Got me afraid that
Wherever you are is wherever I have to be
Faces are fading
Replaced with yours
bodies are changing
into your beautiful form
Want to feel your pulse
beating inside mine
Want you to press against me
like if you don't you'll die
This sensation is real
The blood rushes into
each place as if you were here
Elevating me to
Closed eyed elation
Hearbeat is racing
This evocation
Got me afraid of
The rapture stirring inside of me
Got me afraid of
What I'm gonna do if I get you to see
Got me Afraid of
You
So fine sometimes I forget to breathe
Got me afraid that
Wherever you are is wherever I have to be
You must be kin to the moon
Cause when you're up and out and full
I could be anywhere and feel the pull
Whispering to my ocean
It's glow and nectar flowing
into my spine
And This Is Why... I am
Afraid of
The rapture stirring inside of me
Got me afraid of
What I'm gonna do if I get you to see
Got me Afraid of
You
So fine sometimes I forget to breathe
Got me afraid that
Wherever you are is wherever I have to be

Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
And then if you no longer care for the love that's being there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartache linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

I'm just about fed up
I've finally had my fill
Of sitting around and crying in my beer
I've drunk the bitter cup
I've downed the bitter pill
While waiting for the silver lining to appear
I'm going to stack my blues up
On the very highest shelf
I'm going to pack my blues up
And get wise to myself
(Weep no more, my baby)
(Weep no more, my baby)
Weep no more
I'm going to weep no more
I'm putting an end to this lonesome game
(It's such a lonesome game this crying)
Cry no tears, I'm going to cry no tears
Each time that I happen to hear his name
(I hear his name)
I'm going out on the town
This hopeless torch I will drown
'Cause I'm tired of running around
(Running around)
With just a memory
Weep no more, I'm going to weep no more
Till somebody weeps
(Until somebody weeps) for me
I'm going to stack my blues up
On the very highest shelf
I'm going to pack my blues up
And get wise to myself
Weep no more, I'm going to weep no more
Till somebody weeps for me

Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four
Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?
Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'
Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.
Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'
Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

My love, my love is a mountainside so firm-
So firm it can calm the tide
My love for you is a mountainside
It stands so firm it can calm the tide
That's why my love, my love is
A mountainside
My love, my love is an ocean's roar
So strong, so strong that I can't let you go
My love for you is an ocean's roar
It's grown so strong that I can't let you go
That's why my love, my love is
An ocean's roar
My love is longer than forever
And endless as the march of time
'Till ninety-nine years after never
In my heart you'll still be mine
Because my love
My love is a deep blue sea
So deep, so deep that I'll never be free
My love for you is a deep blue sea
It's grown so strong that I'll never be free
That's why my love, my love is
A deep blue sea

Verse
POTTER:
Come on, you children, gather around -
Gather around, you children.
And we will lose that evil spirit
Called the voodoo.
Nothin' but trouble, if he has found,
If he has found you, children -
But you can chase the hoodoo
With the dance that you do.
Let me lead the way.
Jubilee today!
He'll never hound you;
Stamp on the ground, you children!
Come on!
Refrain
Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!
Halleluyah! Halleluyah!
Ev'rybody come along and join the Jubilee!
Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!
Don t you lose time! Don't you lose time!
Come along-it's shake yo' shoes time
Now for you and me!
On the sands of time
You are only a pebble;
Remember, trouble must be treated
Just like a rebel;
Send him to the Debble!
Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!
Halleluyah! Halleluyah!
Everybody come along and join the Jubilee!

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.
Weary, totin' such a load,
Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Weary totin', it's such a load,
While I'm travelin' down, travelin' down that lonesome old road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, "Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top"
The buzzard told the monkey, "You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free"
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
"Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie"
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top

On the 8th of November
I remember telling her that we'd be together forever
But things have changed
Now re rearranged we are now no longer together
It was the way she spoke,my heart broke
I thought that I would never love again
But then you came along, so I changed my song
With you my life would never be the same
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
It was the day you were born,my attention was torn
I no longer only thought of myself
You see, there's half of you and half of me
And that love really set's me free
So now the moral to this tale is if your love should fail
Pick your heart up off the ground
You see, love comes down when you're nowhere around
It's just the way things have got to be
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better, yeah
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
A better a better a better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better, yeah
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better, yeah
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better
An' things have changed, and they're only getting better, yeah

Oh, ho
How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you
Darling, I'd hold you tight
Far from the eyes of night
Under the bridges of Paris with you
I'd make your dreams come true
How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you
Darling, I'd hold you tight
Far from the eyes of night
Under the bridges of Paris with you
I'd make your dreams come true

I weave with brightly colored strings
To keep my mind off other things
So, ladies, let your fingers dance
And keep your hands out of romance
Lovely witches
Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under control
Cut the thread, but leave
The whole heart whole
Merry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only sew and weep
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love
Is playing the fool
Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just
For children in school
I fell in love with love one night
When the mood was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see

I took a choo-choo-choo-choo
Fast as I could take a choo-choo
I came a long, long, long, long way
To take you in my arms
And now it's your first move
To prove that you've been true
Come to baby, do.
You've been a way, way, way, way
Way beyond the blue horizon
I'm hopin' no, no, no, no
No one else is on your mind
So pucker up, my sweet
And meet your Waterloo
Come to baby, do
Stop! Me from guessin'
Tain't no time to tease
Stop! All this messing!
And put your beggin' baby at ease
I wanna love, love, love you
Just the way I wanna love you
I'm gonna try, try, try to make you try to understand
When all is said and done, the one for me is you
Come to baby do
Stop! All this messing!
And put your beggin' baby at ease
I wanna love, love, love you
Just the way I wanna love you
I'm gonna try, try, try to make you try to understand
When all is said and done, the one for me is you
Come to baby do

I am dejected, I am depressed
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
Why this elation, mixed with deflation?
What explanation, I am in love
Such conflicting questions rise
Around in my brain
Should I order cynanide or order champagne?
Oh, what is this sudden jolt?
I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt, I am in love
I knew the odds were against me before
I had no flair for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire
So come and enlighten my days and never depart
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
For I am wildly in love with you
And so in need of a stampede of love
I knew the odds were against me before
I had no flair for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire
So come and enlighten my days and never depart
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
For I am wildly in love with you
And so in need of a stampede of love
And so in need of a stampede of love

Early one morning
As the sun was rising
I heard a voice in the walley below.
Don't decieve me
Don't you leave me
How could you treat
A poor girl so?
Early one morning
I saw her walking
I heard a voice in the walley below.
Don't decieve me
Don't you leave me
How could you treat
A poor boy so?
So I sit on yonder hill
And I wonder if anyone
Thinks of me still
Why did you leave me?
Why did you decieve me?
How could you treat
A poor girl so?
If anyone thinks of me still
Why did you leave me?

Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
The moon up above, and the thing called love
Let me tell you 'bout the stars in the sky
The girl and the guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like this
When I look into your big brown eyes
It's very plain to see
That it's time you learn about the facts in life
Startin' from A to Z
Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
When I look into your big brown eyes...
Well, let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees...
Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
The flowers and the trees
The stars in the sky, a girl and a guy
The birds and the bees
The flowers and the trees
The stars in the sky and a girl and a guy...

I have but one heart
This heart I bring you
I have but one heart
To share with you
I have but one dream
That I can cling to
You are the one dream
I pray comes true
My darling, until I saw you
I never felt this way
And nobody else before you
Ever has heard me say
You are my one love
My life, I live for you
I have but one heart
To give to you

Folks, I've just been down
Down to Memphis town
That's where the people smile
Smile on you all the while
Hospitality
They were good to me
I couldn't spend a dime
And had the grandest time
I went out a-dancing
With a Tennessee dear
They had a fella there named Handy
With a band you should hear
And while the dancers gently swayed
All the band boys played
Real harmony
I never will forget
The tune that Handy called The Memphis Blues
The got a fiddler there
That always slickens his hair
And folks, he sure does pull some bow
And when the big bassoon
Seconds to the trombone's croon
And moans just like a sinner on revival day
Here me, people, hear me, people, hear me, I pray
I'm gonna take a million lessons 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet
Simply can't forget that blues refrain
There's nothing like a Handy band
That played The Memphis Blues so grand
That melancholy strain
Ever haunting refrain
Is like a morning sorrow song
Here comes the very part
That wraps it's spell around my heart
I can't forget the tune
That Handy called The Memphis Blues
I can't forget the tune
That Handy called The Memphis Blues

Out on the plains down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along I heard him singin'
The most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah
Now get along, get hip little doggies
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip little doggies
He trucked 'em on down that old fairway
Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah
[Chorus: x2]
Now singin' his cowboy songs
He's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a dixie
Touch
He was raised on local ways
He's what you call a swingin' half breed
Singin' his Cow Cow Booogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Any time you're feelin' lonely
Any time you're feelin' blue
(You're feelin' blue)
Any time you feel downhearted
That'll prove your love for me is true
Any time you're thinkin' about me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
(Thinkin' of you)
So, any time you say you want me right back again
That is the time I'll come back home to you
(Any time you're feelin' lonely)
(That's any time you're feelin' blue)
Any time you feel downhearted
That'll prove your love for me is true
Oh, any time you're thinkin' about me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So, any time you say you're wantin' me back again
That's the time
(Any time)
That's the time
(That's any time)
Yeah, that's the time
(That's any time)
I'll come back home to you
(Home to you, home to you)

Beautiful eyes, something 'bout the way you look at me
Is making me feel like this is a love for all time
Beautiful eyes, something in your eyes has got me hypnotized
That I wanna stay in this dream for life
You're my wonderful miracle so precious to my heart
I never thought it could be this incredible to have you
(To have you)
In my life you have completed me
You got me, opened me
In love I always wanna see your

(All I need)
To keep me going on from day to day
You're like sunshine and rain

Tears of joy, I cry every time I see your eyes
Beautiful eyes, something 'bout the way you look at me
Is making me feel like this is a love for all time

Don't wanna go nowhere
Just wanna stay right here
Your beautiful eyes
Captivated
(Beautiful eyes, beautiful eyes)

Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me
It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas, may your New Year's dreams come true
And this song of mine in three quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

Let me love you tonight
Let me tell you how much I adore all your charms
Though you leave me tomorrow for this night we'll borrow a love song
Let me love you tonight
Let me thrill to the touch of your sheltering arms
Til the scent of the roses caresses and closes your eyes
Let me kiss you tonight
While the stars in the sky give a heavenly light
So when love is an ember my heart will remember this sight
Live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight
Then forget me darling only
Let me love you tonight
Live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight
Then forget me darling only
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight

whooo
Into some funk
Dance
y'all must quit the set?
cuz when the ship hits your hip
better not try to fight it
'cuz the rip is strong and mighty
when the potion hits your notion
and you start that rollarmotion
it'll make you slip
it'll make you dip
and cause a tingling in your hipbone
or won't you sing it baby
play it on bobby

Where the dreamy Volga flows
There's a lonely Russian rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
Listen
Every night you'll hear her croon
A Russian lullaby
Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry
Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

He's my evil twin. He's the enemy inside me...
It's me against him and I hate his wicked grin
but we're brothers to the end
He will break your heart but I'll do my best
to stop him. He's ticking like a bomb
I adore you but he forks his tounge
I'm just not myself today
Not myself today
I try to smile but the creature lurks
right below I can't keep the lid on
of the enemy in my soul
He tears down all the things I've worked so hard for
I'm gonna get my gun and kill the enemy within
Round and around I go
caught by the undertow
I can't escape myself at Midnight
Footsteps and shadows swirl
the Prince of the Underworld
chases me through the fog at Midnight
..at Midnight
..at Midnight
..at Midnight
I'm just not myself today
I'm just not myself today
Not myself today
I'm just not myself today
Not myself today
He wants you to approve
fears he'll be called a failure
He plays cat and mouse with you
But I don't know who is more the fool
his Jekyll or his Hyde
Fly above the multitudes or just give them
what they're used to
He's lit by candlelight and his quill is filled with blood and spite
Round and around I go
caught by the undertow
I can't escape myself at Midnight
Footsteps and shadows swirl
the Prince of the Underworld
chases me through the fog at Midnight
..at Midnight
..at Midnight
..at Midnight
He's my evil twin
He's my evil twin
He's my evil twin
He's my evil twin
He's my evil twin
He's my evil twin

(She-oop, she-oop, she-oop)
Ain't nothing in the world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
Ooh love, love, love, love, love, love
There ain't nothing in the world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
And that's the only thing I'm thinking of
Love can make you happy when you're feeling blue
If the one you love is in love with you
There's nothing in the world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
Yeah, love, love, love ooh love, love, love
There's nothing ooh love, love, love
And that's the only thing I'm thinking of
(She-oop, she-oop, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(She-oop, she-oop, love, love, love, love, love, love)
That's the only thing I'm thinking of
Love can make you happy when you're feeling blue
If the one you love is in love with you
Ain't nothing in the world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
Yeah love, love, love oh love, love, love
Ain't nothing in the world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
That's the only thing I'm thinking of
That's the only thing I'm thinking of

The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That''s the best work of all if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sighing after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if
Won't you tell me how?

Would I love you
If I thought that you'd love me too
Does a birdie fly
Ooh-ooh-ooh-aah
Would I want you
If I thought thay you'd want me too
Does a baby cry
Yeah-yeah-yeah
(Would I love you)
Each and every day
(Would I love you)
Darling, come what may
(Would I love you)
Ooh-ooh, I would and I do
With a love that is true
Oh, would I kiss you
If I thought that you'd come on and kiss me too
Does a river flow
'N just in case you'd like to know
Would I hold you
And never let you go for my whole life through
Does a fire glow
Oh, my Darlin', Darlin', Darlin'
(Would I love you)
Oh, you don't have to doubt it
(Would I love you)
There's no question about it
(Would I love you)
Darlin', Darlin', Darlin', I would and I do
With a love that is true
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Would I love you)
As long as I'm here, I will
(Would I love you)
For everything that I'm worth
(would I love you)
Just like a flower loves the rain
(Would I love you)
I try to never

The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That anyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of a daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
And your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
I'm living in a kind of a daydream
I'm happy, I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I am near to you
I see your face in every flower
And your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
My love, my love

Giving up
Is hard to do
When you really
Love someone
Giving up
So hard to do
When you still depend upon
Her warm and tender touch
Her kiss and her caress
Ooh, they used to
Mean so much
And bring you happiness
Giving up
So hard to do
I've tried
But it just ain't no use
Giving up
So hard to do
I said I've tried
But it just ain't no use
But my light of hope
Is burning dim
But in my heart I pray
That my love and faith
In the girl
Will bring her back to me
Ooh, whether
Whether she knows or not
She really needs me too
The little girl
Is all I got
Yes she is
And giving up
Giving up is so hard to do

Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few, chosen few
And clover being green
Is something I've never seen
Cause I was born to be blue
When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view, I should view
But moonbeams being gold
Are something I can't behold
Cause I was born to be blue
When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, oh well
I guess I'm luckier than some folks
Woo woo woo
I've known the thrill of lovin' you, lovin' you
And that alone is more than I was created for
Cause I was born to be blue
When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, oh well
I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of lovin' you, lovin' you
And that alone is more than I was created for
Cause I was born to be blue
Woo woo

Once in love with Amy
Always in love with Amy
Ever and ever fascinated by her
Sets your heart on fire to stay
Once you're kissed by Amy
Tear up your list, it's Amy
Ply her with bonbons, poetry and flowers
Moon a million hours away
You might be quite the fickle hearted rover
So carefree and bold
Who loves a girl and later thinks it over
And just quits cold
But once in love with Amy
Always in love with Amy
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her
Trouble is the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay in love with me
You might be quite the fickle hearted rover
So carefree and bold
Who loves a girl and later thinks it over
And just quits cold
But once in love with Amy
Always in love with Amy
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her
Trouble is the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay in love with me

My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts? content
The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on
The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
"summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may"
There ?neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

I'm broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too
I said I'm broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too
Mama, if I clean up, can I go home with you?
I'm motherless, fatherless, sister and brother less too
I said I'm motherless, fatherless, sister and brother less too
Reason I've tried so hard to make this trip with you
You miss me woman, count the days I'm gone
You miss me woman, count the days I'm gone
I'm goin' away to build me a railroad of my own
I feel like jumpin' through a keyhole in your door
I said I feel like jumpin' through the keyhole in your door
If you jump this time, baby, you won't jump no more
I believe my good gal have found my black cat bone
I said I believe my baby have found my black cat bone
I can leave Sunday mornin', Monday mornin' I'm slippin' 'round home
I wanna show you women what careless love have done
I wanna show you women what careless love have done
Caused a man like me, steal away from home
Girl if you don't want me, why don't you let me know?
I said, if you don't want me, mama let me know
So I can leave at once and hunt me somewhere else to go

Dancin' in the dark till the tune ends
We're dancin' in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzin' in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by: we're here and we're gone
Lookin' for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you, love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark
What though love is old
What though song is old
Through them we can be young
Hear this heart of mine
Wailin' all the time
Dear one, tell me that we're one
Lookin' for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you, love
And we can face the music together

Well, we're all searching for peace of mind
Love in this world is hard to find
Come close to me, hold my hand
And warm your heart
Only a true love can satisfy
Open your arms and close your eyes
Walk with me, hold my hand
And warm your heart
Well, you're the reason for the way I'm feeling
Cause I've never felt this way before
I want to make you oh, so happy
That's all I'm living for
Just sorrow, yes, you should know
We need each other
When lights are low
Stay with me, hold my hand
And warm your heart
Well, you're the reason for the way I'm feeling
Cause I've never felt this way before
I want to make you oh, so happy
That's all I'm living for
So come to me and make things right
I'll keep you happy both day and night
Stay with me, hold my hand
And warm your heart

Verse 1
I know it ain't easy
To have to face the unknown
You know we all have our moments in life
Sometimes we all feel alone
Oh now but we've got a union
Beyond all color and race
Each of our journeys is so unique
But it leads us to a common place
Chorus
Don't you understand?
We're the family of man
Listen, I got you, I won't drop you
Hold my hand
Don't you understand?
We're the family of man
Listen, I got you, I won't drop you
Hold my hand
Verse 2
Oh Since we've all got each other
Well then were never alone
Yeah you're my sister my brother
We're family no matter where you're from
There ain't no far away ocean
There ain't no matter of space
No nothing will separate us even though were miles away
Chorus
Bridge
I'm singing joy to the world
Every man boy and every girl
I wish you peace I wish you love
And all the pleasures of the simple things

I am with you
Wandering through memory lane
Living the years laughter and tears over again
I am dreaming yet of the night we met
When life was a lovely refrain
You were so shy saying goodbye there in the dark
Only a glance full of romance and you were gone
Though my dreams are in vain
My love will remain
Strolling again memory lane with you
I am dreaming yet of the night we met
When life was a lovely refrain
You were so shy saying goodbye there in the dark
Only a glance full of romance and you were gone
Though my dreams are in vain
My love will remain
Strolling again memory lane with you

I'm all dressed up
With a broken heart
Pretending I'm with you
Someone else in my arms
Only bring back your charms
It's a game I just can't
Carry through
When I'm alone
And the teardrops start
I realize it's true
I'm all dressed up
With a broken heart
And still in love with you
When I'm alone
And the teardrops start
I realize it's true
I'm all dressed up
With a broken heart
And still in love with you

Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
I know the place to go
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray, for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true
On Christmas Island your dreams come true

Last night I fell asleep all alone
Tossing and turning
Waiting for you to come home
As you walked through that door
I felt it even more
It showed all over your face
For the very first time
I know that I realized my world is not the same
Now that your gone
You're gone
If I've done something wrong
I'd take it back
I just can't stand to see you go
I don't understand just where we went wrong
What happened to our happy home
What am I doing here
Wearing your favorite dress
I've tried everything
But you just don't seem to care
How could it be
I prayed my feelings were wrong
I just can't believe it
You'd leave me here all alone
For the very first time
I know that I realized my world is not the same
Now that your gone
You're gone
If I've done something wrong
I'd take it back
I just can't stand to see you go
I don't understand just where we went wrong
What happenend to our happy home

My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
And my arms long for you
Please, come back to me
If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you
If you're in Minnesota, I'll be there too
You'll have a million chances to start anew
Because my love is endless for you
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please, come back to me
The bloom has left the roses since you left me
The birds have left my window since you left me
I'm lonely as a sailboat that's lost at sea
I'm lonely as a human can be
My heart cries for you
Please, come back to me
An unimportant quarrel is what we had
We have to learn to live with the good and the bad
Together we were happy, apart we're sad
This loneliness is driving me mad
My heart cries for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please, come back to me
(Come back to me)

Hooray for Hollywood
That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood
Where any office boy or young mechanic
Can be a panic, with just a good looking pan
Where any barmaid can be a star maid
If she dances with or without a fan
Hooray for Hollywood
Where you're terrific, if you're even good
Where anyone at all from TV's Lassie
To Monroe's chassis is equally understood
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck
Hooray for Hollywood
Hooray for Hollywood
That phoney, super coney Hollywood
They come from Chillicothes and Padukahs
With their bazookas to get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbons and legs in tights
Hooray for Hollywood
You may be homely in your neighborhood
But if you think that you can an actor
See Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey look good
With a half an hour, you'll look like Tyrone Power
Hooray for Hollywood

I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you

Fools rush in where angels fear to thread
And so I come to you my love, my heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me then I don't care
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love so how are they to know
When we met I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in
When we met I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

places and spaces iv'e been
had a lot of women
seen a lot of land
takes a little while
then you'll understand

I was born in Texas
I was bred in Kansas
When I get married I'll be wed in Kansas
There's a true blue gal who promised she would wait
She's a sunflower from the Sunflower State
She's a sunflower, she's my sunflower
And I know we'll never part
She's my sunflower, she's my one flower
She's a flower of my heart
I was fair in Kansas, clouds are rare in Kansas
Never saw a place that could compare with Kansas
So I'm going home to keep a wedding date
With a sunflower from the Sunflower State
She's a sunflower, she's my sunflower
And I know we'll never part
She's a sunflower, she's my one flower
She's a flower of my heart

I like to sneak a drink and roll my smoke
You see I like my collars pressed
I wear big ol hats and fancy ties
As and I hang late with my friends
I can take it on the chin with a Cheshire grin
I'm a sinner V.I.P
You know I like mixed drinks I likes what I thinks
I think you know just what I mean
You know that heroes and legends are one and the same
It's a how you play the game
You see, I'm no fool I'm from the old school
Its the fire from the flame
I like a big ol car, and fine cigars
You know I'll pick your pockets clean
I'm a snake-eye rollin', big league bowlin'
And I clean up on the green
I got the Jack, the Ace, the King and Queen
You know I like my women mean
'Cause I'm a big time operatin'
Never ever hesitatin' sinner V.I.P
'Cause I'm a big time operatin'
Never ever hesitatin' sinner V.I.P
I like to sneak a drink and roll my smoke

Hoop-De-Do, Hoop-De-Do
I hear a polka and my troubles are through
Hoop-De-Do, Hoop-De-De
This kind of music is like heaven to me
Hoop-De-Do, Hoop-De-Do
It's got me higher than a kite
Hand me down my soup and fish, I am gonna get my wish
Hoop-De-Doin' it tonight
(When there's a trombone playin', ra-ta-da-da-da)
I get a thrill, I always will
(When there's a concertina stretchin' out a mile)
I always smile 'cause that's my style
When there's a fiddle in the middle oh it really is a riddle how he
plays a tune so sweet
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die
Lead me to the floor and hear me yell for more
'cause I'm a Hoop-Dee-Doin' kind of guy
When there's a fiddle in the middle oh it really is a riddle how he
plays a tune so sweet
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die
(Orchestral Break)
Hoop-De-Do, (Hoop-De-Do)
Hoop-De-Doo, (Hoop-De-Do)
I hear a polka
and my troubles are through)
Hoop-De-De, (Hoop-Dee-Do)
Hoop-De-De, (Hoop-De-De)
This kind of music
is like heaven to me
Hoop-De-Do (Hoop-De-Do)
Hoop-De-Do (Hoop-De-Do)
It's got me higher than a kite
I'm in clover, I'm in bloom
When I'm dancin' give me room
Hoop-de-doin' it with all of my might
Rain may fall and snow may come
Nothin's gonna stop me from
Hoop-De-Doin' it tonight

I've seen good men spoil,
Chained to their jobs like hounds
They work and sleep and work again
In their darkest nights, they howl
Their cries are a warning
To everyone following
No man should stand to work all of his days
And have nothing at the end of them.
I've got no money but the change
That jangles in my pockets,
Reminding me how little I have.
And as for time, I am
Powerless to stop it.
It keeps rambling on
Like a mad, wandering man.
My papa was a howlin' man
Traded in his youth
Sold his dreams and all of his days
To the Great American Ruse
My dear papa gave me
Lessons in regret.
He said all that he'd done
Would be for nothing
If I followed in his steps.
I've got no money but the change
That jangles in my pockets,
Reminding me how little I have.
And as for time, I am
Powerless to stop it.
It keeps rambling on
Like a mad, wandering man.
My papa taught me how to howl,
How to bear my teeth and growl.
He taught me that the hand that feeds
Deserves to be bitten when it beats.
He taught me how to break my chains,
And that money ain't worth a thing,
And that no man should get more of my time than me
Than me
I may never be a rich man,
But I can
Make sure that I'm free.
I may never be a rich man,
But the rich man
Will never have me, never have me.
I may never be a rich man,
But I can
Make sure that I'm free.
I may never be a rich man,
But the rich man
Will never have me, never have me.
I've got no money but the change
That jangles in my pockets,
Reminding me how little I have.
And as for time,
As for time
It's mine
It's mine

All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing,
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring
And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night time too
All I do the whole day thru, is dream of you
All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing,
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring
And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night time to

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

I hate to see that evening sun go down,
I hate to see that evening sun go down,
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town.
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today,
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today,
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway.
Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings,
She pulls my man around by her apron strings.
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair,
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere.
I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be,
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea,
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me.
I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie,
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord.
I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord!
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea,
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me.
I got those St. Louis blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, I got the blues,
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea,
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord!

You showed me the way
When I was someone in distress
A heart in search of happiness
You showed me the way
My sky was so gray
I never knew I'd feel a thrill
I couldn't dream a dream until
You showed me the way
The moment you found me
The shadows around me
Just disappeard from view
The world became rosy
Each corner so cozy
Darling, all because of you
You showed me the way
And if I've learned that love can be a paradise
For you and me
Here's all I can say
You showed me the way

A long, long time ago
Shake off your shoes and
Kick off your boots
That's what she said to me
The world is a possibility
You know, know, know
Still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm
Sometimes I'm an invisible me
You can't see, but I can't notice a thing
I am a walk green with your pile of things
Never fit into your plan
Even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
Grandma said when she took me inside
Gonna make minimal changes in life
Gonna make minimal space this time
Just make sure you don't lose your mind
Oh even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm
Find myself and that's for sure
Whether you're rich or whether your poor
And when the hand is broken, open comes the door
Lead tonight, what you waiting for?
Even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
My grandma, man she dead and gone
Me, I'm still travellin' on
Adopt the night phase into dawn
Stars of night fade in the morning time
Even though I've grown old
I still believe in everything she told me
Hmm, mm, mm
You know I am still young
I still believe in everything I've done
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm

You, beyond my dreams
And everything above
Among the stars and love
You shine brighter than it all
My all in one
And for you,
I count the hours, seconds and heartbeats
Because I know I want to spend the rest of my life
Only with you
Love, kisses, synchronicity, timeless and gaps
You are the one
You are my only one
And for you,
I will write endless melodies of love
Because I need someone to harmoize with me
My all in one
Time, age, synchronicity
Missed places, word will never ever
Take your place
In my mind, in my life
My only one
Love, kisses, synchronicity, timeless and gaps
You are the one
You are my only one
You, beyond the dreams
And everything above
Among the stars
I love I love only you
My all in one
My all in one
You are my only one
You are my only one

People getting down to the sound of the underworld
People getting down to the sound of the underworld
Getting down, down
People getting down to the sound of the underworld
Two minutes left, two minutes left
Getting down, getting down
Getting down, getting down
Two minutes left, two minutes left

I was looking hard for love then I found you
And when I found you I just couldn't help but fall
You wrapped your arms around me
Ran your magic up and down me, now I can finally say I've got it all
But I can't say it came easy but it's easy since it came
Now I can finally just lay back and smile
And I realize it may not last forever but I sure do like this style
'Cause it feels good having it real good for a while
I tried so hard I feel like I deserve it
To have someone I need as much as you
The feel for love you taught me, it comes each time you want me
And leaves my body soft when you are through
But I can't say it came easy but it's easy since it came
Now I can finally just lay back and smile
And I realize it may not last forever but I sure do like this style
'Cause it feels good having it real good for a while
No I can't say it came easy but it's easy since it came
Now I can finally just lay back and smile
And I realize it may not last forever but I sure do like this style
'Cause it feels good having it real good for a while
Yes it feels good having it real good
Yes it feels good having it real good
Yes it feels good having it real good

A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue
Hoping to run into
The very sight of you coming my way.
I stop just in front of our door
But you're never there any more
So back to my room
And here in the gloom
I cry tears of goodbye
Til you come back to me
That's the way it will be
Everyday in the life of a fool

For miles
Only
Wind and water
Sweep
Roar
And now try to look
Through the mist
And...
Strain my eyes
To see what
Is behind
A fading memory
Little old
Weary man
Walk in my mind
Fading memory
The dew
Shines upon
The lotus blossom
On the heavy grass
A child dances

Full speed ahead
Rock 'n' roll is dead
The girls and boys from the Mickey Mouse Club
Clocked it in the head
TV makes people so tired
Bored as a bird on a wire
I check the pulse and I light a match
And then I set the telly on, I set the telly on fire
Tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause it really seems to me
Bonafide is the old deal, fake is the new real
Take a bite out of crime
Long as it's not on your dime
If honesty will put you in jail you'd know that
We're livin' in phony times
You say you wanna get turned on
Is it worth the Honda car
You take a moment and kick yourself
And then you drop yourself, you drop yourself a bomb
Tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause it really seems to me
Bonafide is the old deal, fake is the new real
Tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause it really seems to me
Bonafide is the old deal, fake is the new real
Tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause it really seems to me
Bonafide is the old deal, fake is the new real
Tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause it really seems to me
Bonafide is the old deal, fake is the new real
Tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal
'Cause it really seems to me
Bonafide is the old deal, fake is the new real
Fake is the new real
Fake is the new real

Please baby, let's get it right
I don't think, I can take it, one more night
I know I love you, I love you, I love you
Though the stars are mine
So please, please baby, show me you are mine
Please baby, let's not fight
I don't think, I can take it, one more night
I know I love you, I love you, I love you
Though the stars are mine
So please, please baby, show me you are mine
Please baby, let's get it right
Wanna make love to you baby, all through the night
I know I love you, I love you, I love you
Though the stars are mine
So please, please baby, show me you are mine
Show me you are mine
Show me you are mine
Show me you are mine

Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Some kind of laid back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

If dreams come true
I'll be with you
I love that smile in your eyes
You see a dream in the skies
In your caress there is happiness
And love in view
If dreams come true

Pretending that we'll meet
Each time I turn a corner
I walk a little faster
Pretending life is sweet
'Cause love is around the corner
I walk a little faster
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
Rushing toward a face I can't divine as yet
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls
But even though I meet
At each and every corner
With nothing but disaster
I set my chin a little higher, hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
Rushing toward a face I can't divine as yet
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls
But even though I meet
At each and every corner
With nothing but disaster
I set my chin a little higher, hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster

Somethings going on
Somethings going wrong
Something feeling mighty bad
And its making us all feel so so sad
Because the people they open their mouths
And nothing but lies fall out
They keep on talking round and round
Pacify the crowd
But this song has been, sung about, many times before
I got hunger, I got hunger
I got hunger, I got hunger
I got hunger, I got hunger
I got hunger
Somethings always telling me
I fall so hard I can hardly breathe
Citizens of the earth take flight
and Seen as one with all our might
So many rules and regulations
They're putting us in our place
They say it makes us comfortable
They say it keeps us safe!
But it only makes things scary, And fills us full of fear
I got hunger, I got hunger
I got hunger, I got hunger
I got hunger, I got hunger
I got hunger
(we got to work together)
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Because people they open their mouths
And then nothing but lies spill out
Then they keep on, they keep on talking round and round
They are trying to pacify the crowd
So many rules and regulations
They're trying to put us in our place
They will make us feel so comfortable
And then they will say it keeps us safe
But it only makes things scary, And pours us full of fear
got to work together, we got to work together
got to work together, we got to work together

Oh, baby, don't you wanna go?
Oh, yeah, baby, don't you wanna go?
Back to land of California now
Sweet home Chicago
One and one is one, two and two is four
Guess 'round here baby, you know I gotta go
Cryin', baby, don't you wanna go?
Same old place, sweet home Chicago
Care to get along, so you all bang your heart
Would come to sleep, but don't let me get me 'bout
Cryin', baby, don't you wanna go?
Same old place, sweet home Chicago
One and one is one, two and two is four
Guess 'round here, baby, you know I got to go
Cryin', baby, don't you wanna go?
Same old place, sweet home Chicago

Well, good morning, baby, welcome back to town
How do, fine papa, welcome back to town
You're doing so much traveling
Never know when you'll be around
You're a fine and mellow fellow
But you're stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel
But you treat me like a fool
Two faced daddy
Don't hand me no double cross
You'll see any time I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
You're cheating on the outside
Doing anything you choose
You better come back on the inside
'Cause you've got too much to lose
Don't want no trouble
I've got to be the boss
And if you can't play it my way
Well, now baby get lost
I try to stop your cheating
But I just don't have the time
'Cause I've got so many men
That they're standing right in line
Keep cool papa
You got to come across
'Cause any time I'm ready
Yes, any time I'm ready
You know when I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
Why don't you get lost?

Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
You know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Every night I sit here by my window (window)
Staring at the lonely avenue (avenue)
Watching lovers holdin' hands
And laughin' (ha ha ha)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
Memories are all I have to cling to (cling to)
And heartaches are the friends
I'm talkin' to (but you got me now)
When I'm not thinkin' of just how much
I love you ('bout I love you, too)
I'm thinkin' the things we used to do
(Used to do, thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' about the things we used to do
I still can hear the juke box softly
Playin' (playin')
And the face I see each day belongs to you
(Belongs to you)
But there's not a single sound
And there's nobody else around
But that's just me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(We used to do, thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night that we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' about the things we used to do
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
You got me thinkin' 'bout
The things we used to do (I hope so)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Listen to me, Sophia,
Have you any idea
How much you mean to me-a?
How much you'll never know!
If I'm all agitato,
Every heart string vibrato,
Every look passionato,
Who but you made me so?
It's love, it's love crescendo,
Never ever diminuendo.
Say the word, sweet Sophia,
Or from earth I resign.
Oh, Sophia, be mine!
Listen to me, Sophia,
Have you any idea
How much you mean to me-a?
Every day more and more!
All the others were so-so,
Not a one amoroso,
But with you I'm aglow, so,
Only you I adore.
You're sweeter than spumone,
Sweeter even than Zabaglione.
Say the word, sweet Sophia,
Or from earth I resign
Oh, Sophia, be mine!
Oh, Sophia, be mine!

When it rains five days and the skies turn dark as night
When it rains five days and the skies turn dark as night
Then trouble's takin' place in the lowlands at night
I woke up this mornin', can't even get out of my door
I woke up this mornin', can't even get out of my door
There's been enough trouble to make a poor girl wonder where she want to go
Then they rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the pond
Then they rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the pond
I packed all my clothes, throwed them in and they rowed me along
When it thunders and lightnin' and when the wind begins to blow
When it thunders and lightnin' and the wind begins to blow
There's thousands of people ain't got no place to go
Then I went and stood upon some high old lonesome hill
Then I went and stood upon some high old lonesome hill
Then looked down on the house were I used to live
Backwater blues done call me to pack my things and go
Backwater blues done call me to pack my things and go
'Cause my house fell down and I can't live there no more
Mmm, I can't move no more
Mmm, I can't move no more
There ain't no place for a poor old girl to go

It's June in January
Because I'm in love
It always is spring in my heart
With you in my arms
The snow is just white blossoms
That fall from above
And here is the reason, my dear
Your magical charms
The night is cold
The trees are bare
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air
It's June in January
Because I'm in love
But only because I'm in love with you
(The night is cold)
(The trees are bare)
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air
It's June in January
Because I'm in love
But only because I'm in love with you

Well, what do you know, he smiled at me in my dreams last night
My dreams are getting better all the time
And, what do you know, he smiled at me in a different light
My dreams are getting better all the time
To think that we were strangers a couple of nights ago
And though it's a dream, I never dreamed he'd ever say hello
Oh, maybe tonight I'll hold him tight when the moonbeams shine
My dreams are getting better all the time
To think that we were strangers a couple of nights ago
And though it's a dream, I never dreamed he'd ever say hello
Oh, maybe tonight I'll hold him tight when the moonbeams shine
My dreams are getting better all the time

I left my hat in Haiti
In some forgotten flat in Haiti
I couldn't tell you how I got there
I only know it was so hot there
She took my hat politely
And wound her arms around me tightly
But I remember nothing clearly
Except the flame when she came near me
Her eyes had the glow of surrender
And her touch it was tender
And with someone as fiery as that
You forget about your hat
So if you go to Haiti
There is a girl I know in Haiti
If you can find her you'll adore her
Just look around till you've found someone who has a blue-grey fedora
Her eyes had the glow of surrender
And her touch it was tender
And with someone as fiery as that
You forget about your hat
So if you go to Haiti
There is a girl I know in Haiti
If you can find her you'll adore her
Just look around till you've found someone who has a blue-grey fedora

I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh, how I want to go home!
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City,
And I dreamed about those cotton fields at home.
I dreamed about my mother,
Dear old Papa, Sister and brother,
I dreamed about that girl
Who's been waiting for so long.
I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh, how I want to go home!
Home, folks think I'm big in Detroit City.
From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine.
But by day, I make the cars,
And by night I make the bars,
If only they could read between the lines!
[Spoken]
You know,
I rode a freight train north to Detroit City.
After all these years,
I find that I've just been wastin' my time.
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride,
Put on a south bound freight and ride,
Goin' back to the love ones,
The ones I left waitin' so far behind.
I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh, how I want to go home.

"Have you met Miss Jones?" someone said as we shook hands,
She was just Miss Jones to me.
And then I said, "Miss Jones, you're a girl who understands
I'm a man who must be free."
And all at once I lost my breath, and all at once was scared to death,
And all at once I owned the earth and sky.
And now I've met Miss Jones, and we'll keep on meeting till we die,
Miss Jones and I.
(musical interlude)
And all at once I lost my breath, and all at once was scared to death,
And all at once I owned the earth and the sky.
Now I've met Miss Jones, and we'll keep on meeting till we die,
Miss Jones and I, Miss Jones and I, Miss Jones and I.

Like one more time if our love ever grows cold
And this new thrill somehow grows old
Oh, when forever for us is no more
Don't tell our friends, baby
Let me be the first to know
When you no longer care
When my dreams, you no longer share
Tell me before it starts to show
You don't have to be ashamed
Just let me be the first to know
You love me now, I feel kind of sure
Kind of sure somehow
But in this game of romance
Forever, forever is a million to one chance
Ooh Lord, when my kiss becomes an everyday thing
And my voice becomes just a busy ring
Let me put on my disguise before you go break my heart
But leave my pride

I heard it came to town
A new kind of rhythm
Spread around
Sort of set you sizzlin'
Now I'm all through with symphony
Oh, rock it for me
Every night
You'll see all the nifties
Plenty tight
Swingin' down the fifties
Now they're all through with symphony
Ho ho ho, rock it for me
Now it's true that once upon a time
The opera was the thing
But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
So won't you satisfy my soul
With the rock and roll?
You can't be tame
While the band is playin'
It ain't no shame
To keep your body swayin'
Beat it out in the minor key
Ho ho ho, rock it for me
Can't you hear me singin', la-la-la-la-la
While the band is swingin'
Oh, Chick Webb's sockin'
And the band is rockin'
So send me lightly, politely
Brightly, and slightly
Ho ho ho, rock it for me
Now I'm all through with this stuff they call symphony
Come on, boys, and sorta rock it for me
It's true that once upon a time
The opera was the thing
But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
So won't you satisfy my soul
With the rock and roll?
You can't be tame
While the band is playin'
It ain't no shame
To keep your body swayin'
Beat it out in the minor key
Oh, rock it
Oh, rock it
Say, won't you rock it for me?
Why even all the nifties they don't want to hear any more symphony
I'm tellin' you, Jack, you better get hip for yourself and rock it for me

[Chorus:]
You've got to feel the need in me
[Repeat x 4]
Alone I feel at times wondering if you're truly mine
Can't you see the tears falling from my eyes
Can't you feel the pain I feel deep inside
My heart seems to bleed when I feel the need
To hold you in my arms and you pull away
Now I may be wrong but my feelings just don't lie
About this emptiness down deep inside, that's why
[Chorus x 3]
When you're around you make me feel so good
All of my worries are far away
Then other times you feel so cold
What makes you treat me this way
[Chorus x 4]
Everybody say that I got to be a fool
I got to be crazy for lovin' you
And I'm starting to wonder if there is truth in what they say
My mind says to leave you, but my heart says I better stay
I want to feel like I'm something more than a passing though from you
I need to know that the things you say are true
I want that sweet, sweet love to fill me up inside
And let our two hearts come together for all times
I do not say things that I don't mean
If I do not love you I'd let you know
If I am not right for you
Won't you tell me so
Before you break my heart in two
[Chorus x 5]

Come to me my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
[introduction to Dean Martin's 15 minute radio spot]
Or else I shall be melancholy too
[introduction to a new Dean Martin number "Till Then"]

Love me, love me
Love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one chorus
Satisfy this hungriness
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
When you kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You cling to me
All things to me
Don't you know your life it's so
Like a leaf clings to a tree
So my darling cling to me
Let my love flow through you
Wild as the wind
Wild as the wind
As the wind
Wilder than the wind my love is
Wild as the wind
Let my heart love you, oh, oh
As the wind
Wild as the wind
Wild creature of the wind
Love me wild again
The wind

It seems like only yesterday
I sailed from out of Cork
A wanderer from Erin's isle
I landed in New York
There wasn't a soul to greet me there
A stranger on your shore
But Irish luck was with me here
And riches came galore
And now that I'm going back again
To dear old Erin's isle
My friends will meet me on the pier
And greet me with a smile
Their faces, sure, I've almost forgot
I've been so long away
But me mother will introduce them all
And this to me will say
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy
And here is your sister, Kate
And there's the girl you used to swing
Down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbours
And kiss the colleens all
You're as welcome as the flowers in May
To dear old Donnegal
They'll give a party when I go home
They'll come from near and far
They'll line the roads for miles and miles
With Irish jauntin' cars
The spirits'll flow and we'll be gay
We'll fill your hearts with joy
The piper'll play an Irish reel
To greet the Yankee boy
We'll dance and sing the whole night long
Such fun as never seen
The lads'll be decked in corduroy
The colleens wearin' green
There'll be thousands there that I never saw
I've been so long away
But me mother will introduce them all
And this to me will say
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy
And here is your sister, Kate
And there's the girl you used to swing
Down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbors
And kiss the colleens all
You're as welcome as the flowers in May
To dear old Donnegal
Meet Branigan, Fannigan, Milligan, Gilligan
Duffy, McCuffy, Malachy, Mahone
Rafferty, Lafferty, Donnelly, Connelly
Dooley, O'Hooley, Muldowney, Malone
Madigan, Cadigan, Lanihan, Flanihan
Fagan, O'Hagan, O'Hoolihan, Flynn
Shanihan, Manihan, Fogarty, Hogarty
Kelly, O'Kelly, McGuinness, McGuinn
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy
And here is your sister, Kate
And there's the girl you used to swing
Down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbors
And kiss the colleens all
You're as welcome as the flowers in May
To dear old Donnegal

When the sunrise in the east, lover
It set deeply in the west
Yeah, the sunrise in the east
It set deeply in the west
I've been lookin' for my lover
An' I haven't found her yet
I'm gonna call up China
An' see if my woman's over there
Well, I'm gonna call up China
An' see if my woman's over there
You know, I've searched the whole world over, Lord
I can't find my lover, nowhere (hey-ya)
She won't write me no letter
She won't even call me on the telephone
No, she won't write me no letter
She won't even call me on the telephone
You know I haven't had no real good lovin'
Since that gal-a mine been gone
(Spoken:
I can't see my, engineer
Hey, somebody! (hey, hey)
Where's Mister ...
Well, Ooh!)
Someday baby, hahahaha
You're gonna want me, like I want you
Oh, someday baby, you're gonna want me, like I want you
But when you call me long distance, darlin'
I'll say I have nothing for you to do
Someday baby, you're gonna want me, like I want you
Hey, someday baby, you're gonna want me, like I want you
Oh, but when ya call me on the phone, angel
I'll say I have nothin' for you to do
Woo, thank you!

The faucet it is dripping and the fence is falling down
My pocket needs some money so I can't go in to town
My brother he ain't working and my sister doesn't care
The car it needs a motor so I can't go anywhere
Manana Manana
Manana is soon enough for me
Once I had some money but I gave it to a friend
He said he'd pay me double he was only for a lend
But he said a little later that the horse it was so slow
Why he gave the horse my money is something I don't know
Manana Manana
Manana is good enough for me
My brother took his suitcase and he went away to school
My father said he only learned to be a silly fool
My father said that I should learn to make a chili pot
But then I burned the house down the chili was too hot
Manana Manana
Manana is soon enough for me
The window it is busted and the rain is coming in
If someone doesn't fix it I'll be soaking to my skin
But if we wait a day or two the rain may go away
And we don't need a window on such a lovely day
Manana manana manana is soon enough for me
Manana manana manana is soon enough for me

You know Dasher and Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
You know Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
Say, but do you recall
That most important reindeer of all?
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
But then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history."
Rock it, Rudolph
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

I never learned to spell,
At least not well.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
I never learned to count,
A great amount.
But my busy mind is burning to use what learning I`ve got,
I won`t waste any time,
I`ll strike while the iron is hot.
If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk, and whisper, and look.
I could write a preface
On how we met
So the world would never forget.
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot.
And the world discovers
As my book ends,
How to make two lovers
Of friends.
And the simple secret of the plot

An old sailor, in old time, would sing an old song
Rolling down to Rio by the sea
A young sailor, in these times, would sing a new song
Flying down to Rio, come with me!
Where the lovely Brazilian ladies will catch your eye
By the light of the million stars in the evening sky
My Rio, Rio by the Sea-o
Flying down to Rio where there's rhythm and rhyme
Hey feller, twirl that old propeller
Got to get to Rio and we've got to make time
You'll love it, soaring high above it
Looking down on Rio from a heaven of blue
Send a radio to Rio de Janeiro
With a big hello just so they'll know and stand by there
We'll fly there
Oh, Rio, ev'rything will be okay
We're singing and winging our way to you
You'll love it, soaring high above it
Looking down on Rio from a heaven of blue
Send a radio to Rio de Janeiro
With a big hello just so they'll know and stand by there
We'll fly there
Oh, Rio, ev'rything will be okay
We're singing and winging our way to you

It's easier to say I love you than tonda wanda hoy comma kalai
And wouldn't you rather say I love you than tonda wanda hoy comma kalai
It's easier to spell kiss me dear than tonda wanda hoy comma kalai
And wouldn't you rather hear kiss me than (tonda wanda hoy comma kalai)
To quote a famous Yale professor
Osculation is a sensation that is nice (so nice)
If you should ask a Harvard lawyer

What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love

You see this guy, this guy's in love with you
Yes I'm in love who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell it know each other very
well
How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you 'cause
I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
This guy's in love and what I'd do to make you mine
Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking
'cause
I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy, if not I'll
just die
Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking
'cause
I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my girl, if not I'll
just die

The one who has me for his own
Is on the town and I'm alone;
In his blue suit and his new tie
He slammed the door without goodbye!
Tonight my eyes are jealous green,
Tonight I'm melancholy mean!
He meets, in secret rendezvous,
Some dame to tell his troubles to,
The heel!
He'll promise her most anything,
A sable coat, a diamond ring;
She'll find him out when it's too late,
And all she gets will be a date!
But while the dawn's a distant thing,
In his embrace her heart will sing;
Her dizzy head will spin with lies,
And all too soon a woman cries,
"The heel!".
The neon lights that flash below
Ignite my room with double glow;
And in the room I hear a laugh,
It's coming from his photograph!
I ring my hands and walk the floor,
And swear to even up the score!
For where a kitten cried tonight,
A panther waits to claw and bite
The heel!
I dare not play my radio,
One more complaint and out I go!
I'm sick of playing solitaire,
The ace of spades is everywhere!
There'll be no sleep for me tonight,
The sheep I count are never white!
They all turn out to be jet black,
And who's the leader of the pack?
The heel!
At dawn I know he'll stagger in,
Demanding coffee black as sin,
And as I take it from the tin,
I slip a little powder in!
He'll look at me and start to cry,
And cross his heart and hope to die!
And mumble "I know how you feel,
But I've been on a business deal!",
The heel!
Then as the pot begins to perk,
I know my plan will never work!
But when he starts to drink it up,
I'll grab his hand and break the cup!
It's only jealousy, I know,
That brought my thinking down so low!
Why must I wait for him and grieve?
Why don't I just pack up and leave
The heel?!
But no he's really on the stair,
I'll try to act like I don't care!
For in my heart's arithmetic
I find it takes two heels to click!
We're in a web of love and hate,
Where it will end is up to fate!
I'll let him have his little fling;
I'll be the chewing gum that clings
To the heel!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral
Seems there is someone at my side
Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?
Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?
Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?
Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral
There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars

Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets,
You know, my little coquette, I love you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Now, maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets,
Now, you know, my little coquette, I love you.

Oh! Baia-yah
When twilight is deep in the sky,
Baia-yah! Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie,
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you, calls to you

In our hands we held
The blue horizon
Buring bright it seemed
For always
Empty in the moment
Of destruction
Sad that we had seen this wonder
Disappear
Hey, hey, how many days?
Hey, hey

Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know
You know even then
That someday you'll see her
Again and again
Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing
Across a crowded room
And night after night
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams
Who can explain it
Who can tell you why
Fools give reasons
Wise men never try
Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love
When you feel her call you
Across a crowded room
Then fly to her side
And make her your own
Or all through your life
You may dream all alone
Once you have found her
Never let her go
Once you have found her
Never let her go

Down here the river meets the sea
In the sticky heat I feel you open up to me
Love comes out of no where, baby,
Oh, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Lying underneath the stars right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are,
And how do you do, how do you do baby
Oh, the clouds roll in across the moon,
And the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
We never gonna make that bridge tonight, baby
Set across the Poncetrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Batten down the hatches, baby
Leave your heart out on your sleeve
Looks like we're in for stormy,
Stormy, stormy weather
That ain't no cause to leave
Just like
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Baby can you feel it, can you feel it
It feels like rain
Baby, can you feel it, can you feel it
Feels like rain
Let your love, let your love come down
Oh, down on me

You're a black butterfly
With your wings frayed and torn,
Laughter's your's so is scorn
As they point to you in shame.
You're a black butterfly
With your wings near fire,
But confess when your tire,
Is the candle worth the flame?
Your Queen of the Night
But with morning's early light
There's not a hear to really call your own;
So before it's too late,
Change your ways and repent,
Take my love that was meant
For black butterfly along.
You're a black butterfly

He's got a sharkskin suit
And a diamond earring he's got jet black hair
Just like his mother
He's got a jail tattoo, from his long-lost brother
He's got a shotgun fuse, don't you pull his trigger
Broke from jail without a gun
Public enemy number one killed a man on the run
On the lam without bail headed straight back to jail
Nowhere else for him to go daddy-o, daddy-o
He's gonna make his mark at a vegas hotel
He rolls snake eyes down
He's gonna make his money
But he's headin' west, on a killin' spree
Down in L.A., you know the killin's free
Broke from jail without a gun
Public enemy number one killed a man on the run
On the lam without bail headed straight back to jail
Nowhere else for him to go daddy-o, daddy-o
He was born on the 4th of july the kind of guy
When he spoke to you
He stared you straight in the eye you know, man
When he walked into the room you would feel it
And man when he walked in the room
It sounded like this
He got a hundred years, and the electric chair
His final words were, I don't care
Broke from jail without a gun
Public enemy number one killed a man on the run
On the lam without bail headed straight back to jail
Nowhere else for him to go daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy-o
Daddy-o
Daddy-o
The way the legend goes is he was executed shortly after midnight
Some witnesses say, he seemed to be enjoying himself
One witness said he died with a smile on his face
He was one bad, bad man

I'm superior, you're inferior
I'm the big attraction you're the small
I'm the major one you're the minor one
I can beat you singing that's not all
Anything you can do I can do better
I can do anything better than you
No you can't yes I can
No you can't yes I can
No you can't yes I can yes I can
(Are we running over) (You're cheating)
Well anything you can be I can be greater (I don't think so)
Sooner or later I'm greater than you
(No you're not) Yes I am
(Nah, you're not) (Yes I am yes I am)
I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge
I can get a sparrow with a bow and arrow
I can live on bread and cheese (and only that)
Yes (So can a rat)

I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care!
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!
I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care!
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,

Love was blown away by the night wind
And the dream we shared fell apart
Now I'm all alone in the night wind
Wind that brought the blues to my heart
Yesterday my arms were around you
And your lips revealed you were mine
Then the angry wind came and found you
Came to end the moment divine
Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't want me
Why is lover's lane filled with shadows
Stars no longer shine up above
I'll be waiting there in the shadows
'Til the night wind brings back our love
Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't, you don't want me
Why is lover's lane filled with shadows
Stars no longer shine up above
I'll be waiting there in the shadows
'Til the night wind brings back our love
I'll be waiting there, let you know I care
'Til that night wind brings back our love

Innamorata
Dean Martin
If our lips should meet Innamorata
Kiss me kiss me sweet Innamorata
Hold me close and say you're mine
With a love as warm as wine
I'm at heaven's door Innamorata
Want you more and more Innamorata
You're a symphony the very beautiful sonanta my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love
You're a symphony the very beautiful sonanta my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my one and only sweetheart
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love

Cigarette holder which wigs me
Over her shoulder she digs me
Out cattin' that satin doll
Baby, shall we go out skippin'?
Careful, amigo, you're flippin'
Speaks Latin that satin doll
She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me
Swich-e-rooney
Telephone numbers well you know
Doing my rhumbas with uno
And that's my satin doll

Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low
Dear, we're so close together I love you so
Why think about the weather
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms
Our lips meeting soft and tender
Love's all aglow
Why shouldn't we surrender
When lights are low
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low
Dear, we're so close together I love you so
Why think about the weather
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms
Our lips meeting soft and tender
Love's all aglow
Why shouldn't we surrender
When lights are low

Tell me which road are you traveling
Which road are you traveling on
Tell me who you will turn to
When the light has gone
I hear somebody calling
I hear somebody calling to me
With so many roads to travel
There's just one can set you free
There's just one road
One road to freedom
There's just one road
One road to freedom
Just one
In my life I have been blessed
In my life I have been cursed
I have lived the best of times
I have suffered the worst
Do you know which road you're traveling
Do you know where you want to be
With so many roads to travel
There's just one can set you free
There's just one road
One road to freedom
There's just one road
One road to freedom
There's just one road
One road to freedom
Just one

Well it's lonesome in this old town
Everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name
Just walking in the rain
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got holes in both of my shoes
Well I'm a walking case of the blues
Saw a dollar yesterday
But the wind blew it away
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I haven't eaten in about a week
I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend
It's sad the shape I'm in
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got a girl waiting there for me
Well at least she said she'd be
I got a home and a big warm bed
And a feather pillow for my head
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.
Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.
And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.
People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.
Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.
People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.
Let the time go by
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live,
Let me be on the street where you live.

Back in the beginning the days flew by so fast
Well, we hung on every moment like we thought it would be the last
And every breath I drew, I drew it just for you
Now I don't know what to do to keep you beside me
And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
Time was on our side
And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
But now it seems we're running out of time
And now we're always working, talking on the telephone
You're always going your way and baby, I go my own
Remember when we promised, we'd never let it come to this
But somehow we just missed our happy ever after
And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
Time was on our side
And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
But now it seems we're running out of time
I've been so cold, I've been unkind
Oh, well, I left you alone, selfish and blind
But baby, I'm coming home, is there still time
To make it up to you
And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
'Cause time was on our side
And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
Time was
What a time it was
What a time it was
What a time it was

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory
You wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night
Once again I'll hold you tight
Though you're gone your love lives on
When moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Love we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat
Love we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

Some children see him
Lily white
The baby Jesus
Born this night
Some children see him
Lily white
With tresses soft
And fair
Some children see him
Bronzed and brown
The Lord of heaven
To Earth come down
Some children see him
Bronzed and brown
With dark
And heavy hair
Some children see him
Almond-eyed
This savior whom
We kneel beside
Some children see him
Almond-eyed
With skin
Of yellow hue
Some children see him
Dark as they
Sweet Mary's son
To whom we pray
Some children see him
Dark as they
And, ah
They love him, too
The children
In each different place
Will see
The baby Jesus' face
Like theirs
But bright
With heavenly grace
And filled
With holy light
Oh lay aside
Each earthly thing
And with thy heart
As offering
Come worship now
The infant king
'Tis love
That's born tonight

That I love you so
Awake or sleeping
My hearts's in your keeping
And calling to you soft and low
My wonderful one
Whenever I'm dreaming
Love's lovelight a-gleaming I see
My wonderful one
How my arms ache to hold, dear
To cuddle and fold you to me
Just you, only you
In the shadowy twilight
In silvery moonlight
There's none like you, I adore you
My life I'll live for you,
Oh, my wonderful, wonderful one
