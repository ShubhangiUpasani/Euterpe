All my life
It's changing every day
In every possible way
And all my dreams
Never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems
I know I've felt like this before
And now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
I know I've felt like this before
And now I'm feeling it even more
'Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
Dream to me
Dream to me...
All my life
It's changing every day
In every possible way
And all my dreams
Never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems
I know I've felt like this before
And now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
I know I've felt like this before
And now I'm feeling it even more
'Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
Dream to me
Dream to me

I've been searching for reason and I'm running out of time
I can feel that it's the season
Time to make up my mind
And I can't really tell ya what I'm gonna do
There are so many thoughts in my head
There are two roads to walk down
And one road to choose
So I'm thinking over the things that you've said
I'm thinking over the things
Thinking over, thinking over
Thinking over the things that you've said
I'm thinking over, thinking over, thinking over the things
Am I ready for forever
Oh, God, show me a sign
Cause if we're to be together
Then it's got to be divine
And I can't really tell ya what I'm gonna do
There are so many thoughts in my head
There are two roads to walk down
And one road to choose
So I'm thinking over the things that you've said
I'm thinking over the things
Thinking over, thinking over
Thinking over the things that you've said
I'm thinking over, thinking over, thinking over the things
He wants to marry me, carry me far away
He wants to love me for life
He wants to be with me every morning I awake
He wants to hold me through the night
Father, which way should I go?
I cannot clearly see
And, oh, I love him so
But only you know if he's the one for me
Thinking over, thinking over
Thinking over the things that you've said
I'm thinking over, thinking over, thinking over the things
And I can't really tell ya what I'm gonna do
There are so many thoughts in my head
There are two roads to walk down
And one road to choose
So I'm thinking over the things that you've said
Oh, is this where I want to be?
Thinking over the things that you said

Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring
Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring
Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
Holy Moses our hearts are screaming
Souls are lifting only dreaming
We'll be waiting some are praying
For a time when no one's cheating
The sunlight rising over the horizon
Just a distant memory a dawn chorus
Birds singing bells ringing
In our hearts in our minds
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep

Talking is useless when your cards have all been shown
I'll make you feel bitter and I'll never use the phone
'Cause I'm not the kind of person soft enough to cry
I'm not the kind of person to hide when I can fight
So breakout now let the feelings out and take the blame away
And leave the past for another day
Please no more talk today
'Cause I'm not the kind of person to hang around
I'm not the kind of person to sympathise with self indulgence
Breakout now let the feelings out and take the blame away
And leave the past for another day
Please no more talk today
Talking is stupid now my interest has flown
I'll make you feel useless if you call me on the phone
Breakout now let the feelings out and take the blame away
And leave the past for another day
Please no more talk today

She's a little girl
In a rich man's world
Everything she'll do
She'll do for you
He's a monster mash
Living on fame and cash
Badly spoiled
A loving dad
Some might say just give it up
There's no more hope, no fair
Move the limits
Ooh wake up the animal in you
Some might say just give it up
There's no more hope, no fair ?
Move the limits
Ooh wake up the animal in you
Girl, can't you see?
Come on now, set him free
Try open up his eyes
And make him realize his misery
He do not care
Sittin' over there
Get up, stand up now
Wake up the animal inside of you
I think it should be inside

" (??)"
Something is reaching out for you.Opposites of struggeling, it seams strange justLike they would grab you and use you their wayAnd change your mind within.
You're sure you hate them, but you're sure that they return.
They leave you sitting separate, they show you no concern.
But they are afraid because they have to go back
To the place where they all shall burn.
Once more you're talking in your sleep.
You're whispering my name.
Once more you're frightened as a child.
Your mind has been altered again.
Your skin is pale and your travelling with fear.
Fight back or they're gonna win.
Spirits from beyond has tempered with your brain.
Wake up before you go insane.
"Did you ask her to marry you during a sexual intercourse?"
" Did you?"
Don't mess with evil forces, there are spirits everywhere.
(??)
They have faith in the holy one.

[Chorus:]
Wanna be the one to hold ya
Wanna be the one to move ya
Wanna be the one to make all your dreams come true
Wanna be the one who needs ya
Wanna be the one who loves ya
Wanna be the one you wanna be with every night
Lying in bed
I see images of you and me
You're always in my head
These feelings won't end
I need more of you every single day
So say that you'll stay
Say that you'll stay
[Repeat Chorus]
There is no doubt
You're exactly all I'll ever need
I want you night and day
I'll cherish the love
You're giving me so tenderly
I'll give you all I can
Give you all I am oh yeah
[Repeat Chorus Twice]
Oooh yeahhh...
[Bridge]
[Spoken] I wanna be the one
to hold you (I wanna be)

I wanna be the one to move you
I wanna be the one who needs you
I wanna be the one who loves you
[Repeat Chorus]
Wanna be the one to hold you

Wanna be the one who loves you (who needs you)
Wanna be the one you wanna be with, every night
I wanna be, I wanna be
Ooooh, no no yeah...
I wanna be, I wanna be

Believing the world revolves around you
While you are squirming like a worm
Defying the laws of recognition
To take the pill to vaccinate the germ
I'd call out your name
But I don't believe they'll ever hear me again
Sweet kerosene
Soak your way through me
Sparks from machines
Light to heat up my cold dead hands tonight
To heat up my cold dead hands tonight
Destroying the beauty that surrounds you
To find the face that made you what you are
Dissecting the heart of admiration
To prove you cannot hide the scars
I'd call out your name
But I don't believe that you'll hear me again
Sweet kerosene
Soak your way through me
Sparks from machines
Light to heat up my cold dead hands tonight
To head up my cold dead hands tonight
Think you can break me
You'll never take me alive

Stood up at a border street
A souped up strut on swollen feet
My loss remembered incomplete
What memory knows I can't repeat
Offered army soul salvation
Sandwich choice of God and nation
Haloed voices, chiselled faces
Fill my head with empty spaces
Out of the breakdown of the whole
Back to the choices on repeat
Out of a life put on hold
Once again a bulldog baby
Classified as cheap and lazy
Inner pity meat mutation
Pay the price for approbation
Welcome to the new dictators
Power, drugs and imitators
Out of the breakdown of the whole
Back to the choices on repeat
Out of a life put on hold
Mother's dressed in alligator
All good children love to hate her
Out of the breakdown of the whole
Back to the choices on repeat
Out of a life put on hold
Into the fallout of belief

Don't know what to do anymore
I've lost the only love worth fighting for
And I'll drown in my tears, don't they see?
And that would show you, that would make you hurt like me
All the same
I don't want mudslinging games
It's just a shame
To let you walk away
Is there a chance, a fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel, a reason to fight?
Is there a chance you might change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
Don't know if our fate's already sealed
This day's a spinning surface on a wheel
And I'm ill with the thought of your kiss
Coffee-laced, intoxicating on her lips
Shut it out
I've got no claim on you now
Not allowed
To wear your freedom down, no
Is there a chance, a fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel, a reason to fight?
Is there a chance you might change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
And I'll tear myself away
That is what you need
There is nothing left to say
But is there a chance, a fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel, a reason to fight?
Is there a chance you may change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
The day's still ashes and wine
Or are we ashes?

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting
I'm through with doubt
There's nothing left for me to figure out
I've paid a price, and I'll keep paying
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell, and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is
You think I should
I know you said
Can't you just get over it?
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
I made my bed, and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets, and I don't mind saying
It's a sad, sad story
When a mother will teach her daughter
That she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world
Can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter
Saying that I better
Shut up and sing
Or my life will be over?
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell, and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is
You think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell, and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is
You think I should, what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

Seeeeeee the pretty widows
Cooooold as april's skies
Hoooooold their winter roses
Cloooooaked in nursery rhymes
And love is where you find it
And love is where you reach
And love is in the patterns
At her feet
So play her game of tarot
Hold her hair and hand
Fold her dress like petals
Turn the hanging man
And love is where you find it
And love is where you reach
And love is in the patterns
So cold, the pretty widows
Clear as april's skies
Steal her winter roses
Sing her nursery rhymes
(same as verse)

Oh the morning calls
And the morning calls
And the morning calls
And the morning calls

This is a night, i know the time is right
To let you go real slow, woah, oh, oh, I'm so-o
This simple game, it just might be the way
To make you be my man, yeah, but can't you see that
You, Me, could be happy
[Reff.]
So why don't you spin the bottle?
Spin it right around, but aim it towards me now
Yeah, why don't you come and spin the bottle?
Push it one degree, so it will point at me
'Cause I just want to be your supermodel
Eh, be your supermodel, eh, be your supermodel
Eh, I just want to be your supermodel
Eh, be your supermodel, eh, be your supermodel
Eh, eh, so spin th bottle
The night goes on, and you won't play along
But you electrify my heart like I could die
Truth or dare, would make you even care
Why don't you play games? You're makin' me insane
You, Me, could be happy
[Reff.]
So why don't you spin the bottle?
Spin it right around, but aim it towards me now
Yeah, why don't you come and spin the bottle?
Push it one degree, so it will point at me

Eh, be your supermodel, eh, be your supermodel
Eh, I just want to be your supermodel
Eh, be your supermodel, eh, be your supermodel
Eh, eh, so spin th bottle
[Bridge]
Ooh, I see you and a beautiful girl (in the corner of the kitchen)
Noo, but do you want to be with her? (don't know what you're missin')
Spin, the bottle, spin, spin, the bottle 2x
[Reff. 2x]
So why don't you spin the bottle?
Spin it right around, but aim it towards me now
Yeah, why don't you come and spin the bottle?
Push it one degree, so it will point at me
'Cause I just want to be your supermodel
Eh, be your supermodel, eh, be your supermodel
Eh, I just want to be your supermodel

So spin the bottle

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

Through my eyes,
I have seen the world start spinning like a ball.
Stars light up and then fall for you.
So then what's a man like me supposed to do?
If I gave you the moon would you notice,
That I'm right beside you?
Well now a thousand days and thousand nights are not enough.
Cause I can't hold back the way I feel about my love.
Won't let it go, won't let it go.
And if the angels came, I'd fight them back to win your soul.
And when everything was said and done
They'd go back home.
And they oughta know, they oughta know.
That you're mine all mine
In my world,
You're the sun that shines and lights up the evening skies.
Clearing up the horizon, hold on.
Come with me and I will never let you down
Oh, and in this love we'll drown, this I promise you.
Cause they can't hold us down.
Well now a thousand days and thousand nights are not enough
Cause I can't hold back the way I feel about my love
Won't let it go, won't let it go.
And if the angels came, I'd fight them back to win your soul.
And when everything was said and done they'd go back home.
And they oughta know, they oughta know.
That you're mine all mine
I would do anything, just believe it.
Your love means everything ,and I need it.
Your heart won't lie,
Reach out for me...
Well now a thousand days and thousand nights are not enough.
Cause I can't hold back the way I feel about my love.
Won't let it go, won't let it go.
Cause you're mine all mine.
And if the angels came, I'd fight them back to win your soul.
And when everything was said and done they'd go back home.
They oughta know, they oughta know.
That you're mine all mine

Let us put man and woman together
And see wich one is smarter
Some say man, but I say no
The women got the man like a puppet show
It ain't me, it's the people that say
The men are leadin' the women astray
But I say, that the women today
Are smarter than men in every way
Well, that's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
Little boy sat down and cried
An old man passin' asked him why, he said
I can't do what the big boys do
Old man sat down and he cried too
Ain't me, it's the people that say
The men are leadin' the women astray
But I say, that the women today
Are smarter than men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
Well that's right, the women are smarter
Smarter than man in every way

Tu gritas como chicharra en juego de pelota
Las que me guindan por encima de la rodilla
Hay que rica es esa cosquilla mantequilla verte bailar
El hulahu que maravilla

Como to el mundo que ahora quiere cantar reggaeton

I had dreams and crazy schemes
Never felt this way before
I had days when I god raged
Never felt like this before
Endless nights that end in flights
Now I feel love
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never more than now
Paralysed by vicious lies
Never felt this way before
Seen hope die and grown men cry
Never felt like this before
Shed lonely tears and heartfelt fears
Now I feel love
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
A thing of beauty
Lasts forever
Stretches through all time
Every endeavour
No matter how hard
They might try
To build you up
And to bleed you dry
Never lose love. Never
Never lose love. Never
Ever, ever, ever
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now

Somebody got a magic touch
Somebody just can't get enough
Your picture's hanging in my car
I love you for just who you are
And don't you know I want you?, maybe
Baby
Get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And send it to me
Put it in a letter
If that'll make it better
And send it to me, haa
Stick it in a bottle
It's always getting hotter
And send it to me, haa
Nothing gonna stop it
So shoot it like a rocket
And send it to me
I sit behind a desk all day
And dream of you to get away
I got no money in the bank
I don't need much, got you to thank
And don't you know I want you?, maybe
Baby
Oh, get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And send it to me, ah
Put it in a letter
If that'll make it better
And send it to me, haa
Stick it in a bottle
It's always getting hotter
Send it to me, haa
Nothing gonna stop it
So shoot it like a rocket
And send it to me, ahh
Deep in the night, I turn around
And wish you were here with me
I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy
Can't you see
That you're the one that I love?
Get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And send it to me, ooh, oh, oh
Stick it in a bottle
Ain't nothing gonna stop it
So shoot it like a rocket
Baby, send it to me
Ahh, oh
Get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And sent it to me, ah, ho

I am an emigre,
I write to Germany
In foreign words,
A tongue of actuality
Hands in grey gloves
To Germany with love
A war between the wars
A war between the wars
Triumph over by
Gone sorrow
Can in unity be won
Let them all pursue this purpose
Till reality is gone
I am an unexpected spy
From the outside of my eye
Translate it first
Then comprehend
I'm here indeed
But there I stand
I write to Germany,
I write to Germany
To Germany with love,
To Germany with love
This is the turn of colours
All real, some still unseen
There is no more decision
'Cause there's too much in between
Let us build a nightmare nation
Learn and work as never yet
That this cold new generation
Faith in its own fears beget
Here comes the modern rat,
Here comes the terror squad
Ours is the salt of wisdom,
Here we come all dressed in black
From the ruins risen slowly
To the future turned we stand
Flourish in this blessing glory
Flourish German fatherland
I write to Germany,
I write to Germany
All quiet in Germany,
All quiet in Germany

A sweet occasion such as this
Another chance to reminisce
And though together we have grown
It's magical how time has flown.
Remember at the outset
A very long while ago?
You were just a schoolgirl
And I was your big hello.
But time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us.
Remember when you first said
That you would love me always
And how you fascinated
Me in so many ways?
But time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us.
A sweet occasion such as this
Another chance to reminisce
And though together we have grown
It's magical how time has flown.
Remember at the outset
A very long while ago?
You were just a schoolgirl
And I was your big hello.
But time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us.
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
Time, the magician played a few old tricks on us
(Repeat and fade).

Ali dances and the audience applauds
Though he's beaded in sweat he hasn't lost his style
Ali don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free
Me
I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me
I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be
He knows he's such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see
Me
I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign
She's gonna give the go ahead
The inning isn't over yet for me
Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar
I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer.
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me

Ooh, I see you over there
Don't be shy
Come here, um!
You got that thing that I can't deny
So move it over here, oh yeah!
You're giving signs that I recognize
Say what you want, oh yeah
Baby, there's something about you
Show me, that nothing can hold you down
'Cause I, I must confess
I'm feeling you right now
[Chorus]
So, baby, take your chance
And show your confidence
Oh, baby, tell me who you are
You make my body scream
You make me believe
that you're what I'm waiting for
(Don't you be intimidated)
Just be a man
Show me where you stand
Positively, oh yeah
I don't come off shy if you want me back
And if my E-G-O's, no, don't give up to fast
Baby, there's something about you
Show me, that nothing can hold you down
Cause I, I must confess
I'm feeling you right now
[Chorus]
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y
It doesn't matter, boo
As long as you're diggin' me
So much we can be,
Yes, it's true
But first you gotta make the move
For me to see what I want with you
[Chorus: x2]

Baby listen, every time you asked me, I gave you mine
Invitation for one night, but you never thought of me more then twice
Cause there ain't nothing that I could speak
You give and you take then your done with me
I sit in the blues, waiting for you, who I'll never see
There's never good news no not bout you
Cause something don't feel right
There's nothing to choose I cant refuse my turn to try
I guess I loose boy ain't that right
I'd hate to lie, my friend don't deny
Cause what you sees real even though you can't feel
Count back from 5,4,3,2, 1 times
You'd say you'd drop by, but I'm a fool every time
Cause there ain't nothing that I can speak
You give and you take then your done with me
I sit in the blues, waiting for you, who I never see
There's never good news no not bout you
Cause something don't feel right
There's nothing to choose I cant refuse my turn to try
I guess I loose boy ain't that right
The way I feel
And what I know
Cause I can't explain
Whats going down
The way I feel
And what I know
Cause I can't explain why I can't let go

It's all so different now
From just a few weeks ago
When April was about to smile on England
And I had to go
So here I am again
Far from where the blackbird sings
And lanes I love to walk along
Lost in my thoughts
And what of you my love
Though you're so far away
Yet so close to me in all I do and see
And so on my day off
I could have chosen monuments
Historic chateau, palaces
Or finding ways of improving my French
Instead I wandered out alone
Here where woods and fields abound
And in a quiet corner found the resting place
Of English soldiers killed in war
And what of them my love
Who died so far from home
No last farewell kiss
All that remains is this
It makes me so ashamed to feel alone
Whatever would they think of me
For I shall see my love again
It's all so different now
From those few years ago
When April smiled so sweetly still
And they had to go

Pray for a better day
Pray for a better day
Sometimes it feels like nobody cares
And sometimes it feels like I'm the only one that's there
And I cry myself to sleep, and I wake up on my knees
And I pray for a better day
Sometimes it hurts so much, more than I say
I try to keep it inside but I wear it on my face
When it feels like I'm fallin', feels like I'm fallin'
Oh, that's when I pray for a better day
I know it's there on the horizon and it's just about to break
Tomorrow's comin' around, so let today bring you down
All ya have to do is have some faith
And pray for a better day
Pray for a better day
Just when I think that there's nowhere to go
Just when I think that I'm at my lowest low
And it feels like I'm fallin', feels like I'm fallin'
That's when I pray for a better day
I know it's there on the horizon and it's just about to break
Tomorrow's comin' around, so let today bring you down
All ya have to do is have some faith
And pray for a better day
I wanna live a life for love me in there
I wanna make the world a better place
And I wanna find my fairytale, I'm waiting for my ship to sail
I wanna be all I can, show 'em all who I am
And never give up on the way
That's when I pray for a better day
And I know it's there, I know it's there and it's just about to break
Tomorrow's comin' around, so let the today bring you down
All ya have to do is have some, all ya have to do is have some
All ya ought to do is have some faith and pray for a better day
Pray for a better day, pray for a better day
Pray for a better day, pray for a better day
Pray for a better day, pray for a better day

[Marvin]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you
Have you asked why
You seem to fall in love and out again
Do you really ever love
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Why fool yourself
Don't be afraid to help yourself
It's never too late, too late to
Stop, look, yes, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Love, oh, love, love
[Diana]
Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel
This time decide
That you will open up, let it in
There's no shame in sharin' love you feel within
So jump right in
Head over heels and fall right in
It's never too late, too late to
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Stop, look, oh, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Love, love, love
[Both]
Darlin', darlin', stop and look

And listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'
(Ooh, ooh, can't you see that it's not too late)

Oh you slide so good
But just take your time
Drink the blood of fools
I've got to make you mine
Speak in devils tongue
Fake the spoken word
Play with silence now
Well that's what i've heard
I've felt this love i felt this pain
I felt this heartache too
Something strange called love is happening to me
Something strange called love is happening to me
Oh you slide so good
With your bones so fair
You've got the universe
Reclining in your hair
Say my love is good
Say we're not too old
I call you jaguar
If i may be so bold
I've felt this love i felt this pain
I felt this heartache too
I came so close but no one knows
The love i felt for you
Something strange called love is happening to me
Something strange called love is happening to me
They say that we're much too young
To fall in love
Well, what do they know?
They say that our kind of love
Just ain't enough
Well what do they know?
Something strange called love
Oh you slide so good
But just take your time
Drink the blood of fools
I've got to make you mine
Speak in devils tongue
Fake the spoken word
Play with silence now
Well that's what i've heard
I've felt this love i felt this pain
I felt this heartache too
I came so close but no one knows
The love i felt for you
Something strange called love is happening to me
Something strange called love is happening to me (repeat)

Why you want to sweat me now
Why you want to sweat me now
Why you say, why you want to step to me
Trying to get my number want to get with me
But my feeling's waited used to be
Don't want you around me
You said I was not your type
That I was not the kind of girl you like
But now, when you, boy, trying get to me
Remember you're the one that dissed me, oh
[Chorus]
Why you want to sweat me now
You didn't want me when I wanted you
Now I gotta turn you down
You want me now but I don't want you
Why you want to sweat me now
You never came around when I was down
Now I ain't thinking bout you
Now I can do a whole lot better than you
You should of got me when you had the chance
I could of been the best you ever had
But you wouldn't give me the time of day
And now it's too late
Spending too much time speak with me (speak with me)
Blowing up my pager constantly (constantly)
All I see is your number on my caller ID (caller ID)
You need to stop calling me, baby
[Chorus: x3]
Why you know you want to step to me (step to me)
Trying to get my number want to get with me (get with me)
But my feeling's waited used to be (used to be)
(You want me now but I don't want you)
You should of got me when you had the chance (had the chance)
I could of been the best you ever had (ever had)
But you wouldn't give me the time of day
(Now I can do a whole lot better than you)
Yeah, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Why you want to sweat me now
You didn't want me when I wanted you
Now I gotta turn you down
You want me now but I don't want you
Why you want to sweat me now
You never came around when I was down

Hold me close, when you love, love is all, I fill you up
Hold my hand, feel the spark, start a fire, in the dark
When the times when the times are getting rough
When you feel when you feel it's all too much my love
When the weight of the world is on your heart
No, I won't let it tear us both apart my love
I'm fighting for love
'Cause love is the only thing I feel
I'm fighting for us
'Cause you are the only thing that's real
I'm fighting for love (I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
I'm fighting for love (I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
(I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love
Don't give up, don't give in
When the fears are creeping in
No matter what you think you're facing
What we have is too strong
Feeling it in my bones
When the times when the times are getting rough
When you feel when you feel it's all too much my love
When the weight of the world is on your heart
No I won't let it tear us both apart my love
I'm fighting for love
'Cause love is the only thing I feel
I'm fighting for us
'Cause you are the only thing that's real
I'm fighting for love (I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
I'm fighting for love (I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
(I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love
I'm fighting for love
When the weight of the world is on your heart
No, I won't let it tear us both apart my love
I'm fighting for love
I'm fighting for love
For love, for love (I'm fighting, I'm fighting for love)
I'm fighting for love, for love, for love, for love

I wonder if you'll notice
If they lock me up and throw away the key
Gotta be open minded
You've got a lot to learn in the ways of me
You've always got to say something
I'm none of your concern
But you won't listen at all
You know I'd rather say nothing
And just be proud of myself
For tearing down these walls
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I've found a better way
To help keep you from me
I'm better off this way
Whoa
Whoa
I'm better off this way
Whoa
Whoa
You gotta keep this coming, tell me like you know it
But you don't know nothing, your call
We can settle this like gentlemen, or meet me at the back
To end it all inside again
My whole life's been waiting, ever since I can remember
Been anxious awaiting your fall, and God let it be a long while
Can't let go of my life 'till I know you're done
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I've found a better way
To help keep you from me
I'm better off this way
Whoa
Whoa
I'm better off this way
Whoa
Whoa
You want it, you've got it
You've always been such a waste of time
You want it, you've got it
A friend of yours is no friend of mine
You want it, you've got it
When will you act your age
You want it, you've got it
You're the reason things have to change
Whoa
Whoa
You're the reason things have to change
Whoa
Whoa
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away,
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I've found a better way
To help keep you from me
I'm better off this way
Whoa
Whoa
I'm better off this way
Whoa
Whoa
I'm better off this way

Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Can you keep up? Can you compete?
You tip and you toe to the middle of where we meet (where we meet)
And you're all ears and I'm all eyes
You take the lead and I'll take off my disguise (my disguise)
Why you dressing up tonight?
We don't need money to kill the lights.
And why you talking over it?
I don't need words to feel those lips.
And I love how you're up for it.
Anything we want is in our grip
It seems to me that we could be
Dressed up to undress.
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh
You pick me up, I'll take you down
I'll tip and I'll toe to the back of your mind somehow (somehow)
If I confess would you come clean?
You take off the mask and we'll live like royalty (uh oh oh like royalty uh oh oh)
(Whoa)Why you dressing up tonight?
We don't need money to kill the lights.
And why you talking over it?
I don't need words to feel those lips.
And I love how you're up for it.
Anything we want is in our grip
It seems to me that we could be
Dressed up to undress.
How long 'till dawn?
I'm all for taking you on
How long 'till dawn?
I'm all for taking you on
Why you dressing up tonight?
We don't need money to kill the lights.
And why you talking over it?
I don't need words to feel those lips.
And I love how you're up for it.
Anything we want is in our grip
It seems to me that we could be
Dressed up to undress.

I'm looking back through the years
Down this highway
Memories they all lead up to this one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will
When love was too much to bear
I just left it there
But here I stand face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time I never realized
And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around
[Chorus]
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime one heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
I can still hear the song of your laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of your tears
We said goodbye but our hearts did not hear
Now my love there's nothing left to fear
With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you
[Chorus: x2]
But I'm gonna run back, I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me

I feel you all around me
You are everything I cannot see
As the ocean crawls onto the shoreline
So you lap at the edges of me
And now, as I'm walking
I know that you're watching me move
For as much as I need you
I must walk away from you
[Chorus]
You're my life, you're my hope
You're the chain, you're the rope
You're my god, you're my hell
You're the sky, you're my self
You're the reason I'm living
You're all that I have to discover
You're the rain, you're the stars
You're so near, you're so far
You're my friend, you're my foe
You're the miles left to go
You are everything I ever wanted
And you are my lover
So I carry, I carry the flowers
The flowers that are dead in my hands
They will rise up at the very sight of you
They will naturally understand
That today is the day
That we find out once and for all
Now you know I must leave here
You must let me stand or fall
[Chorus]
If I leave will you follow
Can I put my faith in you
[Chorus]
And I love you now
As I loved you then
But this island life
Just had to end
But you will always be
My special friend
I will carry you with me
And we can love again
Now the drizzle
Soaks us to the skin
And the stars hang like a noose
So let's face this together
Now this storm is finally through
[Chorus]

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Cut the superstition
Let it all hang out
Make a clear decision
And we will work it out
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Crosstalk
And we will work it out
Train the jam session
Turn the beatbox loud
Play the chord progression
Come on twist and shout
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Crosstalk
And we will work it out
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
And we will work it out
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Crosstalk
And we will work it out
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Let's have a crosstalk baby
And we will work it out
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Come-on
Come-on
Come-on
Come-on right now, work it out
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you

How can I say, thanks
For the things You have done for me
Things so undeserved
Yet You gave to prove your love for me
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude
All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to thee
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
For the things, He has done
With His blood, He has saved me
With His power, He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things, He has done
Just let me live my life
And let it be pleasing Lord to thee
And should I gain any praise
Let it go to Calvary
With His blood, He has saved me
With His power, He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things, He has done
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
For the things, He has done
With His blood, He has saved me
With His power, He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things, He has done

It was in the way you
Grabbed my waist looked into
My face and told me I was only yours
Already knew that I had
Fell for you giving myself to you
I kinda want a little more see
I don't know what you did but
I like it and how it is I don't know
If it's right, I don't care if it's wrong,
I don't know if its love, but I can't get enough so.
[Chorus]
Yea just what I need tonight [Repeat: x2]
I always want to be alone with you
No matter what we do it's something
That I'm gonna love, even when I am
On the phone with you I pretend I'm
Holding you, I'm fiending for you more and more
See now I know what you did
Just one kiss with your lips,
See I know how I feel
What I'm feeling is real and
I need you to know that you're
Making me go
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Boy you got me just where I been dreaming
Fiending for your love
I have never met no one to take
Me and make feel like you do
[Chorus: x2]
[Bridge]
[Chorus: x2]

You said you'd care for me (no you didn't)
You said you'd do for me (no you didn't)
You said you'd stay with me, yea (no you didn't)
But did you love me? (no you didn't)
And did you hold me? (no you didn't)
Try to console me? (no you didn't)
Meet any of my needs (no you didn't)
But still I stuck by you (yes I did)

Always respected you (yes I did)
Called you my baby-boo (yes I did)
Did I protect you? (yes I did)
When they were after you (yes I did)
Gave my all for you (yes I did)
Turned my back on those for you (yes I did)
Baby (yes I really did)
I thought that we could be (yes I really did)
But you made a fool of me (yes you really did)
And I cannot believe (can't believe I did)
Thought you were mine
Baby (yes I really did)
I thought that we could be (yes I really did)
But you made a fool of me (yes you really did)
And I cannot believe (can't believe I did)

Baby (yes I really did)
I thought that we could be (yes I really did)
But you made a fool of me (yes you really did)
And I cannot believe (can't believe I did)
Thought you were mine
It's not like you cared 'bout me
Seems like I didn't mean a thing
Should have been convinced to leave
But I told you I'm here for you
I should've left you
Then you started playin' me
I didn't know that I would leave
You pushed me too far
Made me give up on love
I don't want you
Baby (yes I really did)
I thought that we could be (yes I really did)
But you made a fool of me (yes you really did)
And I cannot believe (can't believe I did)

Baby (yes I really did)
I thought that we could be (yes I really did)
But you made a fool of me (yes you really did)
And I cannot believe (can't believe I did)
Thought you were mine

Everybody's beautiful
When they're young
And I should know
I've had more than my share of fun
There's all this fascination
With the impossibly thin
With the surface of things
Airbrush Photoshop creation
In all that we are losing
Aren't we just confusing
Youth with beauty
Truth with duty?
There's something on the telly 'bout North Korea
Some war broke out, don't trust the media
I'd like to get a suntan
Some dude was shot in Pakistan
The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
Track's got noddage
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
I was walking through the city
Past a phone shop and a homeless man
Was lying there, looked almost dead
And no one seemed to bother
I ran into a rock 'n' roll band
Two or three of them, maybe four
This one punk just nineteen years old
He gave me his persuasion
He stared at me with his one black eye
Looked down on me like I didn't have a life
And he was right
At least not the kinda life he'd been paradin'
Same sex union
Change the constitution
You can carry a gun
But you better not fall in love with someone
The President who fucked the world
For every future boy and girl
Is golfing in Aruba
With a suntan and scuba
The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
Now everybody dies or fades away
A permutation white and gray
A synergy of light and dust
And skin cells constantly aging
You fell in love with the dream
To fuck forever endlessly
But you don't, that's okay
The rest is better anyway
Botox bungle, CNN
Infomercial count to ten
Change the channel, VCR
Somethin' on my radar
The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it
They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
Don't want to talk about it

You've heard it said a thousand times
But only heard his Broadway lines
So, baby please go
Ain't, ain't part of the show
'Cause when Romeo needs no cue or prompt
The likelier your little heart be stomped
By, by baby don't go
Written, written in to his show
'Cause in the west-end show your life
Played understudy to every part
Got given all the dullest lines
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart
Baby please go (Baby please go)
Baby please go (Baby please go)
The sorry tale we'd all applaud
That only dripped and never poured
But, baby just go
Let him, let him on with his show
The leading snail leaves tell tale lines
The bullshit tower the loudest chimes
But, baby please go
Ain't, ain't part of the show
'Cause in the west-end show your life
Played understudy to every part
Got given all the dullest lines
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart
Baby please go (Baby please go)
Baby please go (Baby please go)
Romantic love lines that we adored (Baby forget them)
They were read by men from idiot board (Baby forget them)
So a message from the wisest guy to broad
Is best like flattery ignored
Baby just let him go
Let him on with the show
Baby just let him go
Let him on with the show

I'm standing in the center of the room
I'm watching boys follow girls perfume
All is as it should be I assume
Except for the distance between me and you
You're standing as a flower on the wall
The room is still but we're about to fall
And all the names that brought us here
Simply fade away
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are is everything I need
(Who you are is everything I need)
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I can't believe that night turned into today
I used the line you were supposed to say
And all the names that brought us here
And now we have to thank
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are is everything I need
(Who you are is everything I need)
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
If you are I will wait I will follow
I'm here to stay
As long as we're promised tomorrow
I promise you today I'll wait
I'll wait
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are is everything I need
(Who you are is everything I need)
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
You are the one

[Verse 1:]

And I'm sick and tired of not bein around you

Yeah, we gotta do something
Yeah, we gotta do something fast
Yeah, we gotta do something
If we want this world to last
Starvation, mountains made of wheat
World balance, this could not be
Some have pennies, others have pounds
Some have diamonds shining in their crowns
Fall apart, it's falling down
Do something, do it now
Do something, do something
Do, do-a-do-a-do something now
Yeah, we gotta do something
Yeah, we gotta do something fast
Yeah, we gotta do something
If we want this world to last
Destruction, bombs ready to drop
Whole world at war, it's got to stop
We gotta love to stay alive
We've got to pray that we all survive
Fall apart, it's falling down
Do something, do it now
Do something, do something
Do, do-a-do-a-do something now
Yeah, we gotta do something
Yeah, we gotta do something fast
Yeah, we gotta do something
If we want this world to last
Sacrificed our future, crucified our past
What are we gonna do, if we're gonna last?
Times are getting harder, harder by the day
Everybody help this world, everybody pray
Something for the rich, something for the poor
Something for the ones that ain't too sure
Something for the heart, something for the soul
I think a real leader better take control
Take these lads back to where they're at
Fulfill the plan of man, get back on the track
Cause we're being watched by the eyes above
Yeah, the eyes of love
Something for the free, something for the sorrow
Something for today so we see tomorrow
So much to be done, to be cleared
The rubble and trouble just seem to double each year
Bigger and bigger, getting worse
Building and building, about to burst
So do something before we're gone
And we're just a rock where a world went wrong

Mine all mine
Wander
Away we go
Over lines
I won't let go, she knows why
She feeds my soul
She feeds my mind
Sun in the morning
My sun, every morning
My star of the evening
My moon, always beaming
She loves to watch me go
She hates to watch me go
I hate to watch her go
I love to watch her go
That's 'cause I always know, she's always coming home
That's 'cause she always knows, I'm always coming home
Sun in the morning
My sun every morning
My star of the evening
My moon always beaming
Sun in the morning
My sun every morning
She feeds me daily soul, she feeds me daily soul
She talks right to my soul
(Chorus)
She feeds me daily soul, she feeds me daily soul
She talks right to my soul

Nobody knows where she came from
The tall-and-tanned-young-and-lovely girl
With a voice as light as air
Nobody knows but no one cares
'Cause everybody loves her
When she signs makes you dream a fairy tale
With a certain smile
She can make you feel so nice
Saying gently "Goodbye sadness"
Still will break your heart
Listen to her once
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be the same
Where is she now the lovely girl
With the softest voices you ever heard
Asking fly me to the moon
I know I'll find her in the sun of Copacabana
Meditating
Her lonely heart is nothing new
With a certain smile
She can make you feel so nice
Saying gently "Goodbye sadness"
Still will break your heart
Listen to her once
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be the same
Never be the same
Listen to her once
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be
Nobody knows where she came from
The tall-and-tanned-young-and-lovely girl
With a voice as light as air
Nobody knows but no one cares
'Cause everybody loves her
When she signs makes you dream a fairy tale

Its been too long
I've been waiting to see you
Endless nights I lie awake thinking what went wrong
I'm afraid that it's too late but I'm still hanging on
Where have you gone, mother
It's been so long since I've seen you
Can someone take me home
I can't take this anymore, mama
Are you thinking of me
Do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that used to make us laugh
Is it worth a lifetime of pain and seperation
How can we forgive when all we want is..
Vindication
I shut you out of my life
Erased you from my mind
Hey
Changed my number
Went to hide
But I still feel you inside
Where have you gone, mother
Do you know how much I love you
Can someone take me home
Can you take me home
Where I belong
Are you thinking of me
Do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that used to make us laugh
Is it worth a lifetime of pain and seperation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Are you thinking of me
And do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that used to make us laugh
Is it worth a lifetime of pain and seperation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Ohhhh woah oooh
Is it worth a life time
Ohhhhhhhh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You have built yourself a fine fortress
And you're the only one who holds the key
You've resolved to pilot your own ship
And you decide what all the rules'll be
No more asking for answers
No more cries for help
You've been hurt for the last time
That's what you tell yourself
[CHORUS:]
I don't know much more than this
But I know someone who does
I was not there in your past
But I know someone who was
I can't heal what lies within
But I know someone who can
I know someone who can
It's a drag living life like this
Believe me, I've been there a thousand times
Spending everyday on the defense
And building walls no one could ever climb
Till somebody showed me my fortress was a cage
He granted me my freedom
Since then I haven't been the same
[CHORUS:]
So you can lock me out
Of your life as you've designed it
But I know there's peace and
I'll be on my knees till the day you find it
Yeahhh...oooh
I can't fully understand
O no
[CHORUS:]
I know someone, I know someone

I was doing fine all by myself
Never really needed someone else
Living like a feather in the wind
Till you came along
Shining like a diamond in the dirt
Never thought that you could make me hurt
In between the words I read a sign
Your place is mine
Lost myself
Inside of you
Rocked me all night through
[chorus]
Out of my bed but you still in my head
I want you to know I won't let you go
Out of my mind cause we're two of a kind
And I need you so I won't let you go
Why did we give all for just one night
I feel you everywhere still out of sight
Am I just a fool to rush for more
Than I bargained for
It's how it goes
You never know
What you've got till it's gone
[chorus]
You opened my eyes
Opened my heart
You came and made everything right
From the start
How will I find my way back to you
Cause I won't let you go
[chorus] x 2

You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You run and you try and you're tryin' to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holdin' you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch
He's a, a good time, cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice
He's a, a good time, cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Run run away, don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember
He's a, a good time, cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep
It's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel the danger
I want to scream
It makes me feel alive
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that I
Have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet
Come on now give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.
Let down your defenses
Use no common sense
If you look you will see
That this world is a beautiful
Accident turbulent succulent
Opulent permanent, no way
I want to taste it
Don't want to waste it away
Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh my self to sleep
It's my lullaby
Is it enough?
Is it enough?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
Is it enough?
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.

your silver glimmer haunts me chasing sundogs in the sky
I'm awake in semuta, and witness to your lie
to sink into the sea to sleep in your darkness
we climb to your temple on the dark side of the moon in our endless disguise
awaken, awakening time to sleep, perchance to dream
in the hollow halls of forever to wait and wait and wait and wait for you
timeless, sunless we've become to fall so far, it was all for nothing
these things I cannot change these things are said and done
your eyes become the chariot of time that tears me across the sky
in a reign of sand, to me, to know to always wonder why...

One is for
Man is god
god is now
end is near pain
is good time is
dear

When I was a child,
You captured my devotion
I spent so many hours
Exploring mixed emotions
All of the ways you spoke to me
All of the things you provoked in me
I'll always love you
Diamond Dave
No one can hold a candle
Nothing else is quite the same
Pretty Dave
I'll always remember
I still carry such a flame
When you left the band
I couldn't understand it
But I've forgiven you
Now that you've recommitted
All of the time you spent away from me
All of the missed opportunity
I'll always love you
Diamond Dave
No one can hold a candle
Nothing else is quite the same
Pretty Dave
I'll always remember
I still carry such a flame
Come on, Dave
Show me what you got
I can take it
I'll always love you
Diamond Dave
No one can hold a candle
Nothing else is quite the same
Pretty Dave
I'll always remember
Diamond Dave
I'll always remember
Pretty Dave
I'll always remember
I still carry such a flame

And the rain will fall, it falls for you.
And the clouds will break into tears,
You should be here standing so near to me.
'Cept I know you should be sad
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.
Though say I know it's only the weather.
'Cause every time it rains you are gone.
And I'm blue.
Then I wake up, then I wake up.
And the sun will shine if just for you.
And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies,
Heaven will pass to me, yeah.
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.
Oh! Why am I still here without you by my side.
So I cry your name and love,
The thought to me is back and how near.
Then I wake up, then I grow up.
And the rain will fall.
It falls for you.
And the clouds will break
It should be near.
And the sun will shine
If just for you
And the love

Ooooh, New York!
Ooooh, New York!
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger for more than an empty fridge
I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
In New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!

We've been over this a thousand times
Spinnin' our wheels instead of saying goodbye
Down by the water where we first kissed
Goin' under graffiti bridge
It's still brighter than a neon sign
I remember watchin' you paint your name next to mine
We couldn't try no harder so it's come down to this
I can't get over graffiti bridge
I can still see your Thunderbird fly
Kissin' me sweet, lettin' me drive
I still hear the whisper of my name on your lips
I can't get over graffiti bridge
Let me hold you here one last time
I'm a heartbeat away from the Arkansas line
I could travel one thousand miles away from this
But will I ever get over graffiti bridge
I can still see your Thunderbird fly
Kissin' me sweet, lettin' me drive
I still hear the whisper of my name on your lips
I can't get over graffiti bridge
I can still see your Thunderbird fly
Kissin' me sweet, lettin' me drive
I still hear the whisper of my name on your lips
I can't get over graffiti bridge
I can't get over graffiti bridge

It's not easy to rise to your applause
Where they've got you by the clause
I'm the fly that build the spider's web
That's what the people on the first floor said
It's just another teat falls on my pillow
A frozen emotion that dries on my face
Sleepless nights just contemplating
Just another tear that leaves no trace
(They call it, call it) Just another tear
My night times not for sleeping
(They call it, call it) Just another tear
I've got to shake this feeling
When you shake hands, cross your fingers
'cause I know that deceipt tends to linger
I scratch your back and you stab mine
Now I know that the winner is judge by time
It's just another tear falls on my pillow
A frozen emotion that dries on my face
Sleepless nights just contemplating
Just another tear that leaves no trace
(They call it, call it) Just another tear
My night times not for sleeping
(They call it, call it) Just another tear
I've got to shake this feeling

Can You tell me how this ends?
I've never been so close to anyone as You
It feels like I'm dreaming, don't wake me up
Today is for the living
And I am on my last breath, my last breath
The air seems so stale, I force my lungs to inhale
I'll be alright as long as You're here by my side
Sell short, when You're so much more
You're so much more than I deserve
You're always there to lend a hand
That's why I'll be right here next to You until the end
Never giving up, You're always there to lift me up
When times get tough, when times get tough
Hopes and dreams
They are shared by You and me
This is where I want to be
You are my family
Sell short, when You're so much more
You're so much more than I deserve
You and I we built this together
Every brick this is ours to make or break
All the blood, the sweat, the tears
Everything's been worth it
And I will protect this until my last dying breath
Don't leave me here alone 'cause I need You
Don't leave me here alone forgotten
Don't leave me here alone 'cause I need You
Don't leave me here alone, don't leave me here alone
I won't leave You here alone, we stand by each other
I won't leave You here alone, we stand by each other

One more body left all alone
She's made another heart her home
Lost between the sea and the sky
An angel learning how to fly
She floats above our bodies asleep in their graves (Save me from her)
Dancing in the moonlight glow (Save me from her)
Our memories hide in vain hoping they can be saved (Save me from her)
But she leaves the ones that won't let her go (I can't have her, save me from her)
I always hear her voice when she calls
Guided by her tears as they fall
She loves everything and nothing at all
Why does this girl live in my dream
More happy than she's ever seemed (I can't have her, save me from her)
Lost between her moon and her sun
What am I supposed to love (I can't have her, save me from her)
She floats above our bodies left cold in their graves (Save me from her)
Wrapped beneath the moonlight glow (Save me from her)
Our memories die in vain knowing they won't be saved (Save me from her)
She forgot the ones of us long ago (Save me from her)
I always hear her voice when she calls
Getting by her tears as they fall
She loves everything and nothing at all
I've pulled apart my heart
I've taken all the love out (I can't save me from her)
I've pulled apart my heart (I've taken all the love out)(I can't save me from her)
I've taken all the love out (I can't save me from her)
I always hear her voice when she calls (Taking all the love out)
Getting by her tears as they fall (Taking all the love out)
She loves everything and nothing at all (Taking all the love out)

Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town
Now in my place
There are so many others
Standin' in the line
How long will they stand between us
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away
Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town (oh those nights)
I will wait
Even if it takes forever
I will wait
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
You never ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime, ooh
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them straight to the heart songs (yeah, I'm blamin' it all)

Whoo-whoo
The definition
Real good
Dark Child
I dropped all that baggage
Let go of that habit
The pain you can have it
Now I?m content with me
I'm lovin' this skin
And I got a good man
Feels like the beginning
Now I?m content with me
It's hard to explain it
Been through it, you name it
The heartache and break and
The shame played that game
But I, couldn't seem to win
I started to think
Something was wrong with me
'Til I was finally introduced to happy
I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you
The definition baby is you
The definition baby you are
I traded that frown in
Bought me a brand new smile
I'm wearing it proudly
'Cause now I'm content with me
No longer uncertain
I'm sure of the verdict
I'm free and love it
And now I'm content with me
It's hard to explain it
Been through it, you name it
The heartache kept breaking
The shamed played that game
But I, couldn't seem to win
I started to think
Something was wrong with me
'Til I was finally introduced to happy
I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you
The definition baby is you
The definition baby you are
'Cause I've been digging for years
Barely see past the tears
'Cause I thought my heart had disappeared
But until you, came into my life
Made me anew
Showed me the truth
I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you
I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you
The definition baby is you
The definition baby is you
The definition baby is you
The definition defined by you

Ok, Akon stay out of trouble now son
Akon, stay out of trouble now son
Let me tell you what hurts the most
I'm a convicted felon and I can't work
No matter where I go I try to get paid
They never give me the job 'cause they are afraid that
I'm a stick em up oh yea stick it
Rob the manager and everybody in it
That's the everyday life of a convict tryin' to make it
Why they sayin to me
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
Me and my niggaz on the block all day clockin' dimes
Lookin' out for police
Cause this the type of shit that we go through
Up in the ghetto jus' to make some cheese
Street life got me gettin' locked up about 5, 6 times a week
And then a made bond, take it from the profit of the weed
All this just to feed my seeds, yeah
I got a stop this livin, I witness one to many killings
I've seen the hardenst niggaz straight propped up
And a pound that's never ever been found so..
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
I'm tryin to stay away from trouble everyday
But its hard when the things you need
Picture lookin at your babies in the face
When they hungry and they need to eat
Tryin not to do wrong
But they won't let me do right
Even though I done changed my life
Criminal records what they judgen me by
That's why...
Momma said don't trouble nobody
Papa said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
Momma said don't trouble nobody
Papa said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody

Is there loving in your eyes all the way?
If I listen to your lies, would you say?
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go
Karma, karma, karma
Karma, karma chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy
If your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet, I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling our love is strong
When you go you're gone forever
You string along
You string along
Karma, karma, karma
Karma, karma chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy
If your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green
Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival
Everyday is like survival
You're my lover not my rival

How to sell a contradiction

Down
Looking back on when I was a child
Not a care in the world
All I've learned and all that I know now
Sometimes we go through pain
Please take us from the rain, yeah
How long must this world continue to be
Seems like no one even cares, yeah
Think about the children and what they need
Help me find a way, yeah, yeah, to take the storm away, yeah
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Before it comes on down, yeah, yeah baby
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Before it comes on down, yeah, yeah baby
I know we've come too far
But we must live in a world full of love
I know, I know, I know we can
I know we can take the storm away
[Incomprehensible]
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Down
You know this world is in definite need for a change
We must ask ourselves, do we want all of our kids
Growing up into a world of hate, a world of prejudice
A world of heartaches, a world of drugs and politics
I don't think so
I think, everybody wants to see the same things happen
We must come together and live together in this world
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Somebody take the storm away
Down
Somebody take the storm away

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that carried me
The sigh that blew me forward
'Cause it was trapped
Trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
And my running feet could fly
Each breath screaming
"We are all too young to die"
Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept between two lungs
It was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept
'Cause it was trapped
Tapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
Now all the days of begging
The days of theft
No more gasping for a breath
The air has filled me head-to-toe
And I can see the ground far below
I have this breath
And I hold it tight
And I keep it in my chest
With all my might
I pray to God this breath will last
As it pushes past my lips
As I gasp
Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me

Baby this life can break your heart
Everyone hurts to some degree
But while this world is fallin' apart
Why don't you come be with me?
Don't you know that night can be so cold
When you're without the one you need?
How much longer do I have to go
Waiting for you? Come be with me
Love can be so simple
When you let it flow
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart
Send it from your soul
Look up at the stars burnin' bright
Listen to the wind whisper sweet
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right
Why don't you come be with me?
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Love can be so simple
When you let it flow
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart
Send it from your soul
Look up at the stars burnin' bright
Listen to the wind whisper sweet
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right
(Know the moment's right)
Why don't you come be with me?
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right
(Why?)
Why don't you come be with me?

Something's not right
I'm overcome by fear
Should've stayed home tonight
We've got to get out of here
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone now
Feel like taking you home
Just wanna be left alone now
I tried not to make waves
I tried to go with the flow
And I've been hiding in caves
The only life I know
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone now
Feel like taking you home
Just wanna be left alone now
And my heart's beating fast
But reaction is slow
Just how long it will last
There's really now to know
So tell me something that matters
Show me someone who cares
Cause when it finally shatters
I'll be climbing the stairs
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone now
Don't wanna pick up the phone now
Just wanna be left alone now
I just wanna go home now
I keep in constant motion
I cant stop what I'm feeling
Like a shark in the ocean
I just got to keep swimming
Darling here comes trouble
Darling here comes the curse
I'm burried under the rubble
And it only gets worse
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone
Don't wanna pick up the phone now
Just wanna be left alone
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like taking you home
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like taking you home

Rattlesnakes into water

Tropical freedom, my heaven explained
And dolphin love, the ocean wave

And party fun in high rise flats
We're animals in jungles
We're animals

I wrote the news today
In a 10 out south the midway rise
And as my money flew
Singing to the pockets you
Could only know your shame
Knowing what the good ones do
And when you see the bruises on my legs from kicking pills, yeah
Then you know how recklessly the pages they are filthy
Fake headlines
Believe me come back
Fake headlines
Believe me come back
Fake headlines
Believe me
Want to be upside down
Maybe thrown from side to side
Once you fall from the sky
Sinning like a sheep at sea
Want to live so out loud
A fashion police break me
And when you see the bruises on my legs from kicking pills, yeah
Then you know how recklessly the pages they are filthy
Fake headlines
Believe me come back
Fake headlines
Believe me come back
Fake headlines
Believe me
You'll cry, you'll cry
You'll cry, you'll cry
I wrote the news today
In a 10 out south the midway rise
And as my money flew
Singing to the pockets you
I wrote the whole front page
With the catchiest words I could find
Fake headlines
Believe me come back
Fake headlines
Believe me come back
Fake headlines
Believe me
Come back

Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Don't go on vacation
I can't live through the separation
Stay in town, girl; stay around, girl; I need
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Last year we were parted
Till September I was downhearted
Skies are so gray when you're away, so baby
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
They say there is no place like home
But I can't face this place called home alone
Pity, have some pity
Spend your summer here in the city
Share my warm nights, share the bright lights; I want you

These rivers run too deep
With schemes of men for days that lay ahead
They sell their souls so cheap
They breed mistrust and fill my heart with dread
When did the boy become a man
And lose his life to learn
So much confusion to this plan
These times are not changing
Show me the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand,
I see a broken land
This boy has learned to fail
In times like these to cry seems so absurd
His own life's crisis pales
In the shadow of this truly dying world
These are the games we played at school
Our hands raised in despair
With no exception to the rule
These times are not changing
Show me the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand,
I see a broken land
Where is the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand,
I see a broken land

Change in the light
Change with the light - turn turn turn around
Change in the light, change in the light
Smile on my face like Dr. Jekil and Mr. Hide
I am changing, I changed with the light
I've been away, running from reality
Who am I, am I an actor in this game?
Change with the light
Turn turn turn around, be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right, feel my vibrations
I'll be changed with the light
Feel my body talk, be mine, never stop
Shake it right in the night
Change in the light, change in the light
Morning has come as the sun catches my face
I Realize that I'm alone with myself
Yesterday all was dark, I was dancing on the floor
In this light I am complete another me
Change with the light
Turn turn turn around, be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right, feel my vibrations
I'll be changed with the light
Feel my body talk, be mine, never stop
Shake it right in the night
Change in the light, change in the light
Rocking to the beat while you're shaking my mind
Change your mind ? 'cause you are are mine
Excited by your beauty, makes me pull up a blind
Hypnotized ? it's up my mind
All the voices, I can't resist my inside
All the choices that the daylight brings
Like a diamond, sparkling and shining
All the hours
Stop, don't stop the music
Change in the light, change in the light
Oho, change with the light
Turn turn turn around, be my baby
Stay for the night, do it right (feel my vibrations)
I'll be changed with the light
Feel my body talk, be my never-stop
Shake it right in the night
Change in the light, change in the light
Change with the light
Turn turn turn around, be my baby
Stay for the night, do it right (feel my vibrations)
I'll be changed with the light
Feel my body talk, be my never-stop
Shake it right in the night
Change in the light, change in the light
Change with the light
Tell me what the daylight brings
Stay for the night
Do it right (change with the light)
Oh change with the light
Feel my body talk, be my never-stop
Shake it right in the night (change with the light)
Change with the light
Tell me what the daylight brings
Stay for the night

Five o'clock in the morning
You ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
Baby I just want you to know
I won't go through it again
Yes, those clouds are closing in
And I will not accept this as a part of my life
I will not live in fear
Of what may be
And the lessons I have learned
I would rather be alone than watch you
Spinning that wheel for me
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
One of these days
You're gonna bring some home to me
Six o'clock in the morning
You ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
It seems that everybody takes their chances
These days
Oh yeah we're standing in the rain
And I will not accept this as part of my life
How can you love me
When you are playing with my life
You say give me time and I'll do better I swear
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair
And I don't want to go back there

Oh God protect me from myself
my fearful, weary soul
it wants to hold on
when all I want is to let go
Oh God protect me from myself
my hard and wandering heart
it speeds toward the wrong
when all I want to do is start
not to do that anymore
I don't want to do that anymore
Change my heart oh God
from the sinful state it's in
to the state you want it in
I want to please you
change my heart oh God
How do I escape from sin
my old self loves to do it
what a terrible predicament
I find myself in
I find myself in sin
I want out of this sin I'm in
Change my heart oh God
from the sinful state it's in
to the state you want it in
I want to please you
change my heart oh God
To please Him is to know Him
To know Him is to see
that obedience to law is not
what keeps us whole and free
The thing that keeps us free
is not a thing indeed
it's the body of a savior,
Jesus Christ the king
I am realizing that the answer lies inside
if in fact I have accepted Jesus in my life
it all comes down to choices and
the issue of control
have I chosen God
or would I rather be the one
controlling the destiny of my soul...
Change my heart oh God
from the sinful state it's in
to the state you want it in
I want to please you
change my heart oh God (repeat to fade)
CHANGE....
do I do what I do or don't do what I want to do?
do I do what I do or don't do what I want to do?

I'm driving out of control
You said something, hurt me real bad
And I'll drive till I feel better
And I'll play my radio, my radio real loud!
And I'll keep driving till I drive outta these clouds
Outta these clouds
Ooh, ooh
I'm flying, just trying to keep the wind behind me
'Coz I said, "I'd never let you get me"
No, you'll never make me blue again
Now I'm finally off the ground
I'll keep flying till I fly outta these clouds
Outta these clouds
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Anyway, I usually don't talk about my private life, certainly not my love life. but there is someone that I've fallen for hook, line and sinker. someone who gives me great joy; doesn't care who
To the world; whether or not I have a good voice; or what my politics are...so, you don't have to speculate, it's my five year old goddaughter, caleigh. and caleigh is here tonight. and she has
Duced me to some of the most incredible movies that I have ever	seen; one of them was "alice in wonderland", you remember that, caleigh? at christmas time? daddy's house, what a brill
Film...the other one was "sleeping beauty"- I mean these are films that I have never seen before - and I remember one day she sang this to me:
Once upon a dream
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
[speaking]
And then I showed caleigh "dumbo" and "pinocchio", two movies that I loved as a child...
When you wish upon a star
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
[speaking]
And then one night, I was reading caleigh "cinderella", and I said, my favorite disney song was from this movie. so I started to sing it, but she stopped me and said: that's not from &
Cinderella", that's from "snow white"! guess what? she was right! so this is for you, caleigh!
Some day my prince will come
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper "i love you"
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
The day when my dreams come true
Who'll, please, make my dreams come true...
[speaking]
I'd like to sing this next song for my son jason, who's old enough to take care of himself, but it's always nice to have someone looking out for you, no matter how old you are...

Love was just a four letter word
Misused to entrust the heart of followers
But it never meant a damn thing to me
Until you came so unexpectedly
Then you curved my whole attitude
Got me feelin' ways that I never thought I could
See really what I'm tryin' to say is I like what I'm feelin'
And I hope you never take it away
[Chorus]
I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
Until you came
Baby I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
And then you came, baby I
I can't believe you walked through my defenses
And made me smooth out my rough ends and
You got me open and I'm hopin' that this ain't no act
'Cause I don't want no parts of that
Matter fact, I really hope that you're true
'Cause I want to invest my time in you
And all my childish dreams with all my conversations
'Cause I know that somethin' special's in the makin' I
[Chorus]
Ooh la la la la la la
Ooh la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Yo! Seriously though, I'm buggin'. I'm, I'm really confused
'Cause I trust you with some things you say, but with other things
I just don't trust you. But my mama said work with it, you know what I mean?
It's like I've been going through all these emotions
And I'm dealin' with stuff I've never dealt with before
It's like you just, hmm, you got me straight trippin' boo.
I don't even know what's wrong with me.
But I hope you understand how I feel, 'cause I really care about you.
So check this out baby.
[Chorus: x2]

(Mariah Carey)
I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found the unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life
(Mariah Carey 98 Degrees)
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you
(98 Degrees)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
I would give you everything (Everything)
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right
'Cause I need you in my life, oh.
(Mariah Carey 98 Degrees)
Thank God I found you
(I'm thanking you)
I was lost without you
(So lost without you)
My every wish and every dream
(Every dream, every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
(Brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you
Oh oh oh oh oh.
See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back (Looking back)
I guess it shows
That we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
(Lost without you, baby)
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful
I found you
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful
I found you
(You, you)
(Mariah Carey)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful I found you

The image on the board
Selling things we can't afford
But we're still buying up in a frenzy
Cause our hearts just yearn for more
Is this sin, all he want?
Is offerings we got?
But soon you'll be overrating eyes
Oh people they can't be good
When what comes next on the market should
But we go on because its understood
But you can only hope, when they say that they want you
Yeah, they'll say that they want you, when they don't
It's like a chandelier
It's like a fountain head
The strings are all there
A chain link fence to convince you
That you're never aware
For things that which you spare
Are at cause they don't care about you
Don't care of what you've done
You're fooled by everyone
But soon you'll go get your daddy's gun
And go out to recollect
From all the guards that you put in debt
It's time you learn that you cannot change
But you forget
But you will always think when they say that they want you,
When they say that they want you, that they don't
You wait but somedays never come
Your prophesying here is done
You're only left with what you beg
In toward you can, begone your way
The others wait till they're okay
They're only left with what they beg, beg, beg
So children kill your teachers
Kill your parents, then kill your preachers
Because you know, that they only will doubt you
When they start to lose their features
It's okay that there gone
Torturing you is all they want
And lesson learned, now lesson taught
You just know what they forgot
Cause they didn't get to find out what you sought

awake and pacing, preoccupied by the clattering trays, stuck in a daze by the fuzzy ceiling radio and rusty hangings that say, "you love us because we love you. p.s. did i mention there is nothing else we can do?" what's there to say? what's there to do with four kids at home and a husband that drops by every couple of days? what's there to think when there's plenty to forget? it's all about numbing the senses, never getting visibly upset. well, maybe you're right. maybe it's like this everywhere but that's no reason not to leave, just go anywhere, just get out of here. you've been here too long. we don't mind these awful uniforms. we smile when they touch us in the back room. we laugh at their sick jokes and curse them under our breaths...act like we don't know they're standing too close, but any close is too close. always saying, "that one was a close call." awake, and pacing. preoccupied. fuzzy feeling inside. blowing smoke and dodging looks and cursing jokes. well i am visibly upset.

i'm wasting my time again, doing stuff i really hate. there goes my life again. i'm slipping into my unhappy state. i want to be better than anything i've been before, and i only want to do stuff that i really want to do. looking at myself clearly i can see what i want to be, but my mind is always wandering off to get drowned occasionally. you think that i have learned but you're wrong, it's getting harder, because the situation is getting worse and i'm not getting any smarter. where is that rome you promised that i could climb? i paid my admission and now you won't let me ride. i'm sick of being disappointed and i'm so sick of being bored. i extended my love to you, instead you used your extension cord.

Round and round and round it goes
And where it stops nobody knows
So crazy, I got this feeling inside
Want you back in my arms again
Come on tell me I want you still by my side
Tell me I am the only one,
You know it and I know it,
This love is stronger than anything
Oh girl you know that it's true,
Forever together with you
Round and round and round it goes
And where it stops nobody knows
Round and round is our love,
let's blame it on the stars above
Hey show me, and please give me your love
I just want to be close to you
Please open, oh come on open your heart
Sometimes you're still such a mystery
I feel it and you feel it
I want you here in my arms again
Oh girl you know that's love
Forever together with you
Heaven knows what we would know
This love is strong, oh please don't go

I need to talk with you again
Why did you go away
All that time together
This feels like yesterday
I never thought I'd see
A single day without you
The things we take for granted
We can sometimes lose
And if I promise not to feel this pain
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again...
'Cause time will pass me by
Maybe I'll never learn to smile
But I know I'll make it through
If you wait for me
And all the tears I cry
No matter how I try
They'll never bring you home to me
Won't you wait for me
In heaven...
Do you remember how it was
When we never seemed to care
Days went by so quickly
'Cause I thought you'd always be there
And it's hard to let you go
Though I know that I must try
I feel like I've been cheated
'Cause we never said goodbye
And if I promise not to feel this pain
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again...
'Cause time will pass me by
Maybe I'll never learn to smile
But I know I'll make it through
If you wait for me (Won't you wait for me)
And all the tears I cry
No matter how I try
They'll never bring you home to me
Won't you wait for me
In heaven...
'Cause I miss you so
And I need to know
Will you wait for me?
'Cause time will pass me by
Maybe I'll never learn to smile
But I know I'll make it through
If you wait for me (Say you'll wait for me)
And all the tears I cry (all the tears I cry)
No matter how I try (how I try)
They'll never bring you home to me
Won't you wait for me
'Cause time will pass me by
Maybe I'll never learn to smile
But I know I'll make it through
If you wait for me...

Deep in the heart I'll seek and find it all.

And he'll help you if he can
He's a coalman

When you want to impress
(Somebody)
And trying to catch
(Somebody)
Remember the old school
And don't forget the old rule
Haste makes waste
And you don't want to worry
Keep this in mind
All things in time
And all once you're there next to you
And you're burning with desire
Look her right into her eyes and tell her
Baby, I need your fire
The lady's got a way of knowing
If you really mean it
One thing more
You've got to make sure that
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love every time)
The right night
With the starlit sky
(It just makes it better when two are together)
Now you want her so bad
She's like no one you've had
That love is the passion
(It's causing that reaction)
Show her tenderness
Be gentle when you do it
You won't regret it
And she won't forget
And all once you're laying in your arms
Just before you start to do it
Remember it's not about what you've got, my friend
But how you use it
The lady's got a feel for what's real, and don't you forget it
One thing more
You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love every time)
The right night
By the ocean side
The right night
And moonlight
(Nothing works better when two are together)
Well
Nothing gone better?
Nothing works better
When the two are together
To the guys worldwide
All things in time
You just got to make sure
That the time is right
Remember guys
The lady knows
Oh yes
You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love every time)
The right
With candle-light
(Nothing works better when two are together)

If we knew a way to go back through time
To the place where love was lost
We could take each other's hand again
And wander back across
But we always seem to end up here
Tryin' not to say goodbye
Baby, we don't have to say the words
Words can sometimes make you cry
Ooh, have a good life baby
Take good care of yourself
Have a good life baby
Be happy with someone else, mmm, mmm, ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, mmm
This time we really will let go
And we won't look back again
But pretend the sun is on a rise
When the day is at an end
So, let's kiss and wish each other love
Over one more sip of wine
Oh, honey, try to give me one last smile
And I'll leave you one of mine
Ooh, hoo-oo, have a good life baby
Take good care of yourself, ah, ha, ha
Have a good life baby
Be happy with somebody else, ah, ha, oh
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hey
Have a good life baby
Take good care of yourself, ahh
Have a good life baby
Hope you'll be happy with somebody else, oh, baby
Have a good life baby
Take good care of yourself, ah, ha, ho
Have a good life baby

Change can come on tiptoe
Love is where it starts
It resides, often hides
Deep within our hearts
And just as
Pebbles make a mountain,
Raindrops make a sea,
One day at a time
Change begins with you and me,
Ordinary miracles
Happen all around,
Just by giving and receiving
Comes belonging and believing,
Every sun that rises
Never rose before,
Each new day leads the way
Through a different door,
And we can all be quiet heroes
Living quiet days,
Walking through the world
Changing it in quiet ways,
Ordinary miracles
Like candles in the dark,
Each and every one of us
Lights a spark,
And the walls can tumble
And the mountains can move,
The winds and the tide can turn,
Yes, ordinary miracles
One for every star,
No lightning bolt or clap or thunder
Only joy and quiet wonder,
Endless possibilities
Right before our eyes,
Oh, see the way a miracle multiplies,
Now hope can spring eternally
Plant it and it grows,
Love is all that's necessary
Lovin', its extraordinary
Why,
Makes ordinary miracles every blessed day.

I once had a love but soon had enough
He was a false contender
He got so thin there must have been deep sorrow gnawing away at him
What will I do?
Will it always be you?
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day
We were so sweet under the Copper Beach
You left a mark you sunk your teeth
Into the back of my neck, oh let's not pretend I needed the lesson that you taught me well
What will I do?
Will it always be you?
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day
What will I do?
Must it always be you?
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day
What will I do?
Must it always be you?
I hope and I pray he'll leave me one day

I can keep canaries and
cook on a camper stove
eat baked beans with a spoon
and smell of ginger beer
I can potter into town
and pick up your prescriptions
and if you're ever sad I'll pull
potatoes from your ears
potatoes from your ears
Someday when I'm older I will
Rock upon a porch with you
Rock upon a porch with you
Remembering the stupid things
we did when we were young
A hard boiled egg and soldiers in a
cafe with an ocean view
sitting silently across from you
sipping strawberry daiquiris and
twiddling our thumbs
till we grow old
I just want to quietly
collect up my cavalry
Curl up into a little ball
and plot my revenge
and it might sound stupid but
the saddest thing about growing up
is that I will never think
I'm spiderman again
I'm spiderman again
Someday when I'm older I will
Rock upon a porch with you
Rock upon a porch with you
Remembering when I was young
and I still had my own teeth
and it's sad to think that
there might still be
dreams of ours that won't come true
they probably never will come true
and we'll regret the things we didn't do
and suck on travel sweets till we grow old
Someday when I'm older I will
Rock upon a porch with you
Rock upon a porch with you
Remembering the price of Polos
and the books we used to read
'cause somehow after everything and
everyone that we've been through
I'm kind of looking forward to
rocking back and forth with you
on the front steps of our sweet retirement home

Paradise is here my love, with you by my side
Now until forever, till the end of time
I wished upon a thousand stars, someday you I'd find
I'm living for you baby, you'll always be mine
I m searching for you baby
Drowning in your love
No I'll never give it up
*oh I climb every mountain
And I cross every sea
To lay in your arms for eternity
Sail every ocean
To capture your heart
To be in your arms
Never to be apart
** I climb every mountain - to be with you
I cross every sea - to be with you
I'm here for you darling
You belong to me
Since you won my heart, my love
I've never been the same
I need your love to feed it
Like a flower needs the rain
Somethings, they will never change
Babe, you know it's true
I live for you only, it's all that I can do
Waiting for you baby
Hungry for your love
No I'll never get enough
*repeat

Just one more word and I'm gonna explode
I'm gonna self combust
I'm gonna blow up the word
With just one more look you're gonna
Cross the line
I mean over the edge
You're on thin black ice
Ooooh, there's a little bit of psycho in me
I confess
Why do you want to pick on me
And not the rest
Does it make you feel big
Does it make you feel clever
So tell me how's the weather
If I just had a littler more time
I'd get some duct tape and silverwear
Oh, if I just had a little more time
I'd show you
The world feels so much better when you
Find you don't fit
There's a ladder in your tights and
Who gives a fuck if whoops, you ain't shiny
And perfect
There's a ladder in my tights and
That's the way, uh huh, I like it
That's the way I feel about it
You'll be trying to hitch a ride with me
When it finally hits you
With just one more push trying to make me
Your clone
Marking me out of ten
For the label on my clothes
Just more more squack
And i'm gonna hit back
I'm gonna burn down your house
In a heated attack
Oooh, there's a little bit of devil in me
I confess
'cause you want to pick on me
And not the rest
If I just had a little more time
I'd get some C4 and dynamite
Oh, if I just had a little more time
I'd show you
The world feels so much better when you
Find you don't fit
There's a ladder in your tights and
Who gives a fuck if whoops, you ain't shiny
And perfect
There's a ladder in my tights and
That's the way, uh huh, I like it
That's the way I feel about it
You'll be trying to hitch a ride with me
When it finally hits you
Hey you will all be coming round
Give it time, let you find yourself
Hey free yourself from the crowd
The world feels so much better when you
Find you don't fit
There's a ladder in your tights and
Who gives a fuck if whoops, you ain't shiny
And perfect
There's a ladder in my tights and
That's the way, uh huh, I like it
That's the way I feel about it
The world feels so much better when you
Find you don't fit
There's a ladder in my tights and
Who gives a fuck if whoops, you ain't shiny
And perfect
There's a ladder in my tights and
That's the way, uh huh, I like it
That's the way I feel about it
You'll be trying to hitch a ride with me
When it finally hits you

Twas the night before christmas and all through the house
not a creature was stirring not even a mouse .
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
in the hope that St Nicholas soon would be there.
He's bringing lots of toys for girls and boys.
But wait until you see that Merry Christmas tree.
So on Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen.
on Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the roof and the top of the wall
here they come and they're saying Merry Christmas to all.

Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
My days are darker than your nights
Since I lost you, babe
Since I lost you, babe
I'm like an ember
Fading out of sight
One more tear, and I know I'll disappear
Bring back the sunshine
That you took away
'Cause I need ya
And I want ya
Just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love
Don't you know
Such a loneliness I've never known
Since I lost you, babe
Since I lost you, babe
I'm like a woman who once knew splendor
Now all her wealth and riches
They are gone
Bring back the sunshine
That you took away
'Cause I need ya
And I want ya
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love
Bring back the sunshine that you took away
Now my future lies in back of me
Since I lost you, babe
Since I lost you, babe
I walk this lonely road to eternity
Just despair and emptiness everywhere
Bring back the sunshine
That you took away
'Cause I need ya
And I want ya
I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
Oh, don't you leave me here
On the dark side of the world
'Cause I need ya
Oh, you know I want ya
Right here on the dark side of the world

I could be a millionaire if I had the money
I could own a mansion, no I don't think I'd like that
But I might write a song that makes you laugh, now that would be funny
And you could tell your friends in England you'd like that
But now I've chosen aeroplanes and boats to come between us
And a line or two on paper wouldn't go amiss
How is Worcestershire? Is it still the same between us?
Do you still use television to send you fast asleep?
Can you last another week? Does the cistern still leak?
Or have you found a man to mend it?
Oh, and by the way, how's your broken heart?
Is that mended too? I miss you
I miss you, I really do.
I've been reading Browning, Keats and William Wordsworth
And they all seem to be saying the same thing for me
Well I like the words they use, and I like the way they use them
You know, Home Thoughts From Abroad is such a beautiful poem
And I know how Robert Browning must have felt
'Cause I'm feeling the same way about you
Wondering what you're doing and if you need some help
Do I still occupy your mind? Am I being so unkind?
Do you find it very lonely, or have you found someone to laugh with?
Oh, and by the way, are you laughing now?
'Cause I'm not, I miss you
I miss you, I really do.
I really do.

Girl with a thick skin made you shine like a new pin
Why smother urges, which belong under dresses?
Do you wish that you could only start again,
Learn to live and be pedestrian?
If all your wishes in the world come true
You'd be as good as new
What can I say that will make them jump to my defence?
I value honesty, I could never pretend
Crest fallen boys are boring
I don't know which way I'm going anymore
I can't be sure
Girl with a thick skin made you shine

So we reach out for the sun, girl
You should be the one, girl
To feel your arms around me
Let my dreams come true
So let's start and have some fun, girl
I'm always on the run, girl
There's no one else beside me
No one else but you

Stay with me 'cause I wanna hold you tight
I look out of my window, I can see the rain
Without you girl everything seems grey
I'll be there, oh baby I'll be there for you
I'll be there, to make all your dreams come true
I wanna do the things in love a man should do
So just take my hand and follow me to wonderland
So we reach out for the sun, girl...
Feel your touch everywhere I'm going to
No one else makes me feel the way you do
Please walk with me until the end of time has come
So just take my hand and follow me to wonderland
So we reach out for the sun, girl...
For so many years I built my world around you
my intentions are not hard to understand
Stay with me, be my friend, 'cause my life is in your hand
No one else - let me shine - make me feel - please be mine
So we reach out for the sun, girl...

The radio's on, it's some jazzy 60s song
She makes him laugh out loud by trying to sing along
But how many years has it been since she was seventeen?
Still, she is flattered that someone so young's so keen
And so she won't refuse, well, what's she got to lose, when she sees him glancing?
This kind of evening could be life enhancing
And so they talk all night until it's almost light and then it's back to his place
Then she sees the uneasy look on his face
A gentle breeze shakes the petals from the trees
She says "Do what you like" because boys aren't hard to please
It's over fast, although he tries to make it last
And then they lie and watch the sky turn overcast
It didn't mean a thing, it's not embarrassing, it was just disappointing
She goes back to work and all her friends are pointing
And in a sixties song she'd go and prove them wrong but this is too confusing
She gets what she wants but still ends up losing
She thought she'd turn a boy into a man
But in real life some things don't go to plan
And so she won't refuse, well, what's she got to lose, when she sees him glancing?
This kind of evening could be life enhancing
And so they talk all night until it's almost light and then it's back to his place
Then she sees the uneasy look on his face
It didn't mean a thing, it's not embarrassing, it was just disappointing
She goes back to work and all her friends are pointing
And in a sixties song she'd go and prove them wrong but this is too confusing
She gets what she wants but still ends up losing

Are you sure that you're up for this?
Do you think that you can handle it?
This is complicated
You might get frustrated
We got the moves that you never seen
Let me show you just what I mean
There's really no chance
That you can do all this
Can't keep up
Can't keep up
No
Try keep up
Try keep up
Yeah
Can't keep up
Can't keep up
No
(oh no, uhum, uhum)
(oh no, show me what you got)
[Chorus]
Try to follow, watch me now
If you think that you know how
Then dance me
Dance me if you can
Get together or fall apart
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me
Dance me if you can
Dance me if you can
Dance me
Dance me if you can
I know you think that you're in control
But watch we move
'Cause this is how we roll
Work it just like this
Let's see you trying to do that
What's the matter?
Can't you figure it out?
'Cause you look confuse, mixed up, no doubt
There's really no chance
That you can do all this
Can't keep up
Can't keep up
No
Try keep up
Try keep up
Yeah
Can't keep up
Can't keep up
No
(oh, oh, c'mon, c'mon)
(yeah, yeah, show me what you got)
[Chorus]
(oh yeah)
Get together or fall apart
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can
Is that the best that you can do?
You gonna have to try much harder
Now is the time to make your move
You now,
Hey, hey, get ready
Hey, hey, let's go
(that's right)
(here we go)
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cchorus]
Get together or fall apart
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me
Dance me if you can
Everybody wants to win (wants to win)
If you think that you can handle it
Then dance me
Dance me if you can
Never easy,
That's the way (that's the way)
If you think you got what it takes
Then dance me
Dance me if you can (dance me if you can)

Keeping the mystery alive

Girl
The secret is
Keeping the mystery alive
It's hurry up and wait
Red tape
Can't escape
Mustn't be late
The school bell is ringing
Soon as we're born we're taught to conform
Don't you get above your upbringing!
But you and me
Girl
We'll keep the magic that we've got
In the future
When we're surrounded by robots
We're gonna be
Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you
Girl
The secret is
Keeping the mystery alive
As you go through this world
Remember this
From nine to five you'll lose your mind
If you don't keep the mystery alive!
Television screen
Someone's telling me
What I should think and how I should be living
Everything's so predictable
Don't you know
Everyone takes more than they are giving.
But you and me
Girl
We'll find a way to ease the pressure
With each other we'll find a way to keep it special
We're gonna be
Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you
Girl
The secret is
But you and me
Girl
We'll keep the magic
Oh
We'll keep the mystery as we go through this world.
We'll find a way to keep it special
We're gonna be -
Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you
Girl
The secret is
But you've got to keep the mystery
To keep the mystery
The secret is
You've got to keep the mystery
To keep the mystery
Remember this
Pays to keep the mystery
From nine to five you'll lose your mind
But you've got to keep the mystery
Keep the mystery
The secret is!

I want to have dinner with Gershwin
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch
I want to talk theory with Curie
Impossible I guess
I want to talk moods with Picasso
On a rendezvous
I want to fly double with Earhart
I want to get next to you
Next to you
So close
Just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry
Can't effect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch
Of your greatness
Is what I need
My circle of fantasy
Would be complete
I want to sing hymns with Mahalia
When the day is through
I want to tell you about it
I want to get next to you
Next to you
So close
Just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry
Can't effect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch
Of your greatness
Is what I need
My circle of fantasy
Would be complete
So close
Just as close as I can get
The rain of your worries
Can't effect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch
Of your greatness
Is what I need
My circle of fantasy
Would be complete
I want to have dinner with Gershwin
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch
I want to talk theory with Curie
Impossible I guess

Not what you are,
But what you've earned
Where Jack-Queen-King
Money's concerned
A friend in need is a friend in debt
That kinda friend king money can forget.
May those that are full get struck dumb
When they tell the hungry of the good times
to come,
More money than sense in their defence
And cheaper jokes at our expense
So if your king is money
Then I feel sorry for you
And if you think that it's funny
Then maybe you do...
Maybe you do King Money
King Money, King Money
The Midas touch doesn't mean
That much until you're crippled with greed,
Using gold as a crutch or half a man
For half a crown for half a kingdom
For half a town
No geldt-in-my-pelt-jack,
No cash in my shack so tell me the things
That you think I lack
Just what kinda price are you willing to pay
For a holiday from the Royal Tourniquet
So if your king is money
Then I feel sorry for you
And if you think that it's funny
Then maybe you do...
Maybe you do King Money
King Money, King Money
Standing by the Xerox machine
I want to duplicate some money
Build a fortune up in black and white
But I'll need a master copy.
You're gonna give your love to me
Shake an apple off the apple tree
When she moves it's poetry
Come to me now, one, two, three
King Ka
King Ka
King King Money
Plan the perfect double murder
Maybe win the pools when I get some money
Honey, I'll be knee high in consumer
durables
Adorables...

Hook
You were fresh like the paint on that Lamborghini
We were getting it poppin
We switch lanes
Revvin through it through it
Now my Lamborghini gone
Yaooo my Lamborghini gone
I remember the days in the Lamborghini you'd stick shift and cock it
I sucked it good did my dance on
But I had to let you go
Yaoo my Lamborghini gone
Riding around solo
Thinking about that dolo
I'm gone
You never meant to hurt my mental sentimental oh?
I know I know I know
Seen you in yo polo
I was on that yolo
Guessing that how it go though
Now I got you in a chokehold
I know
I know, I know, I know
Hook
Riding around solo
Thinking about that dolo
I'm gone
You never meant to hurt my mental sentimental oh?
I know I know I know
Memories is totaled
Lamborghini totaled
Lamborghini totaled
Lamborghini totaled
Speedin, I had to put the brakes on him I'm out
I fell in love with this bitch music and she is just everything you're not

when you feel so far away
though you're close to everything
and the feeling of estrangement
creeping up on spider's legs
even in these days of wonder
even in the age of faith
there are some who goin' under
there are some who got it made
in the middle of the night
when the last of god has died
and the only thing you've got
is the tictoc of the clock
i'm here by your side
in these days full of wonder
so you passed so many years
in a labyrinth of traces
running round and round they led
to no one but yourself..

Funny how I find myself in love with you
If I could buy my reasoning I'd pay to lose
One half won't do
I've asked myself
How much do you commit yourself?
It's my life (Don't you forget)
Funny how I blind myself
I never knew if I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose, I'd tell myself what good you do
Convince myself
It's my life
How much do you commit yourself?
It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It's my life

I like the meaning of your name
Are you aware? Are you the same?
It goes with your eyes, your sentiment
Oh, I like your name, Ezekiel
You're so serene, it makes me mad
You're never down, ain't never sad
You won the pools, I bet you're glad
Your smile is fresh, Ezekiel
Looking philosophical, looking philosophical
Sitting fresh faced over there, with broken sighs
His heart speaks out to answer me
For I am the interpreter of his dreams
Daydreaming makes your tea go cold
Gold earrings make my face look bold
Your compliments are never old
Let's drink a toast, Ezekiel
God will strengthen all your love
So pure, so kind, so noble love
You smell so sweet like lavender buds
You smell so sweet
Looking philosophical, looking philosophical
Sitting fresh faced over there, with broken sighs
His heart speaks out to answer me
For I am the interpreter of his dreams
Can I come inside of your dreams?
Your vivid and exciting dreams
I'm not as timid as I seem
Can I come in, Ezekiel?
My, my, my, Ezekiel, shine your smile, Ezekiel
Chat a while, Ezekiel, you can count on me
My, my, my, Ezekiel, shine your smile, Ezekiel
Chat a while, Ezekiel, you can count on me
Oh, I love the way you smile, come and sit and talk a while
You can say that I love your style, you can count on me
[Incomprehensible], me and you, we can touch the sky
My, my, my, my, my, my, yeah, you can count on me
My, my, my, Ezekiel, shine your smile, Ezekiel
Chat a while, Ezekiel, you can count on me
[Incomprehensible], you and me, we can touch the sky
My, my, my, my, my, my, yeah, can count on me
You can count, you can count on me
You can count, you can count on me

Face a trouble everyday
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow
I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm trying to hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
Can't afford to get in no trouble because I'm on parole
I'm trying to live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
'cause money's way too tight
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
It's weakin' all the muscles in my body like kryptonite
Making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Living and praying for a better day, so!
[Repeat: x2]
Face a trouble everyday
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow
Streets, I ain't no longer on it
Don't need feds all upon it
I done left that life alone
'cause all I did was impress, my homie!
And then my conscience told me
"Careful you tendarone!"
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Gotta get money for food, 'cause if she starves to death
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
And I in that type of mood 'cause I ain't type of dude
It's bad enough, I gotta deal with all this I'm going through
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Living and praying for a better day, so!
[Repeat: x4]
Face a trouble everyday
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle everyday
Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow

and i say
don't go away
you want me
you need me
and i say
don't go away

So I've decided, I'm gonna believe like a child.
Just like them all the while, still carrying my grown up smile.
Cause I can't help this feeling that I get when I,
Look beyond my own two eyes and see my courage come alive.
I love the miracles, oil, fire, gold dust, gemstones and rainbows.
I love the wonders and signs, the glory, the laughter, the joy, the new
Wine!
Faith is being sure of what we hope for, certain of the things unseen.
But to believe,
Just like this little mustard seed,
I can be a big tree.
I want to be the one who walks on water.
To believe is just the least I can do to please my Father.
So I've decided, I can't convince you to believe in,
All the crazy, amazing things I've been seeing.
But if you only, knew just how big His love is for ya,
There's nothing your eyes could show ya,
That could compare to what's in store.

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of
There is no heart so lost it cannot be found
There are no hopeless circumstances
There is no such thing as a godforsaken town
?Cause there are always second chances
Until this life is over
There is no point of no return
?Cause everywhere you turn
His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of
Wherever you may go
You haven't gone too far
Love is always there
Is no night so long it can stop the sun
From taking over come the morning
And there's no road so wrong, it can keep anyone
From finding home around the corner
So even in your darkest hour
Even when it?s more than you can bear
You've always got a prayer
His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of
Like a light in the window
Love calls you in from the dark
Like a tireless suitor
Heaven pursues your heart
His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

Smoke fills the sky
Another day in a new town for me
I look for the light
Under the clouds, beyond the concrete
Up here I hide
Watching the crowds move along
Down those grey streets, I am lost here
In my dreams all alone, I still
Go back, in the memory of my home
Anticipating
One day you'll follow
Oh it's been too long
Since I could see the stars overhead
We used to count them
Shared all our passions, and swore not to tell
I hold them now
And now I know where those stars fell
Days would fly by
When you were mine
Like these dreams I have known, I still
Go back, in the memory of your shores
Left you there waiting
So long ago
Right there, in the memory of my home
Anticipating
One day you'll follow
One day you'll follow
I'll be here waiting for you

Ciara
Uh-huh

Luda!
She ride it like a roller coaster
Soon as I get her to the top, she screams
I put her out like a light, she'll be out for the night
Soon as her head hit the pillows, sweet dreams
Wake her up about 30 minutes later
Calling me the Terminator, let's go again
Red zone, I'ma get her first down
Call me Luda true breeze, I throw it in
Touchdown, he scores, Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that, CiCi better CC me
'Cause them legs just keep on going, so I gotta put her to bed
Let the 808 thump, and the beat go bump
'Cause she ride it like a thoroughbred
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride the beat like a motherfucking freak
Oh baby, baby, baby, do you like it up when I'm up?

Oh baby, baby, baby, he can't stand to look away
When I'm whirling this around

Oh baby, he love it when I twirl this thing around

Ciara
Uh-huh
Ciara
Uh-huh
Catch me in the mall, you know I buy it out
G5 plane, yeah, I fly it out
Lud's in the back look like Lex in them 28's
And, oh you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL Georgia, booties look like this size
23 waist, pretty face, thick thighs

We live for the greater, We live for the good
At least that's what I thought, She understood
So why then the phone call, The torrent of words
That dismissed the past decades, And deemed them absurd?
And what did you think about, Think about with her?
And what did you talk about, Talk about with her?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, To remedy this thing for you
If silence means that much to you, Then I promise to keep silent, too
Bear in mind one final thing, The solitude that it will bring
If silence outlives everything, The residue will never thin
Deny me the first time, Deny me then twice
But not once again, If you value this life
The oldest is broken, The youngest clings on
But the middle tries hard, To still belong
And what did you think about, Think about with her?
And what did you talk about, Talk about with her?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, To remedy this thing for you
If silence means that much to you, Then I promise to keep silent, too
Bear in mind one final thing, The solitude that it will bring
If silence outlives everything, The residue will never thin
Buried alive, And with nobody watching
Severed all ties, With the mother of lies
No circle of friends, No scattering ashes
Just hang up the line, And pray you'll be fine
And what did you think about, Think about with her?
And what did you talk about, Talk about with her?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, To remedy this thing for you
If silence means that much to you, Then I promise to keep silent, too
Bear in mind one final thing, The solitude that it will bring
If silence outlives everything, The residue will never thin

You can't keep a grown woman waiting
Boy you can't be wasting her time
It's only silly girls that will run game
With a woman boy you can't cross the line
It's easy if we both want the same thing
Or even maybe try compromise
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
Let me know 'cause if it's not
Then I'm not the one
I'll be happy on my own
[Chorus:]
I don't know why
But boy you're not easy
The more that I try you take the p
So now I know I got no choice but to leave
And tell you goodbye
Just so you know I don't do chasing
Sweetie you know I don't do lies
Baby I'm too cute for time wasting
You know that I can't read your mind
Gotta let me know what your sayin'
I'm not really the guessing kind
Tell me what you want...
[Chorus :]
Boy you're not easy
Said you should be pleasing me
Don't you know I'll find
Someone else more my kind
I'm too cute for your crap
No way I'm takin' that
Have you got no time for this guy?
Might as well say goodbye oh!
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
Let me know 'cause if it's not then I'm not the one
I'll be happy on my own
[Chorus:]

I would fight not to ever fall too deep
Never sure that love would grow
Now at night as I lay me down to sleep
I could never let you go
And lying here with you I still can't
Believe it's true
Never thought that I would ever find a
Love
That lasts forever
Be the man that's mine
Find the love that never goes away
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me be the man
Used to be scared if I would ever get
This close
I'm not afraid to touch you now
Long before I knew, I'd be making love
To you
I dreamed that maybe I would one day
Lose myself in someone, someday
Be the man that's mine
I always try to find the love that never
Goes away
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me, be the man
Take me where I have never been
I will follow you, you'll never be alone
I will run, run to you
I never thought that I would ever find a
Love
That lasts forever
Be the man that's mine
I always try to find the love that never
Goes away
Tell me we will always be together
Make us stay in love this way forever
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me
Wherever you may be
Always be with me, be the man

I
Buried
Seeded
Lies
And
So
The
Trees
Grew
Emotions
And
Died
And
Now
You
Can't
Breathe
Goodbye
Oh
Oh

Headin' home, but not for long
Another day, another song
I'm a travelin' man, and I'm travelin' on
Good times come and good times go
On the road I never know
Just where I am or where I'll be
As the cars pass by, I'll think of you
When I see the signs I know,
This is Georgia, this is home
Chorus:
141 is a million miles away,
Somewhere down the line, I'll be comin' back to stay
141, my bags are packed again
No matter what I do
I wind up leavin' in the end
Evergreens are rollin' by,
Out my window, clear blue sky,
I'm passin' through and I'm travelin' on
Smell my kitchen, feel my bed
I know it's only in my head
It's the road I chose, and it's been a suite
Everywhere I go, I think of you
As the time passes by, I can see you in my mind
Chorus:
141 is a million miles away,
Somewhere down the line, I'll be comin' back to stay
141, my bags are packed again
No matter what I do
I wind up leavin' in the end
All I know(x3)
Chorus:
141 is a million miles away,
Somewhere down the line, I'll be comin' back to stay
141, my bags are packed again
No matter what I do
I wind up leavin' in the end

It seems forever since you went away
My life is empty and my world is grey
I keep on hoping that the sun will shine
And the pain I feel will fade away with time
I sit and wonder how do you sleep
And if my heart you still keep
I hope in time you can forgive
Tell me, what colour are the skies where you live
If I had wings I'd fly to you
I'd turn your grey skies back to crystal blue
If I had wings, I'd fly to away
Forget the hurt of yesterday, yesterday
I shot the arrow straight through your heart
But I didn't mean for us to part
Thought it was greener on the other side
I learnt my lesson, now its my turn to cry
I watch the sun set deepest red
And still remember the things we said
I hope in time, that you can forgive
Tell me, what colour are the skies where you live
If I had wings I'd fly to you
I'd turn your grey skies back to crystal blue
If I had wings, I'd fly to away
Forget the hurt of yesterday, yesterday
I sit and wonder how do you sleep
And if my heart you still keep
I hope in time you can forgive
Tell me, what colour are the skies where you live
If I had wings I'd fly to you
I'd turn your grey skies back to crystal blue
If I had wings, I'd fly to away
Forget the hurt of yesterday, yesterday

I can't see me in this empty place
Just another lonely face
I can't see me here in outer space
It's so hard to leave a trace
And I try and I try and I try
But it never comes out right
Yes I try and I try and I try
But I never get it right
It's a
Minor Earth major sky
I can't see me in this lonely town
Not a friendly face around
Can you hear me when I speak out loud
Hear my voice above the crowd
And I try and I try and I try
But it never comes out right
Yes I try and I try and I try
But I never get it right
It's a
Minor Earth major sky
But I try and I try and I try
But it never comes out right
Yes I try and I try and I try
But I never get it right
It's a
Minor Earth major sky

One day I'm loaded, next day I'm broke
Spent all my money on whisky and coke
Riding high 'till the rock hit the spoke
It's like window shopping for blinds
Spent all my money on a sunbed tan
Spoke the best that a young girl can
Ended up with a blind drunk man
It's like window shopping for blinds
It's like the heartbreak hotel,
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay
The doors are shut on us,
The neon light fading to grey
They say I drink too much, to me, well that's just profound
How do you know you can't swim, until you have drowned?
Well there's always a drop in the bottle lady
Always a sip of the wine
The glass doesn't seem quite so empty
When window shopping for blinds
It's like gatecrashing a field, that's not true,
They've a harvest they yield
Save your tears for your evening meal,
When you're window shopping for blinds
One day you're sober, next day you're not
One day remembered, the next day forgot
Spent all my money on cocaine and pot
It's like window shopping for blinds
Covered in bruises from head to toe
No-one to speak to, and nowhere to go
A map of nowhere, and nowhere I know
It's like window shopping for blinds
It's like the heartbreak hotel,
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay
The doors are shut on us,
The neon light fading to grey
They say I drink too much, to me, well that's just profound
How do you know you can't swim, until you have drowned?
Well there's always a drop in the bottle lady
Always a sip of the wine
The glass doesn't seem quite so empty
When window shopping for blinds
But what if my husband should come?
Well tell me what have you done?
I've cherished my vodka, I've cherished my rum
Don't mind us, we're just licking our wounds in the sun
It's like writing 'I love you' in snow
You know when you write it the message will go
I want a message my lover will find
Don't mind us, we're just window shopping for blinds

I know why you came
This time that we've borrowed
Imagine us now talking tomorrow
We're not very big
But we're certainly clever
To go on together
Well, what makes sense now?
Disgraceful, will we ever say no?
It's wine that we feel
That drives us together
This hormonal vision
That won't last forever
We're old enough now
And we should know better
To go on together
Well, what makes sense now
Disgraceful, will we ever say no?
This match that I'm burning
Two people still looking for something else

You're telling me the future plans
Where candy-colored pictures
fill your hands
And for a minute I am with you there
And I'm picking out some
pretty dress to wear
But I'll never believe you now
I never believed you then
Shame
I know a place where summers shine
And every fairy tale comes real
before my eyes
And the stories that you always tell
Well, they never held together to well
And I'll never believe you now
I never believed you then
And I'll never believe you now
Could you look at you now
And what it's doing to me
Broken pieces of what we used to be
But I'll never believe you now
I never believed you then
Shame
Could you look at you now
And what it's doing to me
Broken pieces of what we used to be

This is the land of my sunset
This is my Tipsy turvy sky
I hear the soundless singing ocean
And I don't even have to try
Tumble and fumble as it rushes
Rapidly moving in my eyes
Breathe in enough to feel better
Heavenly hurting as I cry
Look at all these, all these reasons and
explanations
For damage that I've done
I'm always trying but needing
All I need to be, be the one
I hold the jewel
That keeps my body warm
It's so smooth, the jewel
That keeps my body, keeps my body warm
Here are all the, all the these reasons
Reasons to believe what's wrong
And I can't be taken in silence
Can't you be the one, be the one I believe
Here it's going, so uncontrolling
But you know I can't be free
This is the land of my sunset
This is my tipsy turvy sky
I hear the soundless singing ocean
And I don't even want to try
Keeps my body warm

You know I'm the kind of guy that does a nine to five
Working real hard 'cause that's the way I live my life
Back home just me & you girl all alone
With no one interrupting, switch off the phone
But I could be that other guy
Who comes home late night after night then tells you lies
So why you tripping out on me girl all the time
When everyday it's only you that's on my mind oh
Every time we take one step forward you take two steps back
Every time it's right you bring left back oh
Girl you really ought to think about it
'cause there's really no doubt about it
You know I've been there for you & that's the truth
(x2)
You know you're the kind of girl that doesn't need to front
Keep it real let me know just what you want
Sometimes you just don't know when to stop
You worry so much over nothing
You risk losing what you've got
Now can't you see there's no other girl
I think you're the most beautiful woman in this world yeah
But you say I don't appreciate ya
And I don't know how to treat ya
We don't do the same things we did no more
[Chorus (x2)]
(Remember)
It wasn't that long ago, you told me that you loved me so
Don't forget all the nights we shared
When you told me girl just how much you cared
(Remember)
You think I'm being led astray, but that's the way players play
I'm not that kind of man, why can't you understand 'cause I
Want you to trust in me, baby girl can't you see
You're only gonna mess things up
You've done enough why can't you stop 'cause
You're gonna lose what's good for you
And that's the last thing you want to do
Won't find another like me oh
[Chorus (x2)]

I love you now
And I never want to change my mind
But love is strange
And the surest things can change
We carry love
More than we can stand to lose
But who can say
The things we feel this day
Are the things we feel in time
Oh how can I be sure
The sun will rise in days to come
And now that I am yours
The world is still for you and i
We carry dreams
Like children in the spring of life
But love is pain
And the purest things can change
Who can say
The things we feel this day
Are the things we feel in time
Oh how can I be sure
The sun will rise in days to come
And now that I am yours
The world is still in cloudless sky
But sad as rain
The surest things can change

I'm just an old youth with a cane made of root
And a dog with a nasal disease
I sit when it's breezing, my dog's always sneezing
I swear it's the voice of Louise
Why do you do when you don't have a clue
And the only thing doing is nothing at all
'Cept wait for night fall when the will of the wind
Has its way in the grass on a summer's day
And the rope ends that hung above layers of dung
Had little on all sides but air
In the buzzing dry wheat that wisp my bare feet
I step on my doggy's despair
Why do you do when you don't have a clue
And the only thing doing is nothing at all
'Cept wait for night fall when the will of the wind
Has its way in the grass on a summer's day

Ooh, yeah
In these moments, moments of our lives
All the world is ours, and this world is so right
You and I sharing this time together, ohh
Sharing the same dream
As time goes by we will find
These are the special times, times we'll remember
These are the precious times
The tender times, we'll hold in our hearts forever
These are the sweetest times, these times together
And through it all one thing will always be true
The special times are the times I share with you
Mmm oh yeah
With each moment, moment passing by
We'll make memories that will last our whole lives
As you and I travel through time together, ooh ooh yeah
Living this sweet dream
And every day we can say
These are the special times, times we'll remember
These are the precious times
The tender times, we'll hold in our hearts forever
These are the sweetest times, these times together
And through it all one thing will always be true, oh ooh yeah
The special times (special times) are the times I share with you
These tender moments, when heaven is so close
These are the moments that I know
These are the special times, times we'll remember
These are the precious times (alright)
The tender times (the tender times)
We'll hold in our hearts forever
(We'll hold in our hearts forever)
These are the sweetest times, these times together
And through it all one thing will always be true
Ohh yeah yeah
The special times (special times) are the times I share
The special times (special times) are the times we share
The special times (special times) are the times I share
With you, ooh yeah yeah (these are the special times)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah (special times)
Ooh, ooh (these are the special times)

Ah, you gonna take me home tonight
Ah, down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round
Hey, I was just a skinny lad, never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat fannys, she was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey
Whoo

But their beauty and their style went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time, Shawn

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that, and something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets, to
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I want to say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone to happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here.
(I lived), I lived
(I loved), I was here
(I did), I did
(I've done), I was here
(I lived), I lived
(I loved), I loved
I was here
(I did), I did
(I've done)
I was here

Candy
She's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder is getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby, you're electric love, electric love
Drowning, you make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me, hold me deep beneath your weight
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder is getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby, you're electric love, electric love
Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby you're electric love, electric love

I took a drink of holy water
It tasted like the pipes were rusty
I've listened to the words of wise men
It sounded like their words were dusty
In the morning would you let me wake
With something to believe in
Because in the morning I only ache
For something to believe in
Soul search to nowhere
Looking for something but grasping at thin air
Soul search to nowhere
Don't know where we're going
We'll know when we get there
Oh yeah
A crystal girl she talked of visions
It sounded like her words were tainted
And for the sky she lit a candle
It seemed as though her views were painted
In the morning would you let me wake
With something to believe in
Because in the morning I only ache
For something to believe in
This perfect love has left me empty
And now I need a soul to fill me
The lizard kings have reached extinction
So now I need a soul to thrill me

I've been giving you all of my time
But I can't get enough of your love
Your invitation is clearly defined
But I can't get enough of your love
You wind me up then let me down
Say that you don't care
I close my eyes walk away
But I know you're still there
Tell me why your face won't fit the frame
It's not a guessing game
If you know then let your feelings show
It's not a guessing game guessing game
I can see that I'm turning you on
But you won't take a chance with my love
So do you think what you're doing is wrong
Won't you take a chance with my love
You wind me up then let me down
Say that you don't care
I close my eyes walk away
But I know you're still there
Tell me why your face won't fit the frame
It's not a guessing game
If you know then let your feelings show
It's not a guessing game guessing game
Tell me why your face won't fit the frame
It's not a guessing game
If you know then let your feelings show
It's not a guessing game guessing game
Tell me why your face won't fit the frame
It's not a guessing game
If you know then let your feelings show
It's not a guessing game

A train to nowhere
I walk around and I tried to hide
Close your eyes, they're telling me good-bye
I drive my car, hear the radio
Playing songs that go round and around in my mind
Why can't you believe that I'm right?
Why can't you realize there are feelings inside
A train to nowhere that we are riding
We're riding over and over again
A train to nowhere
And we are gliding
A way that never may happen again
A train to nowhere
So late at night when I want you home
You said no
I would like to stay alone
What have I done that you turn this way
What has happened to us
Now our love has gone
Why don't you believe in your heart
Why don't you agree to say sorry and hark
A train to nowhere that we are riding
We're riding over and over again
A train to nowhere
And we are gliding
A way that never may happen again
A train to nowhere
Why don't you believe in your heart?
Why don't you agree to say sorry and hark
A train to nowhere that we are riding
We're riding over and over again
A train to nowhere
And we are gliding
A way that never may happen again
A train to nowhere

Quiet nights and quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet nights and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea
How lovely
This is where I want to be
Here with you, so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a bitter tragic joke
Have found with you the meaning of existence
Oh, my love
This is where I want to be
Here with you, so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only a tragic joke
Have found with you the meaning of existence
Oh, my love

Sometimes I walk away
When all I really wanna do
Is love and hold you right
There is just one thing I can say
Nobody loves you this way
It's alright
Can't you see?
The downtown lights
In love we're all the same
We're walking down an empty street
And with nobody, call your name
Empty streets, empty nights
The downtown lights
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's alright
Tonight and every night
Let's go walking down this empty street
Let's walk in the cool evening light
Wrong or right
Be at my side
The downtown lights
It will be alright
It will be alright
The downtown lights
Yeah, yeah
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?
It's alright
It's alright
The downtown lights
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?
Yeah, yeah, the downtown lights
The neon's and the cigarettes
Rented rooms and rented cars
The crowded streets, the empty bars
Chimney tops and trumpets
The golden lights, the loving prayers
The colored shoes, the empty trains
I'm tired of crying on the stairs
The downtown lights
Yeah, yeah

Now you know
Now you know
How it feels
To be down yourself
And you know
What it is
To be sad
No holding back
One last time
One last time
Has come and gone
There's no turning back
Take one good
Look and go
Time will change
The world you know
Real tears
You'll cry
Now you know
Now you know
How it feels
To be alone
And you know
What it is
To be sad
No holding back

Take all the Monet from me,
Nothing matters but the girl,
Take the recognition, take all the fame, even take my name
Nothing but the girl,
Take every stitch of clothing I own
And completely naked I would walk the world
People bloggin' talking crazy
I ain't gonna let it break me
Nothing matters but the girl
I don't need material things to represent myself as long as I know who I am
I don't need nothing else not nothing else
Nothing but the girl
No nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Said nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
I said nothing but me baby
No nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby
Take my seconds, minutes, hours all my precious time' cause
Nothing matters but the girl
Take my skills away the words I say reason and rhyme' cause
Nothing matters but the girl
Excuse me lord don't mean to interrupt
You know that it gets hard living in this world
But thank you in advance
For making me tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
No nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters
I'll tell you nothing matters but the girl
Nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby
I said nothing but me baby
Ain't nothing in this whole wide world
I can't do without nothing matters, but the girl
Special as the air I breathe that's the way I view me
Oh baby baby baby
I said nothing but me baby

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
If you see me walking down the street
Or in the pages of your magazine
Looking just a little differently
Showing off a softer side of me
They saying I'm looking like a lady
They say that love has gone and changed me
But don't be fooled by everything you see
Gotta let the naughty in me free
There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough
Trying to play by the rules is rough
'Cause sooner or later something's gonna erupt us
'Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (still got it)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (oh yeah)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty
Still got that freak in me
Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without being called a million things?
They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know)
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh)
But don't be fooled: the moment I get home (I get home)
I'm letting loose, giving a private show (Don't you know?)
There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to past judgment, but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing; so they better beware
'Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (oh)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (oh yeah)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me (oh yeah)
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty
Still got that freak in me
Don't tell me to behave
'Cause I'll never play that game (no)
Don't tell me what to do
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I ain't never gonna change
And if you're talking about my life
You're only wasting your own time
If I want to wear lingerie outside of my clothes
If I want to be erotic in my own videos
If I want to be provocative, well, that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (in me)
And if you still want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (in me)
And if you still want some more sexy
Still got freak in me
Oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh

all the friends have ever felt so...
Remember the time
When you were here inside my dream

Why did you say goodbye (4x)
Have you ever felt so lonley
Have you ever felt lonley
Remember the time
When you were here inside my dream
I wish you'd be mine
You're understanding what I mean

I know it's late and you're tired
And we'd been talking for hours here
You don't have to tell me
I see that look in your eyes
And I know soon we'll say our goodbyes, oh yeah
I feel it coming
And I hear you take a deep breath
And my hands are starting to sweat
I don't want you to
I don't want you to leave, yeah
Stay here tonight, stay here tonight
'Cause when you're around me, everything's right, don't go
Oh, don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight, stay here tonight
I wanna hold you in my arms, show you what that's like, don't go
I need you, I need you
You grab your coat and I'm dying
But I know that you're still deciding, yeah
'Cause nobody's moving
Time stops and everything's quiet
I'm hanging on for my life and you
You don't even see it
And then you come in closer
And baby it's not over
Till I hear you say, till I hear you say
Goodnight, oh yeah
Stay here tonight, stay here tonight
'Cause when you're around me, everything's right, don't go
Oh, don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight, stay here tonight
I wanna hold you in my arms, show you what that's like, don't go
I need you, I need you
Something about you saves me
Something about you makes me feel like I'm alive
Stay here tonight, stay here tonight
'Cause when you're around me, everything's right, don't go
Don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight, stay here tonight
'Cause when you're around me, everything's right, don't go

I need you, I need you
Stay with me tonight, I need you, stay with me tonight, I need you

I walk across the rooftops
I follow a broken Thread
Of white rags falling slowly down
Flags caught on the fences
I am in love, I am in love with you
I am in love, I am in love with you
I walk across the rooftops
The jangle of Saint Steven's bells
The telephones that ring all night
Incommunicado
I am in love, I am in love with you
I am in love, I am in love with you
The traffic lights are changing
The black and white horizon
I leave the quiet redstone
And walk across the rooftops
I walk across the rooftops
On graduation day
To look for independence, yeah
I am in love, I am in love with you
I am in love, I am in love with you
The lights are always changing
The black and white horizon
I leave the redstone building
And walk across the rooftops, yeah
I walk across the rooftops
I walk across the rooftops
I walk across the rooftops

I think I'm having a heart attack
Another full blown arrest of the cardiac
Got to get it under control
'Cause this whole thing's gonna take me down
Still I'm bound to end up six feet under the ground
Under the ground and I'll take you with me if I go down
'Cause I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
'Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
'Cause I don't want to live another day without your company
I think I'm talking us half to death so let me take a breath
So I can learn a little more about you, I can't hear thing
You're breaking up, you're breaking up, did you fall asleep?
'Cause I won't sleep or wake at all while I lie wondering why
Every time I wake up I just find you sleeping in
What to make of my situation destined to end this way
Hand me the crown, hand me the crown
And I'll take you with me if I go down
'Cause I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
'Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
'Cause I don't want to live another day without your company
Feel the earthquake beneath you
As I slowly disappear in each wake
Feel your bones break
As I pull you in closer and closer
Until I find the right piece of you to take
'Cause I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
'Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
'Cause I don't want to live another day without your company
'Cause I don't want to live a day
I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
A piece of you, a piece of you
'Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
'Cause I don't want to live another day without your company

Monday on the line when you know that now's the time
To leave and be free aware of your destiny
When that moment arrives worlds visions through the mind
And all I see Is what used to be
My life consumed be a memory
I don't ever want to feel pain
want to be ready when you call my name
I don't ever want to feel fear
'Cause every night feels alright when your near
Battle through this wall of nerves when your life it takes a turn
What I have is what I feel well in my mind your lying here
Fear that en holy trail there's a piece of me in all he said
All kinds are fixed up inside my head
The stage freight in my own bed (Ahh ahh)
I don't ever want to feel pain
want to be ready when you call my name
I don't ever want to feel fear
'Cause every night feels alright when you near
Don't wannabe like a voice without words
('Cause I need you here with me)
Don't wannabe unwilling this way (Will I suppress my fears)
And will I be, this war of nerves
I don't ever want to feel pain
want to be ready when you call my name
I don't ever want to feel fear
'Cause every night feels alright when you near
I don't ever want to feel pain
When it's over will I feel the same
I don't ever want to feel fear
This war of nerves that I reserved
For when your here
I don't ever want to feel pain
I'm feeling hurt but I feel no shame
I don't ever want to feel fear
Do I deserve these cruel words we have here

Baby, if I just been a little different lately.
But I want to understand you so much more.
Open the door. anything just tell me.
Open up and say it baby.
Lately, I've been tryin' to keep my distance crazy.
It's not what I expected at first
But now I understand you gotta be a man.
And now it so clear to me so you can keep it real with me.
[Chorus]
You ever wondered what makes a woman cry
You ever wondered why sometimes you make me cry
You ever wondered what makes a woman smile
It's just the little things, you do to make me smile
Maybe, we jumped into this situation to early
But it's something that our bodies can't ignore
Now you want more but I think I'm ready
Just open up and say it baby
Baby,not to mention that you got me feelin' crazy
Every time you walk through my door
My emotions won't let me say no
And now I'm wonderin' if I could??
[Chorus]
You see I'm feelin' you
You know I'm wantin' to
Put all my trust in you
'Cause ain't no guarantee
And I'm so glad you do
I feel the same way too
All we gotta do is keep communicating
[Chorus: x2]

(We got some dancing to do)
I want to go dancing
Too cool for school
When I'm alone I like to break the rules
I want to go faster

And let me blow your mind, so

'cause a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do to the groove
Set it off now
And do your thing
Bring me low
And let the record spin
So give me lovin'
Till I explode
Do the move
Until I lose control
So clap your hands and fingers snap

It's time to let your feelings show
Ready, steady, come on let's go
Love me

White teeth, white teeth
Talent is rugged determination
Skill is a little more dull
Genius buggers straight conversation
Makes sure that it's ass is full
So good looking people don't write no poetry
They're too busy holding their hands
You don't go to beach for depth of thought
If your brain's leaking grains of sand
'Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth
False gums never make plans
Little stones hold big stories underneath
But the big stones go to the dance
The big stones go to the dance
When model puts pen to paper
Paper tends to turn to stone
'Cause original thoughts so hard to squeeze
From a face so easy to clone
So good looking people don't write no poetry
They're too busy holding their hands
You don't go to beach for depth of thought
If your brain's leaking grains of sand
'Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth
False gums never make plans
Little stones hold big stories underneath
But the big stones go to the dance
The big stones go to the dance
Whilst the dedicated cancelled the dates on their latest tour
'Cause genius had played that route ten times before
Hardwork made the excuse of being too hardcore
Yes, don't fire shots from double barrel if you know you're single bore
'Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth
False gums never make plans
Little stones hold big stories underneath
But the big stones go to the dance
The big stones go to the dance
The big stones go to the dance
The big stones go to the dance

I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
There's a wizard who pampers the virgins
He's collecting a potion of blood
There's a blizzard when drowning the valley
Take the virgins away by the flood
On a mountain the wizard perfecting
He's collecting an ancient perfume
Every tear every drop of the essence
Breaking hearts in the temple of doom
I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
There's a castle the height of construction
There's a pipeline directing the stream
In a chamber a lizard extracting
To the goddess a potion of dreams
At the top of the stair hail the axeman
And the angels the peak of the scene
Pass the virgin on Army Of Lovers
Looking grand on a video screen
I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified

I've built some dreams
I've held them close
Celebrated perfect days
I lost the one I loved the most
Now she's 6 feet of earth away
I've cried til I thought I couldn't stop
and I've laughed until it hurt
and I've prayed in an empty parking lot
and my friends were my church
Sometimes the joy can give you wings to fly
Sometimes the pain will cut you so just like a knife
There's fear, there's faith, there's loss, there's grace
I've seen it from both sides
This is what it means to be alive, alive
This is what it means to be alive
I've seen the face of have to have
Of a child without a home
A casualty of circumstance
Written off and all alone
I've cried for the wars that they've been through
and I've walked by their side
I've watched what the power of love can do
and how it changes lives
Sometimes the joy can give you wings to fly
Sometimes the pain will cut you so just like a knife
There's fear, there's faith, there's loss, there's grace
I've seen it from both sides
This is what it means to be alive, alive
This is what it means to be alive
This is what it means, this is what it means,
this is what it means to be alive, alive.
This is what it means, yeah
Sometimes the joy can give you wings to fly
Sometimes the pain will cut you so just like a knife
There's fear, there's faith, there's loss, there's grace
I've seen it from both sides
This is what it means to be alive

Im Britney Spears and Im shaking my ass
I sign a thousand autographs
Please - just get to the point when you talk to me
And if a favor gets involved, just rub my feet
Yea this business is fucked
And I want some fun
I wanna sit at home and watch Dumb and Dumber
Sike- I take that back, Im just trickin you see
Cause when I show my belly everybody copies me
Its kinda cool, nothin but guys
But Im just Britney Spears and I got all this power
But the bottom line is I dont even use it
Right when you become a bitch thats when you lose it
So what if I do? What if I lose it all today?
Ive always got my friends to hold me all the way
Happiness is the key, and love when you fall
Like Lauren Hill said you aint got that - got nothing at all, yall
So how you been?
Its been awhile.
But it feels nice
It really feels nice
Yea

You gotta be rough, you gotta be tough
If you're gonna fall in love these days
You gotta keep an eye open all the time
Or you'll get your heart broke along the way
These days too many lovers
These days not enough love
These days so much danger
To be aware of
Games and lies, lies and games
Made up faces with counterfeit names
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
It's gonna take time if your gonna find
The perfect kind of love that you dream about
It's out there on the street but everyone you meet
Won't always tell the truth so you better watch out
These days too many lovers
These days not enough love
These days so much danger
To be aware of
Games and lies, lies and games
Made up faces with counterfeit names
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Each night, all night
At night it's a brand new dance
That love, your love, true love is bound to change
There's too many lovers
You gotta be rough, you gotta be tough
If you're gonna fall in love these days
You gotta keep an eye open all the time
Or you'll get your heart broke along the way
These days too many lovers
These days not enough love
These days so much danger
To be aware of
Games and lies, lies and games
Made up faces with counterfeit names
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Too many lovers
Not enough love these days
Too many, too many lovers
Too many, too many lovers

Listen to the song he sings
Can't you see his music brings her
Crystal sleep
As her heavy eyelids fall
He's taking her to where the dolls
Rule the world
And in that land of make believe
Is where he'll leave her sleeping
Softly warm
In a crystal lullaby
He's weaving her a paper castle
Where dancing clowns with tassels made of fur
Welcome her into their world
That lives inside the dreams
Of every little girl
She's guarded by a brave tin soldier
Sitting on her shoulder
Taken there
In a crystal lullaby
Sometimes when I listen to
The velvet song that fills the summer afternoon
Something deep within me sighs
And wishes for the peaceful skies
Of long ago
(*) that wrapped my cares
In silver air
And carried them away
Leaving me ...
And a crystal lullaby
Repeat (*)

She left her things behind
Too scared to face her future life
The promises she made
Live well and be a future wife
She couldn't have hold the feelings inside
Something was missing and nothing was right
So she throw it all away
Knew that there's no other way
Don't give up dear Juliette
Don't you let this dark world bring you down
Don't you listen Juliette to the voices all around
All around
All around
She keeps the memories of what they call a perfect life
Remember her boyfriend holds her cold heart and not to cry
She didn't know what went on in her mind
So she just sat there and let her tears dry
Nothing made no sense no more
So she just went out the door
Don't give up dear Juliette
Don't you let this dark world bring you down
Don't you listen Juliette to the voices all around
All around
All around
Don't give up dear Juliette
Don't you let this dark world bring you down
Don't you listen Juliette to the voices all around
All around
All around

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein it in my dreams
I'm lookin down every alley
I'm makin those desperate calls
I'm stayin up all night hopin hitin my head against the wall
What you got boy, is hard to find

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

But look into my own devices, im addicted its a crisis
My friends think ive gone crazy
My judgments gettin kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected if I keep it up like a love sick crack head
What you got boy, is hard to find

Im all strung out my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind!
Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
Your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I dont care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when your with me
But crash and crave you when you leave
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug? your drug?
Huh, your drug?
Huh, your drug?

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Honey honey, how he thrills me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I've heard about him before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, he's a love machine
Oh, he makes me dizzy
Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
The way that you kiss good night
Way that you kiss me goodnight
The way that you hold me tight
Way that you're holding me tight
I feel like I wanna sing
When you do your thing
I want my dad to give me away at
My wedding, but according to
Mum's diary I've got three possible
Dads: sam, bill or harry.
Sophie!

"come to my wedding, you might
Be my dad"?
No, they think mum sent the
Invitations and after reading this
Diary I'm not surprised they all said
Yes!
Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I'm about to see
What you mean to me

No sense, no style
Said I loved you for a little while
When you cried "No"
High speed became go slow
Come back this time
Wishful thinking's gonna make you mine
Push turns to shove
Got no more room for love
I hope you hear me
Can't stand you next to me
Get lost, goodbye
I'll smile before you cry
I love you baby
Oh, please don't hate me
You're feeling a little sad tonight, but you'll be alright
(Yes, you will)
You're feeling a little sad tonight, but you'll be alright
(Yes, you will)
You're feeling a little sad tonight, but you'll be alright

A walk in the park
This happens when something's up
And stays till dark
She's writing cathedral park
But the words are lame
Like her life
And then she says
When you said there's something wrong
It seemed like I'm living without you
Of all the ways to hit me
Of all the things to say
A night at the bar
This happens when she's alone
Three pints too far
He's a bar-fly in lonely town
She sees him off
He's useless
And then he says
When you said there's something wrong
It seemed like I'm living without you
Of all the ways to hit me
Of all the things to say
When you said there's something wrong
It seemed like I'm living without you
Of all the ways to hit me
Of all the things to say

She
Feels like it's all too much
And he
His words can heal her heart
She struggles through the rain to find him at his dorm
He wipes away the tears with words she's been searching for
Fight on
Fight on we will find our way
Fight on
So fight on we will find our way
Saved her
Even when worlds apart
He holds her, her in his open arms
When she's alone she dreams to feel him by her side
Replaying every memory of his voice inside
(Telling her, telling her)
Fight on
Fight on we will find our way
Fight on
So fight on we will find our way
(Fight on) 'Cause he feels her when she feels it
And he knows just what to say (Oh oh oh)
'Cause he gives strength when she needs it
And his heart soaks up the pain
(Fight on) 'Cause he feels her when she feels it
And he knows just what to say (Oh oh oh)
'Cause he gives strength when she needs it
And his heart soaks up the pain
He hears her call
Before she falls
He carries her through every shadow
With just one word
He saves her world
He holds her close before he tells her
Oh, oh, oh
Fight on (Fight on, fight on, fight on)
Fight on we will find our way
Fight on (Fight on, fight on, fight on)
So fight on we will find our way
Fight on ('Cause he feels her when she feels it)
(And he knows just what to say)
Fight on we will find our way ('Cause he gives strength when she needs it)
(And his heart soaks up the pain)
Fight on ('Cause he feels her when she feels it)
(And he knows just what to say)
Fight on we will find our way

So long, I've been looking too hard, I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find, I only know it's a matter of
time
When you love someone, when you love someone
It feels so right, so warm and true, I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong, won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong
This heart of mine has been hurt before, this time I wanna be sure
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive
I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
You're so good, when we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word can say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone, yeah, really love someone
Now I know it's right, from the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be than holding you tenderly
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive
I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
I've been waiting, waiting for you, ooh, I've been waiting
I've been waiting
(I've been waiting for a girl like you, I've been waiting)
Won't you come into my life?

It's been three days of drums and snares,
out on the streets and in my head,
the piccolos are in this band,
with you and me just lying and,
saying "I'll wait",
saying "always"
To have the chance to be so kind,
to someone else who doesn't mind,
is getting rare and often times,
it seems to scare the wandering eye,
looking always,
saying "I'll wait"
This convalesce it is broke,
comforts the test letting go,
you snare the game of our heart,
but you went nacht
So please stow this heart,
it's cold, it's hard,
I wandered off under the news,
the bezzle town on troll abuse,
just thinking of some name I knew,
without a sense of self to use,
saying "I'll wait"
saying "always"
And offer come, as soon as I,
knew who it was who wasn't mine,
you had convinced me of the white,
and so I left myself behind,
saying "I'll wait"
saying "always"

Deep in the night, I remember
There I am reaching for you
Longing to turn to you
That's all I want oh so much
Deep in the night I need you
To touch me
Deep in the night, I wait for daylight
Daytimes I always get through
But when the sun goes down
That's when I feel
I feel oh so alone
Deep in the night I need you
To hold me
Read a book and I think about you
Put it down and I think about you
I make some coffee and I think about you
Wash up the cup and I think about you
Wind the clock and I think about you
Turn on the light and I think about you
When I punch the pillow and I think about you
Deep in the night I feel lonely
Why didn't I try someone new?
It didn't work out I know
But I know but I know
Because I try I try
Deep in the night
I need you beside me
Deep deep in the night

Take just one look around me
Tell me what you see
Your reflection and the brokenhearted memory
I tried so hard to do the best I could
You lied and now we got to get this understood
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me
You should have took advantage
Of every waking moment
But you thought that you had time to waste
And you were so dead wrong
I tried so hard to do the best I could
You lied and now we go to get this understood
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me
I don't want to see your tears
I don't want to hear your voice
Don't you know you made the choice
Boy you did me so wrong
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me
Take just one look around me
Tell me what you see
Your reflection and a brokenhearted memory
Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me

Ah, yeah
(look around...) all their eyes are starin' at you
Look at all the people,
Starin at you and you
They wanna see you do your best,
So you better stand up to the test
Look at all the people
Holdin' their breathe and know what's right
So feed it to them, but make it good
And ease your mind cause you'll be understood
you don't know me like you seem to think you do
If you look right next to you
You'll see you're not alone
But you try and feel,
They'll steal it all from you
Give urself some time to think
Just think things through
Think things through
Look at all the people
Starin at you and you
They wanna see you do you're best
So you better stand up to the test
Look at all the people
They're waitin to see if you've arrived
So lock down and look in their eyes
Know that this is your time
Represent with no disguise
you don't know me like you seem to think you do
If you look right next to you
You'll see you're not alone
But you try and feel,
They'll steal it all from you
Give urself some time to think
Just think things through
Think things through
Look at all the, look at all the, look at all the people
People...
People...
Ah, yeah

This is how I feel, about Christmas
I'm doing one time too
It's the smell of pine, it's the Christmas lights
It's the feeling of God, it's that good ol' Egg Nog
It's the blessed faces, it's them happy babies
It's the family prayer, it's that new V.S. underwear
It's that anxiousness, it's that gratefulness
It's that broke shiz-nit after givin' all them gifts
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
What this Christmas means to me
Spending my time with my family
Knowing it's a season for giving
Running downstairs for mom's cooking
Send the Christmas love to the ones you know
Kissin' your man under the mistletoe
Spreading love to everyone
And thanking God for the birth of his Son
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Snowing and it's cold outside
Wrapping gifts by the fireside
My family is here, Christmas day is here
It's that very special time of the year
Blessed time, a joyous time
It's a giving time, a feeling time
It's a happy time, a laughing time
Sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
It's your gifts you give, it's your relatives
It's your kids in the back room, it's that good home cooked food
It's the Christmas color, it's the stocking stuffer
It's the impatient nights, winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
La-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haughing
La-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haughing
Paradise another good thing in paradise
La-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haughing
La-ha-ha-ha

Speak of the devil and it will appear
Isnt it a crying shame how you became
Isnt it a crying shame how you became the devil in my life
Isnt it a crying shame how you became
Isnt it a crying shame how you became the devil in my life
Welcome in tonight, wide open arms
Freeze dried smile, fixed in a frame of spite
Drop your names just like a bomb campaign
Collaborate while being exploited
And we celebrate by drinking poison
Rolled back my eyes tonight, called you inside
Tied my tongue, tried to stop all your lies
I ask myself, who am i
Am i forever cast in your mold
Devil in my life, treading on thin ice
With your words so wise, always in disguise
Devil in your eyes, ive seen it in your lies
Slowly mesmerized, as i fall you rise
Devil in my life, treading on thin ice
With your words so wise, always in disguise
Devil in your eyes, ive seen it in your lies
Slowly mesmerized, as i fall you rise
Isnt it a crying shame how you became the devil in my life
Isnt it a crying shame how you became the devil in my life
Isnt it a crying shame how you became the devil in my life
Isnt it a crying shame how you became
Youre the architect of my destruction
Tears that fell tonight, your power fed
We slit our wrist, but it was you who bled
Gathered your minions to tell us that we are blessed
No one even dares to suggest we are so powerless
Devil in my life, treading on thin ice
With your words so wise, always in disguise
Devil in your eyes, ive seen it in your lies
Slowly mesmerized, as i fall you rise
Youre the architect of my destruction
The implement of my corruption

I'm leaving today
Living it
Leaving it
To change
Slowly drifting
Into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied and twisted
Are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags
Finally on the move
I'm leaving today
I'm living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change
As I'm driving
I'm captured by the view
So much beauty
The road becomes my muse
The heat is rising
And my hand surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collected
Is the child that lies within
See I'm leaving today
I'm living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change, oh yeah
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm
Living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change
But somehow I miss it
I think I'll really miss it
One day, oh
I turn up the radio
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of
Yester-years and broken dreams I bring
Finally free, ooh
Slowly drifting
Into a peaceful breeze, oh
Oh
Ooh yeah
I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm
Living it, oh yeah
Leaving it to change
To change, oh no
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm
Living it, living it
Leaving it, leaving
To change
Oh oh
I'm leaving today
Oh I'm living it
I'm leaving it to change
Living it, to change
Leaving it
To change
Ooh, oh yeah
Living it, leaving it
Said I'm living it
I'm leaving it
Living it, leaving it
To change
I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I miss it
I think I'll really miss it
One day, yeah

Yearning for more than a blue day
I enter your new life for me
Burning for the true day
I welcome your new life for me
Forgive me, Let live me
Set my spirit free
Losing, it comes in a cold wave
Of guilt and shame all over me
Child has arrived in the darkness
The hollow triumph of a tree
Forgive me, Let live me
Kiss my falling knee
Forgive me, Let live me
Bless my destiny
Forgive me, Let live me
Set my spirit free
Weakness sown, Overgrown
Man is the baby

Hard to believe it, its kinda amazing, but its true, now that I needed
Someone so special, here comes you.
So how am I crazy, to say that I'm dreamin over you
Someone so special, how could you say this all so cruel.
So when your sayin that you need love
I look at you, and kinda smile
It's very ? baby, so maybe this will take awhile.
Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With a little love and squeezin' and hold you close, girl its drivin' me crazy
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love
Now that we started, lets make a relationship at last
Getting to know you, with nothin' to owe you so I ask
Lets keep this real simple, we know that material things won't last
Show me you love me, if anythings different, then I'll pass
So when your sayin' that you need love
I look at you, and kinda smile
It's very ? baby, so maybe this will take awhile
Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With a little love and squeezin' and hold you close, girl its drivin' me crazy
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)

With a little love and squeezin' and hold you close, girl its drivin' me crazy
All over love
All over love
All over love
All over love

I can sit and try to figure out the reasons why
You were always going out alone
I thought that you were meeting with some other guy
All those times you weren't at home
I was wrong but then I didn't understand
What you were trying to say to me
I thought that you were busy making other plans
None of those including me
But then I always had
Too many insecurities
Why didn't I
Just decide to let it be?
I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know
Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know
I remember it so clear when I got the call
It was the hospital on the phone
They told me how you slipped and had a nasty fall
And would I come and take you home
Now that was bad enough but they had more to say
Felt like the words came out so slow
"I'm afraid she lost the baby but she'll be okay"
And I didn't even know
But now I see
I should've been there
From the start
Instead of letting it all fall apart
I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know
Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know
I didn't know
What was wrong.
Girl, I didn't know
I hope you know I never meant to hurt you, girl
But I was way too blind to see
That you were only trying to protect me, girl
I wish you'd had more faith in me
Now I realize that I've let you down
And you have reasons to act that way
I thought that you were cheating when you weren't around
That's why I had to walk away
But girl looking back
In spite of all that we've been through
I'm asking is there still a chance
For me and you?
I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know
Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know
I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know
Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

[guy:] were in the studio tonight with Ashanti
How u feelin'?
[Ashanti:] Feelin' great I'm excited
[guy:] you look good so to all your fans out there all over the world 3rd album what should they get
from this
[Ashanti:] um I really want people to feel me on this one this is definitely my best album I'm just
excited about it the lyrics are just a little bit deeper hooked back up with 7 Aurelius so ites a
beautiful thing to me
[guy:] the albums crazy so explain to everyone the title Concrete Rose
[Ashanti:] Concrete Rose because when you think of Hip Hop you think of something grimy, grungy, kinda
gritty Concrete when you think of RnB you think of something soft sensual kinda like a Rose my music
is considered Hip Hop and RnB so Concrete Rose

Last night I dreamed you were back again Larger than life again, holding me tight again Placing those same kisses on my brow Couldn't get enough of kissin' Sweeter than ever now, Lord, I remember how No you don't, but I do Do you know how much I'm missin'? Even the words that I write, refuse to fly All that I can hear is your song haunting me Distractions I've been using Can't get the melody out of my head you see Days like a slow train trickle by Do you know how much you're losing? I do And I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue No you don't, but I do I never meant to push or shove you Is no word from you at all the best that you can do? Do you know how much I love you? No you don't, but I do

This song right here
Goes out for all my brothers and sisters
All across the land
No matter what you're going through
You gotta keep your head up
'Cause God is with you
God is with you
Troubled world that I see
Every day through my eyes
So beautiful God created the all
Many people many places
Lord have mercy
My Earth was separated
And I'm just trying
To get along
In this world on my on
And I'm just trying
To get along
In this world on my on
I shall never worry
'Cause I'm not alone
God is with me
And I know He won't let me go
So if you are out there and you're lonely
Just remember Faith is and holding on
And I'm just trying
To get along
In this world on my on
(On my on)
And I'm just trying
To get along
(All I can do is trying)
In this world on my on
And it's all a part of life
All the pain and the strive
One day will understand
That there is a master plan
There is a reason for all we're going through
There is a promised land
And He promised it to me and you
And I'm just trying
To get along
(To get along)
In this world on my on
(In this world)
And I'm just trying
To get along
(All i can do is try)
In this world on my on
(In this world on my on)
I'm still trying
And I'm just trying
To get along
(I gotta get along)
In this world on my on
(In this world)
And I'm just trying
To get along
In this world on my on
(On my on)

Shedding tears for affairs
I'm a funny little thing
I can tell you this for nothing
Affairs don't win
Can you handle one more dirty secret one more dirty night
Is it true what they say
Will it make us go blind
You had to drive
Look me in the eye
Whisper don't cry
I'll take an interest in Illustration
It should be a laugh
Your words are with me still
They whisper in the grass
Shedding tears for affairs
I'm a stupid little thing
I can tell you this for nothing
You won't win
You had to drive
(I didn't want to)
Look me in the eye
(I found it hard to)
Whisper don't cry
(I had to whisper don't cry)
So I cried

A pirate walks into the bar
The bartender asks, "What's with the steering wheel in your pants?"
The pirate says "Argh, it's driving me nuts!"
Now I've been riding across the seven seas
Looking for a girl from another fantasy.
I keep a big ship, they call me Captian Kid.
I got the eye patch, tri-hat, rollin like a pirate.
Shiver me tembers, fuck ya til your limber.
Freaky deaky to get leaky.
Like run DMC is trickky, so animated might as well call me Mickey.
Petal to the metal, red eyes like the devil
razor white flag cant reach my level,
like ARGH ARGH, flow sick like stars.
XXX til I hit your mark.
Ahoy ahoy, i put the happy to the joy
Fuck with me and I'll play you like a game boy
Ninja skin ya, throw you in the blender
Chop chop chop! Im a motha fuckin pirate.
Yo ho ho and a bottle rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho and a bottle rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho and a bottle rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho it's a pirates life for me
It's a pirates life for me
Yo ho!
Sorry bitch i wasn's calling your name
We be burning so hot you cant even capture the flame
Street rat? Hood rat? Freak with tats? Spoiled brat?
No way, guess again a motha fuckin pirate
I'm over you like I just got dunked
Battle ship you just got sunk
Boy you think you can handle this?
Is your port hole big enough for my ship?
It's not the motion of the ocean
And size of the thing
Cause we ain't getting no where
With these fuckin water wings
I used to be ballin
Now I'm just straight dunkin
Gold stars for my rhymes
I got all the boys suckin
Jealous bitches be hatin
Cause it's not them we fuckin
That game you claim you play
Is the game that I'm runnin
Yo ho ho
And a bottle of rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho
And a bottle of rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho
And a bottle of rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho
It's a pirate's life for me
It's a pirate's life for me
Now and then we had a hope
That if we lived and were good
God would permit us to be pirates.
Yo Ho Ho
It's a pirates life for me
Yo Ho Ho
It's a pirates life for me
Fire!
Yo ho ho
And a bottle of rum we go
It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho

It's my duty to please that booty
Yo ho ho

It's a pirate's life for me
Yo ho ho
It's a pirates life for me
Yo ho ho
It's a pirates life for me
I'm a pirate niggah!

I've been avoiding the circus
Afraid the trapeze might fall down
You say the fall will not hurt us
Cause the net stands apart from the ground
[Chorus]
So there you go for the rings
Legs entwined and circling
Height of the backside swing
Arms reaching beckoning me
But I am the thin man
All skin and bones
Am I qualified for the job?
Or better off alone
Sleeping in a bed of leaves
Scarecrow where all the birds are thieves
Meanwhile, back at the circus
You seeing as the pendulum flies
Watched by ten thousand eyes

He came from the silent woods
Down in nowhere land
He prayed to his angry gods
With his shaking hands
When he reached the final door
He broke the seal and
Dust darkened the light
As he walked in
Seven sins, seven sins
Strikes of lightning
Don't be sorry
And tonight you'll find
The secrets in your mind
For a while
Seven sins seven sins
It's a never ending story
And the loser sometimes wins
Seven sins, seven sins
He rose to his feet again
Seven sins are go
He followed the hidden plan
How was he to know
When he left the twilight june
He knew it was
The last sin that would burn
Him in the end

A line drawn in the sand and we both know
Im not about to bury myself
Sinking in my footsteps but not coming up for air
Not coming up for air
And a firm foundation of beating hearts
Is blistering enough on the surface
They're closing in and holding out my breath
Hoping to mend the wounds, opened by years of digging out
We fight fire with fire
And youll run back
To your circles of friends
They wont help you now
We drew a line in the sand and this time its now or never
We drew a line in the sand, this time its now or never
We drew a line in the sand and this time its now or never
We drew a line in the sand, this time its now or never
Go ahead and burn your bridges
But only if you can swim
Deep in the sea of disbelief
This time your screams wont be heard
We will fight this battle
Well take you out so quickly
That you and your so called army
Couldn't see us coming
Fight this battle
Well tear you down to the ground
And this time its now or never
We drew a line in the sand
This time its now or never
We cant stop, we can't stop now
We cant stop, we can't stop now
We were born for battle
Without vision we will die
We were born for battle
Against the tide of compromise
We were born for battle
Without vision we will die
There is life in this
This places is close, I take you so far
Wont trust our eyes, to keep us there
This places is close, I take you so far
Wont trust our eyes, to keep us there, keep us there

It feels good!
Uh huh, this is getting tough sitting here waiting for you,
And I think you fought enough cause I know what's wrong,
This is going on, going on from way too long,
I think you wanna know, I just can't wait
Uh huh, I'm trying to find you,
Uh huh, I'm trying to reach you girl!
I don't mean to know, just wanna hold!
Baby we're just playing house,
Just closing it feels good!
Baby we're just playing house,
Just closing it feels good!
That don't make it good for anybody,
Don't wanna be in love just with anybody,
I'm tired being just Mr. Anybody,
So baby come with me, let's just make,
Between us, I need you to see me,
When you go I will always be there
Uh huh, I'm trying to find you,
Uh huh, I'm trying to reach you girl!
I don't mean to know, just wanna hold!
Baby we're just playing house,
Just closing it feels good!

Pull him away
Jealous so with me
Go there for new
For new things there
Singing of a famous street
I want to love, I've all the wrong glory
But is it Heaven or Las Vegas?
But you're much more brighter than the sun is to me
He's a hustler
It's a role he'll never make suit
Hang on to this
Stay and stay and fail and fail
Pull him away
Jealous so with me
Go there for new
For new things there
Singing of a famous street
I want to love, I've all the wrong glory
But is it Heaven or Las Vegas?
But you're much more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
Is like any good playing card
Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me
Carnivals are bluster loud
I'm dizzy so I go under the 'Big Dipper'
Cum fantasy for a carnival
How fitting before a wedding
Singing of a famous street
I want to love, I've all the wrong glory
But is it Heaven or Las Vegas?
But you're much more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
Is like any good playing card
Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me
Maybe then you will swear
This is hardly personal
I suspect I'm singing to a tune
And still find that beats singing to your sone

When the Pope kissed the ground
The sniper fired an angry round
Well it missed him by a whisker
And the gunman could not be found
They found a bullet in the chapel nearby
It was embedded in the altar stone
The statue Virgin upon the altar
Started bleeding on a Sunday
And so the faithful- They came in thousands
From as far as the Phillipines
To pray for healing from the Virgin
And to kiss that bullet clean
Word got around about the Virgin
There were pilgrims- There were tourists
Souvenirs and postcards
Plastic virgins and bullet roseries
And many cripples started walking
And the mute began to speak
And the skeptics kept on talking
It went on like this for weeks
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah song
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah song
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah
Soon they found the statue shattered
A bloodied rifle among the pieces
Found the sniper above the altar
Dead and tangled in the attic
As they rifled through his jacket
A bloodied wallet identified him
And his surname was Emmanuel
His given name was Jesus
So they buried him in the Chapel
With the rifle by his side
And they bought another statue Virgin
With the proceeds from the healing
Now she stands upon the altar
Spring water runs from the bullet hole
Now the Chapel is a shrine
They use the water to make wine
Now when the Pope kisses ground
Bullet proof glass all around
And that's the story of the Virgin
Sniper Jesus and the faithful
That's the story of the Virgin
Sniper Jesus and the faithful
That's the story of the Virgin
Sniper Jesus and the faithful
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah song
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah song
Sing Hallelujah song
Hallelujah
Amen

Can't take no mare of your sweet alibis
Yesterday's lies
Friendless goodbyes
I've had my fill of sweet alibis
When I look in your eyes
It's driving me crazy
Four in the morning and I hear you coming in
I'm trying to pretend
I don't know where you've been
How could the fire suddenly go bad
Or am I losing something I never had
Each night I lay so cold in your arms
Telling myself
You still love me
And every day gets harder to hide
Something has died
And it's driving me crazy
Oh, driving me crazy
Oh, driving me crazy
And though I know I'd be better alone
I just can't let go
Of the best love I've known
And could I live without your sweet alibis
Don't look in my eyes
You're driving me crazy
Oh, driving me crazy
Oh, driving me crazy

What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back, back into time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Donny Hathaway, Leena Horne)
(Miss Aretha, (The Real Thing) James Brown, Billie Holiday)
(Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Louis Armstrong)
(Minnie Riperton, Otis Redding, Etta James)
Back in the day, they used to say
Play that song, get it going, and the band played
And still today, you hear us say
Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ
Though times have change
It's still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go, and feel the flow
If you've got soul, let the world know
We're gonna set the mood (set the mood off right)
Gonna go back to an old school groove (go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah
Here, we say now
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train
[Chorus]
Take it back, take it
Back in the day, back in the day
Oh baby
Back in the day, back in the day
Won't you take me back?
Back in the day, back in the day
I'll do it
Back in the day, back in the day
Oh yeah
Y'all remember back in the day, you dig
Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald
Yeah
Now 'Chain Of Fools' and 'Respect'
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said
'What's Going On,' 'Let's Get It On'
Such classic songs; don't forget them
Though times have changed
They still remain my inspiration everyday
So give it up for the ones
Who came before, opened up that door
We're gonna set the mood
(We're gonna set the mood)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(Go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
(Rewind, another time)
When the originators, innovators were alive
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
(The sound and vibe of yesterday)
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train
[Chorus]
So get up, relive it
Gotta let yourself flow
Give up your praise
Come celebrate
Just get up, get on it
Get yourself on the floor
Don't back away (don't back away)
Come celebrate (gonna celebrate, yeah)
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
(The sound and vibe, all right, yeah)
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train
Takin' back in the day, day
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
Oh baby, I'll do it
Oh baby, oh yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah

Seven tears have flown into the river
Seven tears are runnin' to the sea.
If one day they reach some distant waters
Then you'll know
it's sent with love from me.
Here I stand
head in hand
Lonely like a stranger on the shore.
I can't stand this feeling anymore.
Day by day
this world's all grey
And if dreams were eagles I would fly
But they ain't
and that's the reason why.
Seven tears have flown into the river
. . .
Oh
my darling
oh
my pretty lady
Golden star that leads to paradise.
Like a river's running to the ocean
I'll come back to you fourthousand miles.
Here I stand
head in hand . . .
Seven tears have flown into the river
. . .
Oh
my darling
oh
my pretty lady
. . .
Seven tears have flown into the river
. . .
Oh
my darling
oh
my pretty lady
. . .

I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...
Right back where we started
Falling apart at the seams
You've tagged your name on my heart
And I sat there and let it bleed
Sweetheart so now this is goodbye
[Chorus]
I'm letting you go
You're letting me down
Been caught in your reign and I almost drowned
I'm letting you go, our love's black and blue
How many words does it take
To say I'm through?
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...
You said you knew what romance is
Jaded I fell for your lies
But you're out of second chances
Sadly were fading out tonight
Sweetheart so now this is goodbye
[Chorus]
I have to
Don't want to
I've got to set you free
No more words
It's over
Now I can finally breathe
[Chorus x2]
I'm letting you go (I have to)
You're letting me down (don't want to)
Been caught in your reign and I almost drowned (I've got to set you free)
I'm letting you go, our love's black and blue (no more words)
How many words does it take (It's over)
To say I'm through? (now I can finally breathe)
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you

I listen to the rain, whispering your name
And hurricanes cloud my life again
The memory will fade
And time will turn the page
Our love was made
I dream of yesterday
The fantasy is mine
It's you I long to find
I close my eyes
And dream that you are here tonight
Make believe you're crazy for me
You turn your head to hide
I know the reason why
The moon we ride
Could drown the swelling tide
I call out from the shore
A siren from the sand
This lonely land I am forever more
The fantasy is mine
It's you I long to find
I close my eyes
And dream that you are here tonight
Make believe you're crazy for me
I close my eyes
And dream that you are here tonight
I listen to the rain
Whispering your name
Whispering your name

Yeah
Fa la la la la , Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la, Fa la la la la

I fell into a cinema
Watching pictures in a dream
Shifting the fidget into still
Nine other people took their leave
No humping bones or filigree
Grace and nature mimicry
All but took me to my knees
You jump too soon
And miss all this
Now something beautiful happens
All there is this beautiful meetings
We wait on, we wait on
It moved as slow as slow can be
Half eaten words of earth and sea
I didn't feel it touching me
You jump too soon
And miss all this
Now something beautiful happens
All there is this beautiful meetings
We wait on, we wait on
I fell into a cinema
I didn't know where else to be
Sitting out a trip or three
I thought I want frippery
Fat girl five seats down and me
Concave and blinking at the scene
Rolling credits on the screen
You jump too soon
And miss all this
Now something beautiful happens
All there is this beautiful meetings
We wait on, we wait on

If you've got something to say
Why don't you say it
If you've got something to give
Why don't you give it to me
Day after day I have to say it
We're moving further from heaven
And closer to the deep blue sea
Cause I have no secrets from you
And I have nothing left to hide
And I'm open to all of your questions
Why can't you reach inside
Like I have
Like I have for you
And all these games that you play
Don't tell me how a man should be
Some would say if you knew
You wouldn't be here with me
I Love you
I still love you
But I guess it's time to let you be
Cause I have no secrets from you
And I have nothing left to hide
and I'm so tired of all these questions
Cause maybe you just changed your mind
Like I have
Like I have
Like I have
Like I have
When I was at your doorstep
You told me to look around
Said come in
You and your heart sit down
But you better watch your step
Cause your not far from the ground
And one fine day this all falls down
Like I have
Like I have
If you got something to say
Why don't you say it
If you've got something to give
Why don't you give it to me
Day after day I have to say it
If we've got something to save
Why don't we save it

How can you move when they're weighing you down
What can you do when you're tied to the ground, yeah
You carry your burdens, heavy like gravity
Just let them go now, there's freedom in release
You can't run when you're holding suitcases
It's a new day throw away your mistakes and open up your heart
Lay down your guard, you don't have to be afraid
Just breathe, your load can be lifted
There's a better way when you know you're forgiven
Open up your heart, lay down your guard
You don't have to be afraid
Can you imagine what it's like to be free
Well, send those bags packing, they're not what you need
Abandon your troubles on the side of the street
Just let them go now, believe me
You can't run when you're holding suitcases
It's a new day throw away your mistakes and open up your heart
Lay down your guard, you don't have to be afraid
Just breathe, your load can be lifted
There's a better way when you know you're forgiven
Open up your heart, lay down your guard
You don't have to be afraid
There's nothing hold you back now, just run
You can't run when you're holding suitcases
It's a new day throw away your mistakes and open up your heart
Lay down your guard, you don't have to be afraid
Just breathe, your load can be lifted
There's a better way when you know you're forgiven
Open up your heart, lay down your guard
You don't have to be
You don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Tricky moon, you haunt my heart
I dream of her and there you are
Half love half lies I was her fool
Under the spell of a tricky moon
One night or one kiss I held her close
It felt so right how could I know
Come morning light, she'd be so cruel
She just slipped out of my sight
Did she learn her tricks from you
[Chorus]
I'd give my all to be with her
I gave my heart, she gave her word
But tonight I face the cold hard facts
That I never will erase 'cause you keep coming back
[Chorus]
Under the spell of a tricky moon

Met an old man, Miller his name
Met him on a dusty road
Got off the bus, Heard him singing
Sittin' in a rocking chair
I said where you been?
Tell me your story
I'm ready now, let's begin
He said
[Chorus]
Oh! oh!
Red Indian girl (red Indian girl)
I've found her heart in so many places
Oh! oh!
Red Indian girl (red Indian girl)
I've seen her smile in so many faces
Oh! oh!
(Her smile is the sun)
(And her eyes are like the moon)
He talked and he talked
For so many hours
I listened to his every word
I sat at his feet and looked in his eyes
And now I know what he meant
I tell you what he meant
He said
[Chorus]
(Come on, come on, come on)
(Oh! oh!)
(Her smile is the sun)
(And her eyes are like the moon)
Old man no longer alone
I'll be your red Indian friend
You'll say
[Chorus: x2]
(Her smile is the sun)
(And her eyes are like the moon)

You're the ruler of your destiny
Can I talk to you about a thing or two?
It's not right that you're feeling blue
Never ever let them get to you
You know I've been right there where you are now
It's all right, I'll show you how
You can be, you can be what you wanna be
You're the ruler of your destiny
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
It won't take too long before you know
There's no other way to go
Then straight to the top of the world
Straight to the top of the world
It's there, in your heart
Don't let anyone tear it apart
You can be, you can be what you wanna be
You're the ruler of your destiny
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
Don't let go, there's someone here
To see you through
There's someone here for you
Someone here for you
You're the ruler of your destiny
You can be what you want to be
It's your life and you got the key
Wake up, wake up, wake up now
Gotta learn that you're in control
Of your body, of your soul
What matters at the end of the day
Is if you make it shine
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine
Why don't you let your soul shine?

Naturally, I worried if I do it alone
Who really cares, causes it's your life

So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
It's over
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
When it's over
And we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all around was turning
And we were cruising for the ride
Got to give a little of the love inside
Not to take it all
And watch me fall
I got me loving you
I had you loving me
And we both played along
Love is easy on the young
Life was together
As the world fades away
Into yesterday
I'm losing you forever
I'm just an empty shell
With nothing for tomorrow
I'm here to face the sorrow
The dream we sailed was far & wide
Got to give a little of the love inside
Not to take apart
This breaking heart
I got me loving you
I had you loving me
So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
It's over
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
When it's over
And we can't take it home
The fire that is burning
When all around is turning
The dream we sailed was far & wide
Got to give a little of the love inside
The love inside
The love inside

BLAME IT ON THE SUMMER
Basia?It?s That Girl Again (2009)
Day by day and night by night
Love?s a dream heaven sent
I am yours and you?re mine
What more can I pray for
But every minute, every hour
I play a waiting game
?Cause once again the spring is all around
I know so well your smiling face
That greets me every day
You stand by me I stand by you
All?s good and well, so
Day by day and night by night
I play a waiting game
?Cause my world will soon be turning upside down
In summer
CHORUS:
Blame it on the summer
I can?t help how summer makes me feel
Blame it on the summer
I don?t care if what I feel is real
Blame it on the summer
I can?t explain what summer makes me do
I want to break away and fly away
?Cause summer makes me run away from you
Years go by a playful time
Resign come what may
You keep on loving me
And I still keep on wishing
?Cause every hour here in silence
The game remains the same
And the summer makes my world turn upside down
Oh, summer
CHORUS
I want to break away and fly away
Summer makes me run away
Summer makes me run away
Summer makes me run away
Summer makes me run away from you
CHORUS
Blame it on the summer
Blame it on the summer
Blame it on the summer
Blame it on the summer
Blame it on the summer
I want to break away and fly away
Blame it on the summer
?Cause summer makes me run away from you
Blame it on the summer
From you

Last night I dreamt of your hands in mine
Your touch made me feel alive
You told me that I was your favorite mistake
Our destinies intertwined
And it felt so real
Seeing our love, it's just begun
And it makes me feel so warm
I could melt inside
Hold me close
Hold me deep inside your heart now
Dream with me
Close your eyes and you will see
Our rapture of love, our rapture of love
I woke up this morning, your hand in mine
And gazed into your eyes
You smiled so coy and you moved in slowly
A kiss to stop all time
And this feels so real
Seeing our love, it's just begun
And it makes me feel
So warm I could melt inside
Hold me close
Hold me deep inside your heart now
Dream with me
Close your eyes and you will see
Our rapture of love
Is this real? Have I found my love?
This is real, I found my love
Is this real? Have I found my love?
This is real, I found my love
Hold me close
Hold me deep inside your heart now
Dream with me
Close your eyes and you will see
Hold me close
Hold me deep inside your heart now
Dream with me
Close your eyes and you will see
Our rapture of love
Our rapture of love, our rapture of love
Our rapture of love, our rapture of love

Maybe I'll treat you better
Maybe I'll be your friend
Maybe I'll wear your sweater
Maybe I'll find some time
To go shopping
And buy you nicer clothes
'Cause the ones you've got have got to go
I'll cook your dinner
Put some meat on those bones
That's the least I could do
I'd be so good for you
I build you up
I'll be the best
You'd have it all
If we were, if we were
You'd never be
So damn depressed
If we were, if we were
I build you up
You'd never rest
If we were, if we were
We'd be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever
Maybe I'll do your laundry
Maybe I'll scratch your back
Tell you I adore you
Make you feel like a man
And all of that
Now wouldn't that be nice?
And you've got a life, wouldn't think less
I'll drive you crazy for the rest of your life
That's the least I could do
I'd be so good to you
I build you up
I'll be the best
You'd have it all
If we were, if we were
You'd never be
So damn depressed
If we were, if we were
I build you up
You'd never rest
If we were, if we were
We'd be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever
You don't realize what your missing
All the huggin', all the kissin'
Shut up and listen to me
But we're not
I forgot
I build you up
I'll be the best
You'd have it all
If we were, if we were
You'd never be
So damn depressed
If we were, if we were
I build you up
You'd never rest
If we were, if we were
We'd be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever
You don't realize what your missing
All the huggin', all the kissin'
Shut up and listen to me
But we're not
I forgot

Tell me what's on ya mind and, baby, don't try to lie
'Cause your lips say this but your heart does that, oh oh
Well, maybe we're just wasting time, trying to pretend we're doing fine
But it's just a game trying to mend that patch
Something that fell apart sometime ago
Both of us know the truth, yeah, still a part of me can't let go
But I'm tired of been played, so where do we go from here
I expected more from you, baby, then what you could return
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie
For the things that I've heard, I guess they say we're absurd
Until you showed yourself to be someone else, oh yeah
Don't wanna leave feeling like I do
'Cause I've got things that I must say to you, baby
The trust I had for you before, just left and it ain't coming back no more
By the way that was me driving next to your car
I saw her kissing you and you kissed her right back
And there's much more than friendship when you're kissing like that
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie
You lied about meeting me every minute of the day
You lied when you were kissing me and more than that I wanna say
You lied to our Heavenly Father, when you made your vows
I'll get over it 'cause I'm through with you, I'm gonna make it somehow
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie

You can compliment me on the style of my hair
Give me marks out of ten for the clothes that I wear
You probably thought I had more upstairs
I disappoint you
I can see through
Your perfect smile
He likes to read books written for girls
He prides himself on being a man of the world
In the darkest of places he gets his thrills
He will disappoint you
If see through
His perfect smile
Now I think separation is okay
You're no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play
A fool
Play by your rules
Now my door has swollen from the rain
God knows we'll never see her face again
People get shattered in many ways
They can disappoint you
If you through
Their perfect smiles
Now I think separation is okay
'Cause you're no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted to me to play
A fool
Play by your rules
A fool
Play by your rules

I did it for love.
I did it for love.
I did it for love.
I did it for love.
What's hard for me,
I saw your game, but yet, and still you got me,
You touched the deepest part of me,
You got my heart, it's jumpin'.
I told you all of my secrets, didn't see betrayal,
One year, two months, and now it's over,
Didn't think we'd fail.
Lovin' you is causin' me to change,
And it hurts so bad, it don't feel the same.
And now my friends are askin' me what did I do,
I done hurt myself over loving you.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I know that I did you wrong.
Please forgive me, baby girl, I'm sorry.
You know that you did me wrong.
Why you cryin', baby girl, I'm sorry.
I know that I did you wrong.
Heaven knows I don't mean to hurt nobody.
You know that you did me wrong.
Let me take this time to say I'm sorry.
Lovin' you is causin' me to change,
And it hurts so bad, it don't feel the same.
And now my friends are askin' me what did I do,
I done hurt myself over loving you.
Oh, I
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I had some intentions, baby, but not on hurting you.
(I I I)I wanna make it up to you.
Did you see it in my heart?
I can't trust it anymore.
(I I I)I wanna make it up to you.
(I I I)I wanna make it up to you.
Did you see it in my heart?
I can't trust it anymore.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
Did it for love
Did it for love
Did it for love
Did it, did it, did it for love

I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way (way)
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Telling me not to let things get in my way
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Feels like I should be screaming
Trying to get it through to my friends
Sometimes it feels that life has no meaning
But I know things will be alright in the end
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway.

All of those wild american bilinguals
Who talk to you in paris of their lonely lives
School days and last days out there in the midwest
They climb on their liners and rejoin their wives
Walking down boulevards electric eyes
Would gaze at the waveforms and gasp at their size
Let them be lonely and say you don't care
Astro boy, i'm watching the proles on parade
Astro boy, i'm watching the proles on parade
Una with long hair will stand by your side
And the friends who were hungry could swallow your pride
Chromium pets that video screens would show
Pictures of helplessness old kings and queens
Radio stations that fade as in dust
All their transmitters are crumbling with rust
Let them be broken and say you don't care
Astro boy, i'm watching the proles on parade
Astro boy, i'm watching the proles on parade
Astro boy, i'm watching the proles on parade
Let them be broken and say you don't care
Astro boy, i'm watching the proles on parade

(One two) One two (One two) One two
(One two) (One two three four)......[gibberish talking]
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me
Ooh, mama please don't tell it to myself again
I know she thinks I've fought up my mind
But I'm a-really telling to my secret for real, but we get along just so fine
I got a friend that nobody hears, nobody hears but me
I got a friend that nobody hears, nobody hears but me
Oh I always wanna sleep while my daddy says, I'll kiss him when I turn out the light
But my friend is sitting on the edge of the day, turns from the evening into night
But everybody says he took a stage on him and everybody says I'm just a kid
Faith in the tunnel took the places on him
Well looky-looky-looky, well my fingers are ditty-ditty-ditty
Wop-bop-bop-a-lup-bop-a-lop-bam-boom
Well I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me
I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me, that's right now...
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody hears, nobody sees
Nobody's spoken to me, nobody cares, knows but me...

He sits low, in a shady grove
Where the trees arc slow, in the shape of 'you know'
Marble stairwells, waterfalls, egrets' heads and open arms
Whistling through his pensive teeth, the scene is set to peak
Like how the desert meets the reef
And steals the heart, of the thief
She walks slow, past the reach of home
In a Western World, far from the things she knows
Hanging gardens, patterned walls, the books of Rilke, orchestras
Motioning to the slow refrain, the soul is set to gain
Or swallow it whole
The causal chain, of human loam
And as seasons go, it's a lot like this
He reasons for a look, then a glance
To the path, where she passed
From the page of a book, to a perch in the grass
And as meetings go, it's a lot like this
She tiptoes from the path, to the edge of the page
Where she dared, to be asked
What's in a name?
What is your name?
And if you let me know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you have the time to talk to
I won't doubt you
And if I let you know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you, as if you start to fall
I'll be here to catch you
Turning around, he sighs, "will you sit next to me?"
Motioning forward, she replies, "will you walk next to me?"
"I know my lines, and there's a lot less space and a little bit of time"
"I know the play, it's fine"
Echoing herself, she says, "will you walk close to me?"
Holding his smile, he replies, "what more would you ask of me?"
"I know my mind, and there's a lot less space and a little bit of time"
"I know the way, it's fine"
And if you let me know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you have the time to talk to
I won't doubt you
And if I let you know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you, as if you start to fall
I'll be here to catch you
He's wasting time, you gotta take it slowly
May never get a chance like this
And she knows he's wasting time
And she loves the way he tries
Even though she knows the lines
She's taking time, you gotta let things grow
May never have a chance like this
And he knows she takes her time
And he keeps along her side
All hopes to keep along her side
As seasons go, it's a lot like this
He reasons for a look, then a glance
To the path, where she passed
From the page of a book, to a perch in the grass
And as meetings go, it's a lot like this
She tiptoes from the path, to the edge of the page
Where she dared, to be asked
What's in a name?
What is your name?

La, la, la
We know all about you, yes we do
La, la, la
We know all about you, yes we do
Oh, what you do
Where you go
We know all about you, yes we do
Where you live
Who you know
We know all about you, yes we do
Two nights for my own good I'm really going to hate the most
Why do we smile like the people that we hate the most?
We know all about you, yes we do
Cause you can't sleep tight
Uh-ho?
We know all about you, yes we do
Fighting demons in the night
Fighting demons, demons, demons
We know all about you, yes we do
No sleep tonight
No sleep, no sleep
We know all about you, yes we do
Oh, you're fightin' demons
La, la, la
La, la, la
What you do
Where you go
Where you live
Who you know
What you do
(What you do)
Where you go
(Where you go)
Where you live
(Where you live)
Who you know
We know all about you, yes we do
When you can't sleep tight
(When you can't sleep tight)
We know all about you, yes we do
Fighting demons in the night
(Fighting demons in the night)
We know all about you, yes we do
Oh, put to rest to night
Lying next tonight
We know all about you, yes we do
Woah, you're fighting demons
Oh, oh woah
Two nights for my own good I'm really going to hate the most
Why do we smile like the people that we hate the most?
Two nights for my own good I'm really going to hate the most
Why do we smile?
Why do we smile?
We know all about you, yes we do
We know all about you, yes we do

Oh baby, baby
I would never lie to you
I'm changing my direction, baby, like lovers do
I said : i want to break your heart - want to break your heart
Oh baby, baby
Wake me up before you go
I'm breaking this connection, lady and time will show
I said : i want lose your heart - i'll lose your eyes
Ever said : it has to be this way
No no, i never said : we'll make it one day
I said : ooh ooh ooh i love you
You're such a sexy thing my lady
Make my dreams come true
I said : ooh ooh ooh i love you
Come on, take my heart, my babe like great lovers do
Oh baby, baby
You're the line in my world
I'm feeling your emotion, lady
Come make my day
I said : i want to break your heart - want to break your heart
Oh baby, baby
You're so good and so bad
I'm feeling your emotion, lady
You drive me mad
I said : i want break your heart - i'll lose your heart
Ever said : it has to be this way
I never said never said : we'll make it one day

I have no use in waking
Sleep walking is all I do
I was no one to nobody
'Til the day that I met you
What good were all my dreams
But endless fantasy?
Just a heart that had no laughter
'Til the day you came to me
Then I looked into your eyes
I knew that love had come to me
So I held out my hand as I opened my heart and said
Darling please
I wanna be
Someone to somebody
And that someone is you
Don't you wanna be
Someone to somebody?
Then be my someone too
Oh, what good was all my freedom
With my heart tied up in chains
Though I claimed free expression
There was no way to explain
That I was filled with feelings
No one to show them to
What I hadn't known was that all along
I had saved my love for you
Now my days are so much warmer
And my nights no longer cold
'Cause you looked at me
And you held my hand and said
Darling, I wanna be

You see me at the bottom
Trying to get on top
You see me at the club
You know I se to rock
You see me crying tears
Lord make 'em stop
You see the sun shine
But never on my block
You see I'm trying to grow
Let me get ahead
You know I'm trying to do
What my mamma said
Lord I need a change
Lord feel my pain
Lord find me one
That ain't 'bout this game
I'm trying to find a man
I'm trying to find a ring
I'm trying to find someone
Who loves me more
Than their bling bling
Trying to be a wife
Trying to make a life
Trying to get in touch
With my spiritual side
Trying to have your back
Trying to help you stack
Trying to be your strength
When you know you lack
Lord I need a change
Lord tell me you feel my pain
So blu, so blu, so blu, so blu
You see me hustling for every cent i got
You see I never sleep
Until I reach the top
You see i can't slow down
Because you know it's real
You see I can't stop here
I gotta make a mill
I'm fitna be a woman
That stands the test of time
ain't afraid to say i'm fitna
Blow ya mind
I'm fitna be the one
You trust more than your boys
I'm fitna reach the level
Number one across the board
I'm trying to find a man
I'm trying to find a ring
I'm trying to find someone
Who loves me more
Than their bling bling
Trying to be a wife
Trying to make a life
Trying to get in touch
With my spiritual side
Trying to have your back
Trying to help you stack
Trying to be your strength
When you know you lack
Lord I need a change
Lord tell me you feel my pain

And it's open
For distraction
You found all the words you need
Well I found nothing
I just grumble
'cause I don't know what I feel
The moral to the story goes
Never leave your heart
Never leave your heart... alone
Run for shelter
An umbrella
Fights the rain but not the wind
And I'd be silly
To start preaching
'cause I don't know which point to make!
The moral to the story goes
Never leave your heart
In a box
Locked up
With cold cold ice
Never leave your heart
...Never leave your heart... alone
Am I frozen?
But it's summer!
Is that rain or is that me?
Yes I'm melting
Please be happy
One day soon
We might just swim
The moral to the story goes
Never leave your heart
In a box
Locked up with cold cold ice
Never leave your heart
....Never leave your heart
.... Never leave your heart alone

Faster than a speeding light,

Here comes one for the ladies
For the ones who love me
To think I thought I could be some kind of family man
I told myself I was straight
But I shouldn't have worried
'Cos my Maker had a better plan for me
And I'm dancing with the freaks now
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun
What you sow is what you reap now
I'll do my dance with everyone
I've been getting too much Sun
(Yes I'm dancin' with the freaks now)
We're havin', we're havin' too much fun for them
Look who's talking Guilty feet now'
Well let me tell you people
It's an easier affair
Not living my life with other people on my mind
No, got nothing to hide from anyone
Yes, I'm walking on new air
Just living my life
Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine
See I don't have the time
For the haters
And all the time that I wasted
How careless of me
Too young and stupid to see
I put my life in their hands
(Gonna look for Cupid, man)
Oh, and I know that they want me to hate them
There's no hurry
I'll just have to be the bigger man
Dancin' with the freaks now
I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun
What you sow is what you reap now
I'll do my dance with everyone
I've been getting too much Sun
If I turn the other cheek now
Would that be, would that be too much fun for them'
Look who's talking
Guilty feet now'
Well let me tell you people
It's an easier affair
Not livin' my life with other people on my mind
No, got nothing to hide from anyone
'Cos I'm walking on new air
Just living my life
Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine
See I don't have the time for the haters
Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong
Or that you won't find love
Don't let them use my life to put your future down
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found
For my life
Take it to the streets
There are stories you can keep
They're just passing you by
Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough
Don't let them tell you that it's wrong
Or that you won't find love
Don't let them use my life to put your future down
Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found

Can't you see that you're for me (ooh ha)

To make me know you understand

That's good, baby that's good
Ooh, honey babe I like your kind of love

He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say
At least not until the day
When something special he read
This is what it said
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
He called the number and a voice said: "Alice Whiting"
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said: "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat"
I can't forget what I read
This is what it said
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one

There's a party in your bedroom all night long

There's a lot of talk about you

Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight, don't say goodnight
Walkin' down the street, keepin' hush, hush on the scene
No one knows you, such a mystery
Opposite of fun 'til you turn the power on
Then you come out turnin' up the heat
Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your roof is on fire, you're losing control
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight don't say goodnight
Dancing with your hands turning strangers into friends
Touch the keys please and unlock my heart
You're free to be a freak, change your picture every week
Show the camera you're a super star
Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your roof is on fire, you're losing control
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you

Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone

Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight don't say goodnight
It's no debate, when I think of you can't stay on track
Cause I can't wait, can't stay on track, can't hide the fact
You're all I want, you're all I need
Let's get this party started, kick it hard just you and me
There's a party in your bedroom all night long

On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you see who you are
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You'll feel part of
Every mountain, sea, and shore
You can hear from far and near
A world you've never, never heard before
And on a clear day
On that clear day
You can see forever, and ever, and ever
And ever more

Hey lady, let me kick it to you first
You know I've come to realize
There's more to life than just
A hit and run
And I'm hanging up all that
You know what I'm saying
'Cause you mean more to me
Than anything, anything in this world, check it out
Well, well, well, you know this man can tell
Exactly what you want, baby and how you want it, oh girl
Hey, hey, hey, your love takes me away
I'll be your provider, lady, your lover and fighter, oh girl
No need to conceal what you feel
'Cause I'm the real deal
So don't fight it, can't deny it
Girl, with you I want to chill
I just wanna chill always and forever
No time to kill
So now until always and forever
Ain't no time to kill forever and ever and ever
Well, well, well, God bless the day we fell
Into each others arms, baby and shared the magic
Hey, my love is here to stay, yes
I'm burning with desire, baby, let me light your fire
Don't you ever spare
'Cause you know I do it so well
So don't fight it, can't deny it
Girl, with you I wanna chill
I'm just wanna chill always and forever
No time to kill
So now until always and forever
Ain't no time to kill forever and ever and ever and ever
Oh, you blow my mind, got me loving
Ooh, all the time your blowing my mind
Girl, you look so fine, you got me wanting you
All the time you look so fine and
So lay back, relax and just chill
'Cause there ain't no time to kill
My love will never do you wrong
'Cause you and I belong
Ooh, me and you
You and me
Just loving me endlessly
I don't wanna get over
You and me
Me and you
Endlessly, eternally

A wilted flower is your love, it blooms and then it dies
The love you lost or threw away, you should never find
(oooo-ooo-oooooo)
I did love you for who you were (ooooooo)
But the jealousy of some friend (controlled your mind)
(Your love is like a dying rose) dying rose
(It blooms so bright and then it goes) and then it goes
(You came with love and understanding, ooooo)
But left by a letter demanding
(Oh-wooo dying rose)
(Came with love and understanding)
And left by a letter demanding
(Your Love.......)
I feel pain that hurts so bad, no pain I just ca bear
I feel that I love you no more, but I do somewhere (ooo-ooo-oooooo)
I did love you for who you were
But the jealousy of some friend (Controlled your mind)
(Your love is like a dying rose)
Dying rose (Your love is like a dying rose, dying rose)

Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
So he swears he'll never marry
Says that cuddles are a curse
Just tell him plain
You're on the next train
If love don't get there first
Time and love
Everybody
Time and love
Nothing cures like
Time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
Nothing cures like
Time and love
(Nothing cures like
Time and love)
Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
You've been running
You've been rambling
And you don't know what to do
A holly golden wager says
That love will see you through
Time and love, everybody
Time and love (Oh, time and love)
Nothing cures like time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
Nothing cures like
Time and love
(Nothing cures like
Time and love)
Jesus wasn't angel
The mankind broke His wing
But Jesus gave His lifeline
So sacred bell could sing
Now a woman is a fighter
Gather white or African
A woman is a woman, inside
Has miracles for men at night
Time and love, everybody
Time and love (Oh, Time and love)
Nothing cures like
Time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
Nothing cures like time and love
Nothing cures like time and love

Nothing cures like time and love
Love for the man
If you can, if you please

Well the dice that I roll never seems to land on six
And that 48 card pack is short of some of my old tricks
The horse I bet on all those years ago
Is probably still running round the track
Like the marriage that I gambled on
I'm due my money back, I'm due my money back
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light
If your country code or your green cross code
It can leave a lasting mark
History books have showed follow safety code
And stamp out your final spark
Well the husband that I married once
I should've kept him in a cage
Kept him sitting waiting there
To show the tortoise middle-age
Cause you never back an animal that struggles on two legs
I'd rather back a stray with three than one that sits up and just begs
Than one that sits up and just begs
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light
If your country code or your green cross code
It can leave a lasting mark
History books have showed follow safety code
And stamp out your final spark
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light
If your country code or your green cross code

And stamp out your final spark
Milk will curdle, cheese go off, expensive wine mature
Kids grow up, parents down, husbands turn to tragic bore
Receipts and life insurance all very well, but don't fully cover hate
So you can't return this idiot when he's past his sell-by date
Milk will curdle, cheese go off, expensive wine mature
Kids grow up, parents down, husbands turn to tragic bore
Receipts and life insurance all very well, but don't fully cover hate
So you can't return this idiot when he's past his sell-by date

Looking for a different space
Searching for my inner place
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind
Who is this face I see
Why is this happening to me
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind
Things are changing
So much arranging of my life
I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again
So I woke up and there's the moon
Seems to have risen just a little soon
But who's calling out my name anyway?
I'm disorientated
I'm trying not to be jaded
When it's all so complicated
Cause I'm a little disorientated
Walking in a different space
Looking back just in case
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind
Love is forever
Hate was in the never
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind
Things are changing
So much arranging of my life
I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again
So I woke up and there's the clock
It was ticking backwards had I forgot
But what day is it anyway
I'm disorientated
I'm trying not to be jaded
When it's all so complicated
Cause I'm a little disorientated
Things are changing
So much arranging of my life
I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again
So I woke up and saw the sun
Seems like my life has just begun
How 'bout I start it today anyway

No greater love, no lesser grace
No great distance than the one that I have made
You crave my heart and miss our quiet time alone
Have I become as hard as stone?
[Chorus]
I need a one-man revival
A renewing of my heart
To capture me before I stray too far
It's the one thing I cry for
And the only way I know
Is a one-man revival in my soul (heart)
I know I've turned away it seems
But You pursue me while I'm busy chasing dreams
My dreams aren't worth the sacrifice of my first love
What I should be dreaming of...
[Chorus]
I'm disappointed at how my perfect world should be
But if I'm gonna see a change (really gonna see a change)
There's got to be a change in me
[Chorus]

It's time we said goodbye
Time now to decide
O' don't you feel so small
Dark is the night for all
It's time we moved out West
This time will be the best
And when the evenings fall
Dark is the night for all
It's time, yeah, to break free
It's time to pull away
For you and for me
It's time, yeah, to break free
We need to celebrate the mystery

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar candyman
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop shop, makes my panties drop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman, ooh, yeah
He took me to the Spider Club on Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman, ohh yeah
Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth it really hit the spot
He had lips like sugarcane
Good things come for boys who wait
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, candyman
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my ugh pop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop
Sweet sugar
He's got those lips like sugarcane
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one stop shop with a real big ugh
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman
Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
Squared herself away and let out a yell

Girl I can feel a tremor
through my body
Inside my heart is speeding
beating faster
Im running out of time
I see youre leaving
Ahou what a feeling
Ahou what a feeling.
I stumble fall and

barely make it
I take your hand and now

Begging

Under my shirt
Have to amass
Sling the tainted words
I'm each arms they fall on
It's my body
Puzzles the trick in me
I lend it out to borrow
It might survive
My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when
I'll revenge
All I'll need's that day
It's my body
Puzzles the trick in me
I lend it out to borrow
It might survive
My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when
I'll revenge
All I'll need's that day
I'll feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
True blue and real
I feel
I feel
True blue and real
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when
I'll revenge
All I'll need's that day
I'll feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I'll feel perpetual
True and real

You're pretty and you know it
You're stupid and you show it
If there's a soul behind your face at all
I'm struggling to see it
Now smile for the camera
You've got what they're after
Yes it's all you wanted
But it's that has suffer to suffer this
The best clubs in London you'll always be around them
But drinkin' ain't livin' and
Drinkin' ain't givin'
Nah drinkin's just drinkin's just drinkin'
My sister's father had a wife
Whose husband had a father
Who taught me how to live
But died all alone
And I wish that I was with him
I could tell him all the things that he's missed
And all the things that you think
When you think that you're alone
But, man, you can't see what's going on
At the minute you can do nothing wrong
Yes you are a fortunate son
But you won't fool the kids for long

There's a sword in your side that you'll ignore it
Until blood shows
And later on, when it's gone, when something's wrong
The violence grows
And it's designed, to spy and try
To poke your eyes, while laying low
Beneath the seven different reasons for satellites
Eleven different reasons for fists and fights
There's never been a reason for shouting where, it's quiet,
But no-ones ever listening
Seven different reasons for satellites
Eleven different reasons for fists and fights
There's never been a reason for shouting where, it's quiet,
But no-ones ever listening
When you need to shout, shout
When you need to shout, shout
When you need to shout, shout
No-ones ever listening
When you need to shout, shout
When you need to shout, shout
When you need to shout, shout
No-ones ever listening

When I looked in your eyes
Felt the spirit of man
Demanding more than just a smile
Took a chance for a while
Speaking in tongues
That float us down rivers
The past will remind us
All colours we chose
When I told you those lies
Felt the spirit of love
Demanding more than compromise
Took a chance for a while
Speaking in tongues
That float us down rivers
The past will remind us
All colours we chose
Some people say that the way that we live
Is out of this place
And some people say that the way that we live
Is blinded by fate
All colours we chose

Who would have thought the world could end
Make believe was to defend
Another day
Another year
Against the multitudes of fear
As heaven lost it's will to kill
Since the day our earth stood still
Another dance
Another swirl
Defiling every boy and girl
Our world is coming down
I see the signs
They're all around
All around
Like footprints on the ground
An infant cradling in the dirt
In spite of those who gave her birth
Lucifer
Is gaining girth
The sacrifice has lost it's worth
Crucified upon a screen
Death becomes a picture dream
Another lie
Another stone
To push us further down below
Our world is coming down
I see the signs
They're all around
All around
Like footprints on the ground

There used to be a time
I wore my heart upon my sleeve.
There used to be a time
I'd show my gentle side to anyone
Through these years of wandering
I know I've been deceived.
Through these years of wandering
And every time you try to hurt me
You know you'll only hurt yourself.
And every time you try to hurt me
I know you'll be the one to suffer
When you think you're hurting someone.
A little of you, a little of me,
A little of you,
Is hurting someone
Don't tell me I'm the only one
'Cause I don't need that space.
Don't ask for love
I'll throw it back in your face.
All of these promises
Were only made to break.
All of these promises

Our loneliness is coming so let's give us a try
Who wouldn't try?
If we're our only witness then we owe us a lie
Who wouldn't lie?
Tossing a coin
Chances are you won't love that boy
There's time to invest
You've locked your heart in some secret chest
I'll never find love
I find it hard to sleep
When words alone can't keep me
Happy in love
Our loneliness is coming so let's give us a try
Who wouldn't try?
And time is fighting love but then we gave it that right
Who isn't right?
I've got my eye on you, baby

Your lips could never show a smile.
You never tried you just put me in a file.
I never lived inside your hole, child.
I thought you needed me I never had no style.
Never say never say never again.
Never say never say never again.
You said goodbye, I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again
Your eyes could never show a grin.
You never tried you just put me in a tin.
I never lived inside your hole child.
You know I needed you.
And look at the shape I'm in.
Never say never say never again.
Never say never say never again.
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again.
Your lips could never show a smile.
You never tried you just put me in a file.
I never lived inside your hole child.
I thought you needed me.
I never had no style.
Never say never say never again.
Never say never say never again.
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again.
Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain.
Never say never say never again.
Never never never never
Never never

Great fire burning
You supplied the spark
Fores burning spreading through the ark
Animals are panicking
I'm animal and panicking
Your glance a match on the tinder wood
You never spoke but I understood
Bring water
Eyes bring water
[Chorus:]
Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart
Great fire burning
All because of you
Fires burning spreading through the zoo
Animals are panicking
I'm animal and panicking
No round of drinks can extinguish this
Feeling of love and engulfing bliss
Bring water
Eyes bring water
[Chorus]
I've been in love before
But it's never been as hot as this
Smoke curling round the door
Memories of old loves crack and blister
Mister fireman bet you couldn't put me out if you tried
Your glance a match on the tinder wood
You never spoke but I understood
Bring water
Eyes bring water
[Chorus]

Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'
For the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to
Take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs are written
With a broken heart
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'
For the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to
Take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs are written
With a broken heart
(Look at, look at, the future I cannot see)
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'
For the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to
Take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs are written
With a broken heart
It's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'
For the music to start
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song

Time has come again
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside of my life
Now I'm lost
Inside of you
Lost in the music
And lost in your eyes
I could spend all of my time
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring
Darling being close to you
Made all ...
Made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
Now I'm lost inside of you

I don't even know the real me anymore
I can't even show how I feel
I hit the floor
I'm talking rock bottom
My feelings I fought em
I can't believe it's come to this
'Cause I need to a grip on reality
Now i wanna feel some sensitivity
I'm here, i'm telling you i
Cleared my life
I changed my head
Trying to catch my skin again
I'm finding out what makes me wanna live
By living it up again
It's my world
I paved my way
Found my sensitivity
I stepped back from the edge
Now i'm living it up again
I've been doing fine in my misery
Not crazy
I told them not to worry about me
But everytime i wanna feel some sensitivity
I'm here, i'm telling you i
Cleared my life
I changed my head
Trying to catch my skin again
I'm finding out what makes me wanna live
By living it up again
It's my world
I paved my way
Found my sensitivity
I stepped back from the edge
Now I'm living it up again
Living it up again
Living it up again
Living it up now i'm not crazy i'm just sensitive
I stepped back from the edge
I cleared my life
I changed my head
Trying to catch my skin again
I'm finding out what makes me wanna live
By living it up again
It's my world
I paved my way
Found my sensitivity
I stepped back from the edge
Now I'm living it up again
Living it up again
I'm living it up again
Living it up now i'm not crazy i'm just sensitive
Living it up again
I'm living it up again
Living it up now i'm not crazy i'm just sensitive

I can't believe she's gone
I can't believe that
We're not together anymore
Something in her eyes,
I've never seen before
It took me by surprise
When she said, "I'm not in love anymore"
Oh, baby, I keep holdin' on, can't let go
Please let me know
Why does it rain?
Why does it hurt?
Please God explain
'Cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, now I just cry
Please tell me why
(Oh, my baby)
Why does it rain?
We used to be as one
We never were apart
(No)
The sun was always shinin' in my heart
Now those days are gone
I miss the love we had
No one ever told me
Life could be so sad
Oh, baby
I keep holdin' on, can't let go
Please let me know
Why does it rain?
Why does it hurt?
Please God explain
'Cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, now I just cry
Please tell me why
(Oh, tell me)
Why does it rain?
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Oh, my baby)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I keep holdin' on, can't let go
Please let me know
Ooh, why does it rain?
Why does it hurt?
Please God explain
'Cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, now I just cry
Please tell me why
Why does it rain?
(Why does it hurt?)
Please God explain
'Cause I don't understand
Love made me fly
(Ooh, ooh)
(Now I just cry)
Please tell me why
(Ooh, no)
Why does it rain?

And we are growing along spiritual lines
Will never mean we should stop to have big fun time
Oh oh oh
Should it be for the very first of all to pray
and to report it to your next in an effective way
But whatever our ideals turn to be
We must be willing to break it through
We must be willing to make amends where we
Ever have to put some harm on too
She is my she's my all
She is my all surrounding solid booze you know
She is my all surrounding solid booze you know
She is my all surrounding solid booze you know
And we are growing along the spiritual lines
Would never mean we should believe in all those
Different kinds
Oh oh oh
Could it be the very first of all to recognize
Its the better sense to take it once and give it twice
But whatever our ideals turn out to be
We should be willing to break it through
We should be willing to realize
That attitudes have got us too
She is my
She's my all

This heart`s up for sale
Yeah, this heart`s on the stand
Mix and match and melt in my mouth
Nothing ever goes quite as planned
You fly north and I`ll sail south
So redevelop product
Redesign this package
Still refuse to reach in your pocket
Everything is temporary written on that sand
Looking for the girl that meets supply with demand
Love has no guarantee
(Yes I`m date stamped)
Promise me eternity
(Guess I`ll fade away)
Even with a pedigree
(Yes I`m date stamped)
Love has no guarantee
That heart`s on display, yes, that heart`s off the rails
A ship in the harbour with wind in its sails
Chain up love inside the chain-store girl
Chain up love and exchange it
Is Monsieur a connoisseur or just short-changed?
Off the rack or custom-fit it all seems the same
Look but don`t touch in paradise
Don`t let them catch you damaging the merchandise
Love has no guarantee
(Yes I`m date stamped)
Promise me eternity
(Guess I`ll fade away)
Even with a pedigree
(Yes I`m date stamped)
Love has no guarantee
I get sales talk from sales assistants
When all I want to do girl, is lower your resistance
Everything is temporary, written in the sand
Looking for the girl that meets supply with demand
Love has no guarantee
Brings out the woman in me
Even with a pedigree
Love has no guarantee
No chance of subtlety
No promise of eternity
Even with a pedigree
Love has no guarantee

What is there to say
When all the love has slipped away
In a half a minute
There is always something we can blame,
But in the end,it's just the same
Suddenly you'll find yourself alone
Half a minute
Half a minute
What is there to say
When every dream just fade away
In a half a minute
Every explanation we can find,
Will never change it,we are through
Suddenly you'll find yourself alone
Half a minute
Half a minute
Suddenly you'll find yourself alone
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute

Even after all
The murdering
Even after all
You're suffering sow
You know I love you so
You know I love you so and so
Even after all
All that you go on, sir
Is the order of the day
And all that you believe, sir
Is the order in this society
You know I love you so
You know I love you so and so
Even after all
This is my manner y'all
Man just feel satisfied
No competition
No competition at all
I just feel satta star
Them eyes are gorgeous girl
No demise, upraise
I got to raise it again
Them eyes are gorgeous
I must advance
I don't check for no superficial
It's got to be beneficial
These sonic fruits
These sonic fruits
Sights
These sonic fruits
Got them moving around alright
Hyper play
Steppin' and rising
Even after all
The murdering that go on
Even after all, oh no
Your suffering sow
You know I love you so
You know I love you so and so
Even after all

When Jamie died
And I didn't even understand
The eternity of my sadness
I wished I could have prevented it
When I rest in bed
Dream about how I could have
Lived and played with my brother
How I wished that I could have saved him
If wishing could bring him back
He'd be here with me today
But then, I remember...
It happened anyway
When I look at pictures
And imagine what he would be like
Now a dozen years old
I wish I could have saved him from agelessness
If crying could bring him back
He'd be here with me today
But then, I remember...
It happened anyway
When I think of why and how
He was with us and he left us
I wished I could have prevented it
And stopped his death, and saved him from
Never needing breath for birthday candles...
For birthday candles
If wishing could bring him back
He'd be here with me today
But then, I remember...

Oh so lonely
If only you
Would pull through
Things we have learnt
Now we have returned
We find it strange
To find nothing exchanged
I've been out of the way
I've been out of the way
This is a blast
To the past
Better late
Than bitter and lost
I've been out of my mind
I've been out of my mind to find you
Oh so lonely
If only you would pull through
Fire burn
Money is earned
I found a friend
Money is burned
I've been out of my mind
I've been out of my mind to find you
Things I have learnt
Now I have returned
I find it strange to find nothing has changed
I've been out of the way

Heartaches and so much pain
Cry out to you in vain
I'll keep my promises, oh darling
Don't let this sweet love die
So many reasons why
I'll keep my promises oh darling, oh yeah
I'll wait for you my sweet love
[Chorus]
Years may come
And years may go
Still there's one thing that I know
That my heart is only beating
Just for you, darling
Only a fool would let you go
I will always love you so
For my heart is only waiting just for you
Time passes by so slow
With every hour I know
I'll keep my promises, sweet darling
The stories that you hear
Jealous words have no fear
I'll keep my promises, sweet darling, oh, oh
I adore you my, sweet love
[Chorus x2]

Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
Step right up, step right up
Come closer, you won't believe your eyes
Behind this curtain
Witness something you've never seen before
Heard before, dreamt before
The most amazing show on earth
La la la la la la la
It's the most amazing show on earth
La la la la la la la
Do you want to be widely entertained
People to know your name?
Do you crave fame?
Well, they say things aren't always what they seem to be
Even your greatest fantasies
You won't believe your eyes
Won't even recognize
The wonderment that lies
Behind the shimmer and the lights
Is it true what they say?
Is it all just fun and games?
Or is there more behind the makeup
And the faces full of paint?
I ask you, do you want to come and play?
Ha ha ha ha
Get the world to come and play
Ha ha ha ha
So sit back, relax, fasten your seat belts
It's going to be a bumpy ride to the other side

Everything ends the way it begins
God takes care of the little things

Yo, I'm diggin' your style, yeah
She was so fly
She was alright
She looked like she came from that paradise
She was so thrown
She was so cold
'Cause she already knew she had it goin on
Them pretty Ass toes
The way she rolls
Everything about her looked so dope
Her independent ways, bills all paid
What else could you ask for now a days
'Cause you know I've been peepin' you awhile
I really like and dig your sexy style
So won't you turn and come around my way
I'll show you what i'm gonna do
And i'll show you how i feel for you
Yeah
You got me diggin' your style
Oh
Can we kick it for a while
Can we kick it for a while
For a little while yeah
So baby can i get your

You don't have to say, I love you everyday
You do it
And you don't have to try to keep me satisfied
You do it, yes, you do
Look what you have done, you're the only one
Who can take me away
And when you can't be mine, I spend all my time
Just waiting
Till you came back around 'cause no one else I found
Can do it
The way you do it to me when you love me, boy
I really do love the way you do it, you do it, do it
When I need to feel, the way I love to feel
You do it, do it
I can't live without the way you know how
To do it
Tell me what did I do right to get you in my life
When I need you, need you to stay
At times it almost seems, I stepped into a dream
And you hold me
I guess, I'm tryin' to say, can't do without the way
You do it
The way you do it to me when you love me, boy
I really do love the way you do it, doin' the way that you do it
What did I do right to get you in my life
When I need you, need you to stay
At times it almost seems, I step into a dream
And you hold me
I guess, I'm tryin' to say, can't do without the way
You do it
The way you do it to me when you love me, boy
I really do love the way you do it, do love the way you do it, yes, I do
I really do love the way you do it
You don't have to say, I love you everyday
'Cause you do it, oh yes, you do
Anyone alive can't keep me satisfied
Like you do it, oh, you do it, baby
I really do love the way you do it
(I really love the way you do it)
You do
(Do love the way you do it)
I really do love the way you do it
(Kinda like the way you feeling for me)
You do
I really do love the way you do it
(I really love the way you do it)
(Do it to me when you do it)
You do
(Kinda like to feel the way you make me feel)
I really do love the way you do it
(Ooh, make me feel the way you make me do it)
You do
I really do love the way you do it
You do
I really do love the way you do it
You do

I've been so happy since I walked away
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today
'Cause you were nothing but a big mistake
And life is wonderful, now that I'm rid of you
Oh, I must have been crazy to have stayed with you
I can't believe I thought I was in love with you
But now the scales have fallen, I can really see
And I say go to hell 'cause that's where you took me
Well, I've felt better since I slammed that door
You always cramped my style, I never noticed before
It's been a non-stop party since I flew the coop
I can't believe I fell for such a loser like you
And is it any wonder that I felt so blue
When I was always having to put up with you?
Oh, here we go again, just lay the blame on me
Don't say another word 'cause sweetheart, you're history
I know that you miss me really, bet you wish that you still had me
You'll never find someone like me but I've got no regrets at all
Because I've met this girl and she's so good to me
She's really beautiful, fantastic company
And when I'm with her I realize what love can be
Because she's fifty times the person you'll ever be
Good luck, mister, do you think I care?
Since you've been gone the offers have been everywhere
I've got a million guys just lining up for me
I've turned a corner, boy, my life is ecstasy
Well, I've been in heaven since I walked away
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today
'Cause you were nothing but a waste of space
And life is wonderful now that I'm over you
Over you
Over you

Take the Key and you'll find
Loving you makes me feel
Oh, I hold a key in my heart
You know its true
and when the time is right
I shall give it, ah, give it to you
I never want another love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
And I want you easily
I know that you see
I never felt this way before
I want this feeling forever more
The way you do the things you do
you've won me over, oh
Got me going out my mind
Thinking about you all the time
Open up the doors too much (take the key and you'll find)
All my feelings are for real
Play the cards and I will deal
Cause I just want you to know (loving you makes me feel)
In times despair, the way I'd feel would be
Unconditional, eternal, everlasting
Oh, you know that I'd feel complete
I never want another love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
And I want you easily
I know that you'll see
I never felt this way before
I want this feeling forever more
The way you do, the things you do
You won me over, oooohhhhh
Got me going out my mind,
Thinking about you all the time
Open up the doors too much (take the key and you'll find)
All my feelings are for real
Play the cards and I will deal
Cause I just want you to know (loving you makes me feel)
I never want another love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
You're a true trooper, super cool No.1, hon'
I could play pool, bet poker over you
Guaranteed to love you cause I'm an All Saint fool
(Loving you makes me feel)
So let me count the ways in which I love thee
All in all this can't be untrue or a fantasy
Telling no more lies
Your love is taking me high
Cause (loving you makes me feel)
Got me going out my mind,
Thinking about you all the time
Open up the doors too much (take the key and you'll find)
All my feelings are for real
Play the cards and I will deal
Cause I just want you to know (loving you makes me feel)
Got me going out my mind,
Thinking about you all the time
Open up the doors too much (take the key and you'll find)
All my feelings are for real
Play the cards and I will deal
Cause I just want you to know (loving you makes me feel)
Got me going out my mind,
Thinking about you all the time
Open up the doors too much (take the key and you'll find)
All my feelings are for real
Play the cards and I will deal
Cause I just want you to know (loving you makes me feel)
Got me going out my mind,
Thinking about you all the time
Open up the doors too much (take the key and you'll find)

If life is a river and your heart is a boat
And just like a water baby, baby born to float
And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
And your heart is Amelia dying to fly
Heaven knows no frontiers and I've seen heaven in your eyes
And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates
Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
And we stack all the dead men in self addressed crates
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
That somehow this black night
Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day
When fear will lose its grip
And heaven has its ways
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails
And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
And your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
That somehow this black night
Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip
And heaven has its ways
And heaven has its ways
When all will harmonise
And you know what's in our hearts
The dream will realise
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes

Ill take it any time that I can get it
Your heart can feel like mine
If you just let it baby
It will be something soft
Ill want to pet it
No matter what the cost
You wont regret it baby
In morning
There is a light that shines
It only happens at the right time
So you gotta get up, wake up
Open up your eyes
I fake it every time I say forget it
Our hearts will heal in time
Dont even sweat it baby baby
If things get really mixed up
Ill give you credit
We have that kind of love
Dont be upset baby
Dont be upset baby
Dont be upset with me

Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And its not worth another try
Familiar place familiar face
But feeling's not the same
Try to relive what we once did
Its just a silly game
Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And its not worth another try
One of the crowd
It felt so safe
I never felt alone
Together everyday and night
When you and me were young
Ooh ooh ooh...
Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And its not worth another try
Time that lapsed a bond collapsed
We never planned for that
You felt betrayed I let you down
You're better on your own
Ooh ooh ooh...
Cheers then, it had to end
Cheers then, another try
Cheers then, here's two old friends
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye
Cheers then...

Don't make a sound, it's time to throw it into lock down
Watch me knock down this mess
That I've got myself into for a small commission
I'll show you how
If you just get off the ground
You've got to move a little faster
To make it out of this disaster
Before you get factored out
Turn the page, another line I should have saved
But who's to say that you wouldn't be blown away
'Cause you've always been blown away
Anchor, come and drag me down, before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Leave me for dead, I always said you'd find me in over my head
Now you can take it literal instead
I'm bringing it back
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive
Call off the search, there's been no sign for and days
And theres no way to say for sure if less is more
I'm sweating out the fever that's been spreading on the dance floor
Pick your feet up on the ground
You got to move a little faster
Faster to make it out of this disaster
Will you last or will you fall to your knees
Turn the page, another line I should have saved
But who's to say that you wouldn't be blown away
'Cause you wouldn't be blown away
Anchor, come and drag me down, before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Leave me for dead, I always said you'd find me in over my head
Now you can take it literal instead
I'm bringing it back
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive
At first with all the weight of all this pressure I was fine
But now I feel like I have buried myself alive
Drag me out and push me down
But hurry up before the surface freezes over now
I'm going to drown
I'm going down without a sound
Anchor, come and drag me down
Anchor, come and drag me down
Anchor, come and drag me down
Anchor, come and drag me down
Before I take the dive
Anchor, come and drag me down before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Leave me for dead, I always said you'd find me in over my head
Now you can take it literal instead
I'm bringing it back
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive
Before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive

Well I always knew you'd take the crutches
And not the skis
1 always knew you'd take the stilts
And then your knees
When God gave you the sky
I knew you'd take the trees
Son you've grown those chicken wings
You just can't fly
They anchored our dream yacht to ocean bed
Chained our ideal home to bicycle shed
Clamped our racing car before we sat in driver's seat
Tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree
We could've courted Einstein
Could've courted Marx
We could've gone for strolls
Like other families do in parks
Son you were born a dud
In a family without sparks
Yes you've got those chicken wings
You just can't fly
The checkered flag
That losers despise
Never flew in our port
Or harbored in our eyes
Cause we always formed that queue
For second prize
This family's got those chicken wings
We just can't fly
Our winning tickets ripped up into shreds
The tale of this family, is its heads
We're bouncing on a pogo stick
Without any springs
It hurts me to admit this
But we've got those chicken wings
Yes you've got those chicken wings
And all the luggage that the failure brings
Is a swallow flying high that sings
Look he's got those chicken wings
He may as well die

[Chorus]
Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love, oh yeah
Morning, noon, and at night
Never gonna let you out of sight
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love
Tell me that you really care
Run your fingers through me hair
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
And I'm in paradise
[Chorus]
Tell me that you really care
Run your fingers through me hair
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
And I'm in paradise
[Chorus]
The three kisses of love

There's nobody here
To tell us a joke
We tear off our ears
The fire that we stoke
You wrote me a note
The pages were blank
And I, I should have known
Invisible ink
I know that I am yours and you will be mine
Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine
You carry this dirt
We stole from the source
Its tongue will be hurt
Attack from the north
The color was red
The number was six
Now you're in my head
No more to convince
I know that I am yours and you will be mine
Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine
I bring this back home
Just hoping I've changed
So that you will know
Just how I'm deranged
But you're off on your search
You're crying, then went to church
You're safe, or at least I heard
Until to me you return
I know that I am yours and you will be mine
Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine

Each night I dream
The same old dream
I cannot forget it seems
The beach where I found you
Where I lost you too
I see the strand
The silv'ry sand
We are going hand in hand
Like we used to do
Like we used to do
* Marigot Bay
Paradise of the blue lagoon
Tell me, why you are haunting me
By night and by day
Marigot Bay
Paradise of the blue lagoon
Where my heart was all aflame
I will never forget your name
Oh, Marigot Bay
You said to me:
You must believe
Darling that I've never been
So in love before
So in love before
Our love was strong
That nights were long
But one morning you were gone
Gone for ever more
Gone for ever more
* (Repeat 2 times and fade)

What a dream,
I could be
Feeling
Silk of softness
Why alone
I'll be lonely
With you
Do I want
For diamond skies
Will you take me
Not a sound
I would hear
Everything
Everything I hear
Lay me down.
Dance, can we?
Cast as one
Into the sea
Will you
Take of me

Mary, I was looking in the mirror for you
Mary, I'll serve for you
Mary, I am cursed by the cross that I carry
Mary, I was looking in the mirror for you
Mary, I'm so cold
Mary, Whatever happened to you?
Mary, The ghosts I'm been haunted by are hospital men
Mary, I am so cursed by the cross that I carry
Mary, I did not ask for any of this
Mary, I only did what I told me to do
Mary, I've been looking in the mirror for you
Mary, I was cursed by the cross that I carry
The double with a kissing fetish.
Say my name,
If he will guide the tongue

You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
I've got your name on my credit card
Now I go shopping shopping
I know I was born with an expectation
At rainbow's end, there's a pot of gold
Who's gonna pay for my reservation
For whom will I keep my love on hold
You thought you could count on my devotion
Thought you could play with my emotions
I ain't gonna let things go your way
You're still gonna hear me say
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
I've got your name on my credit card
Now I go shopping shopping
You said, "I could trust your love forever"
Seemed like a perfect to do
You said that we'd always be together
Then came the day when we were through
I know that I put my love on offer
When I saw the sunshine in your coffer
It's time that you pay my promise back
A sheer little shop attack
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
I've got your name on my credit card

Didn't you ever want to climb
The highest mountain you could find?
Didn't you ever want to do it all?
Didn't you ever want to do it all?
Long ago I heard a voice
Telling me I had no choice
Take a chance 'cause even if you fall
At least you know you tried to do it all
Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Some things in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free
And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good
Didn't you ever want to feel
Just the part of life that's real?
After all we're dealing with the truth here
Isn't it the truth we're going for?
And if somewhere along the line
Your dreams are lying close to mine
Maybe you and I could have it all
Maybe you and I could have it all
Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Somethings in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free
And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good
Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Somethings in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free
And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good
Some changes are for good

Well how do you do, young Willy McBride,
Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
I see by your gravestone you were only 19,
You joined the great fallin' in 1916.
Well I hope you died quick, and I hope you died clean.
Willy McBride, was it slow and obscene?
[Chorus:]
Did they beat the drums slowly,
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound a death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind,
In some faithful heart, is your memory in shrine?
And though you died back in 1916,
In that faithful heart, you're forever 19.
Or are you a stranger without even a name,
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane.
In an old photograph, torn and battered and stained,
And faded to yellow in a brown yellow frame.
[Chorus]
Now Willy McBride, I can't help wondering why
Do those who lie here know why they died.
Did they really believe when they answered the cause,
Did they really believe that this war would end wars?
But the sorrow, the sufferin', the glory, the pain
The killing and dying were all done in vain.
But, Willy McBride, it all happened again, and again, and again, and again, and again.
[Chorus]
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?

Does it pay well, does it
Does it pay, what does it pay?
Every work hard day of the year
Kept hidden away, what does it pay
Everyday like this, heaven sent with a kiss
Don't throw it away, what does it pay?
Does it pay well, does it
Does it pay, what does it pay?
Every word you say, heard it all before
Taken off on us all, you'd better to stay
What does it pay, every work hard day
Don't throw it away, don't throw it away
Does it pay well, does it
Does it pay, what does it pay?
Does it pay to be so cruel,
A single minded, reckless fool
Don't throw it away, what does it pay?
Every work hard day,
You don't throw it away
Does it pay well, does it
Does it pay, what does it pay?
Very work hard day
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away

I thought I heard a sound
Somebody calling out to me
So I turned around
Strangers as far as I could see
Drifting through this crowd
Barely awake form last night's dream
I call your name out loud
I never thought you'd answer
You came out of nowhere, baby
Just when I felt like giving up
Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality
This side of eternity
Why'd you take so long?
Man, I thought you'd never get here
I waited for the dawn
Never finding you was my one fear
It's dark before it's light
And just when you can't believe your eyes
Morning breaks bright, and the storm is over
You came out of nowhere, baby
Just when I felt like giving up
Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality
This side of eternity
You came out of nowhere, baby
Just when I thought it was all too much
Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality
This side of eternity
It might have rained for the rest of my life
But you came along
It could have been pain for all of these nights
But you came to stay
You came out of nowhere, baby
Just when I felt like giving up
Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality
This side of eternity

She's a perfect 10, but she wears a 12
Baby keep a little 2 for me
She could be sweet 16, bustin' out at the seams
It's still love in the first degree
When he's at my gate, with a big fat 8
You want to see the smile on my face
And even at my door, with a poor poor 4
There ain't no man can replace
'Cause we love our love,
in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
If he's extra large well I'm in charge
I can work this thing on top
If he's XXL well what the hell
Every penny don't fit the slot
The anorexic chicks, the model 6
They don't hold no weight with me
Well 8 or 9, well that's just fine
But I like to hold something I can see
'Cause we love our love,
in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty
But I've had to fit a second hand
I've bought a calendar, and every month
Is taken up by lover man
'Cause we love our love,
in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight

She leaves her brains at the door
She drops her guts on the floor
She only listens out for everyday noises
She very calmly ignores
The little things she abhors
She`s made her mind up to be tidy
It could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It could change
He keeps his fingernails neat
He cleans the car once a week
He keeps an eye out for resistible bargains
But every night in his sleep
He dreams of sex on the street
He longs for pantyhose and roses
It could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It will change, it could never
It could change, change
Oh
All these years, all this time
Learn to suffer, compromise
Turn away, tolerate
Learn to suffer what you hate
And it could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It could change, it will never
It will change, it could never
It could change, change
You got me walking alone
You got me walking alone
You got me walking alone
You got me walking alone

A cup of tea, a cup of tea
I've been driving all night, you won't turn on your light that easily
A neon sign offers some shelter across the street
Guess I'll drink my trouble down with a cup of tea
You're over me, you're over me
I howl at your room like a wolf to the moon going crazy
Ring one more time, I won't be off [?]
Guess I'll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea
But it's getting cold in here, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised you'd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
I let it be, try to let it be
I'll be hot to your touch, you say I think too much, call me 'baby'
And it'll all be fine once you are walking up the street
'Til then I'll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea
But darling, it's getting cold in here, yeah, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised you'd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
A cup of tea, a cup of tea
She's holding your waist like she'd give you a taste so easily
I won't cry, no, I'll just watch, and I will see
And I'll say my last goodbye with a cup of tea

my heart is broken into 10,000 thousand pieces or more
cause you hurt me so much
when i found out i wasn't your one true life
it was with someone else
i cried every day every night
cause i loved you so much
why does your heart get broken everytime you fall in love???
well you cannot back down to the one you found
you say you regret everything
should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind
i should have listen to my friends
when they said you're nothing
it wouldn't last to the end babe
never thought it would
i thought you were different
bye my love forever i'll miss you
we'll you're in the past now
you cannot back down to the one you found
you say you regret everything
should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind
you're out of my life now!

comes a flooding of the stage
we'll be waiting in it's wake
sifting through old men and their plays
leads us to greater thoughts to crave
tell me glacier where you been
and why your posture is so poor
I hear the heats been coming in
I see the sun is at your door
small deaths come too late
oh my brother went to make
his name amongst the sharks and men
he had a heart of gold I think
but when he left it wasn't there
now he hoped to all he'd make.
yea he'd been saving, he'd been saving
so much to have but nothing gained
all boarded up now in his grave
small deaths come too late
do you intend to
hold your affection til you die
I know why you wait
not until you try
do you attempt to
feign your infection cause the
tide is telling you wait
not until you're tied.
no more time to carry with you(4x)
tend to the sound
of what you believe in
we can't we can't all
we can't we can't all be that way
when you were young and it was fascination
we can't we can't all
we can't we can't all
tend to the sound
of what you believe in
we can't we can't all
we can't we can't all be that way
when you were young and it was fascination
we can't we can't all
we can't we can't all(x32)

Hey, hey what became of you
And change, had it changed your tune
How long you wade inside the swirling swirling pool
Just in your own way
For miles, miles now I've been led
These wild, wild things in your head
Lead me blindly down where angels fear to tread
Just in your own way
Now can you feel, can you feel a change
It's circled 'round, it's come back down again
But I'll no longer shower here in someone else's rain
Just in your own way
Now time gets the best of you
Of wine and celestial views
Keep me anchored, keep me sane
Keep me confused
Just in your own way

Where are you?
I need you
I'm crying out
I'm crying
Where are you?
I need you
I'm crying out
I'm crying
After all my wandering
God, I am coming home

I'm in a van and you're holding my hand
You're traveling with me through forest and sands
I've been innocently learning a language
And you've been taking full advantage, haven't you?
Oh, don't say it's true
I've lost a friend, I've been silenced again
And we kissed once, hey, but that was in lust
I know you need more than giving moments
And sentimental stories and words only spoken seemingly
And I won't win your heart that way
Oh, it feels like none of this is real
I pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze
Like a river in Toronto then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm inside
It feels like none of this is real
I pretend that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze
Like a river in Toronto then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm inside

When it's summer
And the skies are glass
When it's summer
And the skies are glass
I just have to make the evenings last
They're always flashing past
And when it's raining
And the skies are black
When it's raining
And the skies are black
I just have to hear the thunder roll
And see the lightening crack
With fading powers
We sit for hours
By a television screen
With funny cigarettes
And talk for hours
Of places that we've seen
Brother can you hear my voice
Brother can you hear my voice
Every second that you cling to life
You have to feel alive
It's an easy thing to sell your skin
It's an easy thing to sell your skin
When the devil's banging on your door
You always let him in
With fading powers
We dream of hours
That'll never come again
Old defenders are themselves defenceless
When the mad attack the sane
What can you do
When you see no future in front of you
Food for the few
So many it seems are in front of you
I see my face
Reflecting there in a sweating brow
You hate what you see
But what can you do when there's no way out
No way out now
But when you sleep
Where do you go

The map has gone.
It's burning in the afternoon.
The smell's so strong.
No chance to wait away.
Gold medallions for the proud men in kahki.
Battalions of strangers. Battalions of strangers.
No one wants to lead the way.
Be the first death of the day.
Leave his family behind.
It must all be in the minds of
Battalions of strangers. Battalions of strangers...
Battalions of strangers. Battalions of strangers...
The sound of guns has given way to children's cries.
The war has come home.
The black smoke and the hordes of flies.
Gold medallions for the citizens who stand and wait.
Battalions of strangers. Battalions of strangers...
No one wants to lead the way.
Be the first death of the day.
Leave his family behind.
It must all be in the minds of
Battalions of strangers...
...Battalions of strangers.
The voice of calm from Moscow to the Pentagon.
Sound the alarm, and try to back the better one.
Gold medallions for men who must negotiate.
Battalions of strangers... Battalions of strangers.
Battalions of strangers... Battalions of strangers.
...Out.

Don't ya worry if you're lonely baby

I used to see in black and white
Never something in between
Waitin' on the love of my life
To come into my dreams
Everything in shades of gray
Never any blues or greens
I needed someone else to turn to
Someone who could help me learn to see
All the beauty that was waiting for me
You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
The silver lining in my prayers
And now there's color everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's color everywhere
My life was so predictable
Never any mystery
But ever since you shined the light
All of that is history
Now I have a hand to hold
And a reason to believe
There's someone in my life worth living for
I was hanging 'round just wishin' on a star
To put the happiness back in my heart and
You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
The silver lining in my prayers
And now there's color everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's color everywhere
I left those hazy days behind me
Never to return again
Now they're just a faded memory
'Cause baby it's all so clear to see
The beauty that was waiting for me
You, you put the blue back in the sky
You put the rainbow in my eyes
The silver lining in my prayers
And now there's color everywhere
You put the red back in the rose
Just when I needed it the most
You came along to show you care
And now there's color everywhere
You care and now there's color everywhere
There's color everywhere
There's color everywhere

Visualise winning
It's all in the mind
If your head is spinning
Find a way to make it fly
I can really feel your pain
It eats into my soul
We can make this together
You must never surrender
This is now or never
Close your eyes and visualise
Visualise swimming
In the oceans, in the sky
Go back to the beginning
To the place where you can fly
Whole lives can get crystallized
In moments like this
We can make this together
You must never surrender
This is now or never
Close your eyes and visualise
Oh
I visualise happiness
A thousand words I can't express
I visualise happiness
A part of me won't be suppressed
I visualise laughing hard
And open up a deck of cards
Singing 'til the day is through
I make a call, I know it's you
We can make this together
You must never surrender
This is now or never
Close your eyes and visualise
And visualise

Yesterday in parliament
You got the honourable this
The honourable that, and
Nothin' so eloquent
As a little bit of mis-
Understanding, and a lot of chat
Something you wanna say?
Don't address it to me
You gotta see your MP
He's gonna to take up your case today
Do civilised people always act this way?
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha.
Oh yesterday in parliament
We got shoutin' down the front
And shoutin' up the back an'
Come on gentlemen, settle down at the front
Sit down at the back
' There's something you wanna say?
Well address it to the House in the usual way
I know you want to have some fun
But civilised people ought to get things done.
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha.
Blame Jesus for all the trouble in the world today
Blame anybody you like
But don't blame the government of the day.
Oh yesterday in parliament
We got rhetoric elective, a little bit of cynicism
Nothing heaven sent
Just a mere hint of socialism, lotta conservatism
' Nothing I wanna say
To make any changes let's keep it this way
There's nowhere I wanna go
I'm enjoying my breakfast and this radio show.
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha.
INSTRUMENTAL
There's nothing I wanna say
To make any changes let's keep it this way
There's nowhere else I wanna go
I'm enjoying my breakfast and this radio show.
Ha ha , ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
da da da, da da da da da
da da da, da da da da
da da da, da da da da da
(and fade).

Think of all the hearts
Beating in the world
At the same time
Think of all the faces
And the stories they could tell
At the same time
Think of all the eyes
Looking out into this world
Trying to make some sense of what we see
Think of all the ways we have of seeing
Think of all the ways there are of being
Think of all the children
Being born into this world
At the same time
Feel your love surround them
Through the years they'll need to grow
At the same time
Just think of all the hands
That will be reaching for a dream
Think of all the dreams that could come true
Yes if the hands we're reaching with
Could come together
Joining me and you
When it comes to thinking of tomorrow
We must protect our fragile destiny
In this prescious life there's no time to borrow
The time has come to be a family
Ohhh...
Think of all the love
Pouring from our hearts
At the same time
Yes think of all the light our looks
Can shine and grow this world
At the same time
At the same time
Yes think what we've been givin
And yet think what we could lose
All of life is in our trembling hands
It's time to overcome our fears
And join to build a world that loves and understands
It helps to think of all the hearts
Beating in the world
And hope for all the hearts
Healing in the world
There's a healing music in our hearts
Beating in this world
At the same time
At the same time

I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can't let go
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes
I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you
And if I can't find my way
If salvation seems worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

Reaching out
Don't know what you'll find
Always reaching out
Hoping you'll find love
'Cause when it comes
You'll hold on tight
But wonder will it ever survive
How long will it take
For love to stand by you?
[Bridge]
'Cause everybody needs
Someone to love
And everybody needs
Someone they can trust and know
[Chorus]
'Cause people may come
And people will go away
They can cause you disappointment and pain
They come as your friend
Though some in the end
They can leave you disappointed
You're in doubt
You've been down that road
Met many people
Who have left you cold
They pretend they're on your side
But soon draw their knives
Gotta learn to figure out
Just who's right and wrong for you
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Gotta learn to read the signs
Gotta learn who's wrong from right
Gotta learn who is your friend
And will be there to the end for you
Gotta learn to live your life
Gotta learn to walk with pride
Gotta keep that in your mind
Gotta know deep down inside who's true
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Say, what you wanna need to say
Just hide away
I'm sick of remaining in walls that are just made of smoke
Your lies and the fake
Let's go in vain while you're the only one who falls
How can you just be so proud?
When all you did was tell all those lies
But you're doing wrong this time
I know who you are
'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it
Shame, that you're always the same
To all your friends
That you are ready to sell them out, anytime
To save your own face
Now can't you see that you're a new self in my size
How can you just be so proud?
When all you did was tell all those lies
But you're doing wrong this time
I know who you are
I've seen, so many times
The way you try to bring me down
You're made of proportionate mind
But it's time to shake the lies
Shake the lies
'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it
It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down
It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down
Let me try, let me fight
Take a breath now is the time
Rise and fall, take it all
Breaking down all of these walls
Let me try, let me fight
Let me do this one more time
Rise and fall, take it all
Breaking down all of these walls
My heart, it's like I'm being denied
You unjudge me
'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it
It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down
It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you
Ears closed, what I hear no one else has to know
'Cause I know in that what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you, smash into you
Head down, as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
I should, I'm in love and I'm racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
Oh, I wanna run, smash into you
I'm willing to run, smash into you
I'm willing to run and run, and run, and run, ooh
I'm ready to run and run, and run, and run, ooh
And I wanna run, run, smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, smash into you

What can I do to make light
Of this dull dull day
What switch can I pull
To illuminate the way
Show me one direction
I will not question again
For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain
We all need a love
(resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love
(resurrection just a little divine intervention)
What seed must I sow
To replenish this barren land
Teach me to harvest,
I want you to grow in my hand
Let's be optimistic,
Let's say that we won't toil in vain
If we pull together
We'll never fall apart again
We all need a love
(resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love
(resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We need love
Resurrection
(we need a little love)
We need a divine (intervention)
Show me one direction
I will not question again
For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain
We all need a love
(resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love
(resurrection just a little divine intervention)
We need love
Resurrection
We need love
(we need a love resurrection)
(just a little divine intervention)

You don't know how
You don't know how good it can be
In the cold
In the cold light of day
You don't know
And you don't care
You don't want no
Together again
Hard to be around
Hard for me to care
Trouble will get you down
Trouble will get you down again and again
You don't know why
You don't know why, where or when
Hard to be around
Hard for me to care

Somebody joined
Somebody drowned
When lady Jesus come to town
She made the calls, she made it fall
In a "gruesome vibe" never seen before
Somebody joined
Somebody drowned
Who's gonna care for a blinded fool?
Who's gonna save this blinded fool?
Watch out everyone, here she comes,
Claiming like she's the chosen one
Who's gonna save this blinded fool?
This is it, a money pit
I sense a fear of mother wit
Disguise
Smokey eyes
How come she don't take advice?
Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Hey you
Hiding away
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Big fool
Digging a grave
Forever on the outside never getting inside
Walk the streets of my city/silly hood?
A silly sense of love and youth
What is left of an empty space
Is society screaming for a better day
Walk the streets of my city/silly hood
This is it, a money pit
A sense of fear of mother wit
Disguise
Smokey eyes
How come she don?t take advice

Daytime friends and nighttime fools
Oh, they're breaking golden rules
Dreaming all their dreams come true
Dreaming like the big guys do
From a day in paradise
And a life without a lie
Little dreams can go a long, long way
Don't stop this Hollywood nights
Stand up and fight
Ohoho, ohoho
Hollywood nights
Don't stop this Hollywood nights
Know that it's right
Ohohoh, ohoho
Hollywood nights
Dreams are more than a little wish
Broken promises maybe you're reach
There's a will and there's a way
You'll bear the pain another day
You can make it, if you try
Don't give it up
Oh baby, why?
Little dreams can go a long, long way

I hold you close right to my heart
Plus from the past that sets you apart
From all the rest, you are the best
Come here, come on, give me a kiss
Remember all the fun times we shared
Anticipating good times ahead
Spending time with you, its true
Theres nothing that Id rather do
Theres a million different ways to say I love you
Theres a million different ways to say I care for you
Theres a million ways to say I need you too
Theres a million different ways
A million different ways to say
I like the way you satisfy me
I like the way you lectrify me
You cant ignore, I cant explain
I know well learn from every change
You make me laugh, You make me see me
Falling in love with you, its a dream
I close me eyes, youre standing there
With a smile that says you care
Theres a million different ways to say I love you
Theres a million different ways to say I care for you
Theres a million ways to say I need you too
Theres a million different ways
A million different ways to say
Happy just to be here with you
I dont know what I would do
Without your love, without a clue
You bring out the best, its true
I can see you understand me
My best friend, my cup of tea
Dont ever change the way you are
We fit just like a hand in
Theres a million different ways to say I love you
Theres a million different ways to say I care for you
Theres a million ways to say I need you too
Theres a million different ways
A million different ways to say
I love you, baby

Sea of sin
I'm swimming in
And I'm taking a dive
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it keeps me alive
It gets better and better
As it gets wetter and wetter
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
But I don't care
Sea of sin
Through thick and thin
For better or worse
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper
As we sink deeper and deeper
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there
Here under God's sky
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize
Sea of sin
My second skin
My home from home
When I'm in doubt
My hands reach out
And I'm never alone
It gets wetter and wetter
As it gets better and better
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I'm prepared
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
Yes I'm aware
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I don't care
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I don't care

Alone in the world was poor little Anne
As sweet a young child as you'd find
Her parents had gone to their final reward
Leaving their baby behind
Did you hear this poor little child
Was only nine years of age
When mother and dad went away
Still she bravely worked
At the one thing she knew
To earn a few pennies a day
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Fashioned from Annie's despair
With papers and shears, with wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum
As snow flakes drifted in to her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb
From artificial flowers, those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair
And they found little Annie all covered with ice
Still clutching her poor frozen shears
Amidst all the blossoms, she had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears
There must be a Heaven where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers
And instead of halo, she'll wear round her head
A garland of genuine flowers
No more artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of society to wear
Those artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Fashioned from Annie's
Fashioned from Annie's despair

Lover of mine
Gone to a faraway land
Serving your country
On some faraway sand
But you should get no name
Remember that your heart belongs to me
I'm sending you a picture
To carry with you all the time
So when you're feeling lonely
It's something to remind you
I'm thinking of you constantly
Remember that your hearts belongs to me
Your heart belongs to me
If a pretty girl should pass you by
I won't mind
If you give her the eye
Or even if you give her a smile sometimes
But keep your heart
Because your heart is mine
Your heart is mine
Your heart is mine
Lover of mine
If I could tell you how I yearn
For the day to come
When you will return
From far across the sea
So remember that your heart belongs to me
Remember your heart belongs to me
Far across the sea

[Verse 1]
Rearrange,
You've changed the way
That I love and the way
That I live my life
Like springtime now
Every day that I wake
Ain't the same
As it was before
[Bridge]
I feel so safe,
Here in your arms
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Keep my heart right
Here safe from harm
Don't ever take your love
From me
[Chorus]
Your touch reminds me of
Why I keep holding
On to love
And your kiss is the reason
That I know
I'll keep holding on to love
[Verse 2]
It's crazy how you just came
In my life, right on time
When I needed you most
Addictive, whatever
You gave to me
Is too strong
For me to let go
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Your touch reminds me
Of our love
Your kiss is the reason
That I'm so strong
[Chorus]
[Verse 1]

Will you take me back again
You know I'd take you back again
Open up your heart again
You know I'd give up my heart again
Everybody makes mistakes
Well nobody, nobody's perfect
I know that I've made mistakes
Well nobody, nobody's perfect
So will you meet me in the middle of the fire escape
If it's not too late
We'll get out of the ashes
Why do we have to wait
We'll get out of the ashes
You never meant a word you said
I never meant a word I said
We're hurting from the inside out
And from the outside in
Everybody needs a break
You know and I know we're worth it
Just a little give and take
Well you know and I know we're worth it
So if you meet me in the middle of the fire escape
If it's not too late

In the event of something happening to me,
There is something I would like you all to see.
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew.
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound.
Maybe someone is digging underground,
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed,
Thinking those who once existed must be dead.
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.
In the event of something happening to me,
There is something I would like you all to see.
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew.
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.

Watch what you say to that girl that I love
You best be true or I'll be seeing you
Don't tell her lies , say things to make her cry
I , I'll be there so you best beware
I love that girl, she is the girl
For her I would die
Don't fool around or I'll break you down if you try
You gotta watch what you say
Don't you dare hurt my love
I, I'm still the one
And I'll be here when you're gone
(break)
I love that girl , she is the girl
For her I would die
Don't fool around or I'll break you down if you try
You gotta watch what you say
Don't you dare hurt my love
I , I'm still the one
And I'll be here when you're gone
Oh,oh,oh,oh

When a cowboy loves a cowgirl
They attract together
But when a forcefield breaks them apart
They won't survive forever
It's like "It's over", We're done", "Forget about me"
It's like "My first boy friend already dumped me"
That's hillbilly love
That's country you see
Let's pretend that couple
Was You and Me
But then we broke up
It's not pretty like a dove
And that's hillbilly love
At our first wedding
You took the flowers from the vase
You hit me with those flowers
And I hit you with your case
It's like "I don't", It's over", "I was wrong"
The relationship is why I'm writing this song
That's hillbilly love
That's country you see
Let's pretend that couple
Was You and Me
But then we broke up
It's not pretty like a dove
Hillbilly love
It's a country thing
When I write a song for you,
I gotta sing
But when we break up
It's not pretty like a dove
And that's hillbilly love
It's like "I don't wanna be with you"
It's like "We're done and over this time"
It's like "We don't have nothing in common"
It's like Uh... I ran out of rhymes
That's hillbilly love
That's country you see
Let's pretend that couple
Was You and Me
But then we broke up
It's not pretty like a dove
Hillbilly love
It's a country thing
When I write a song for you,
I gotta sing
But when we break up
It's not pretty like a dove
And that's hillbilly love
Hillbilly Love
Hillbilly Love

It's not you it's not me
It's a feeling now and then
To your face I find it hard to say
A word about your ways that's ok
Your smile the bravest face of all
Look your eyes they try to pin me down
Save me from myself
I won't see your smile the bravest face of all
I don't care for it at all
Warmth and smiles as we follow this old game
and we're looking through windows the colour of wine
and second by second they close leaving me behind

Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me workin' day and night
Just tryin' to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
And thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die
Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman

The super fly guy that you're courtin' now
Used to be a super-swot
And the clothes he thinks look retro
Are more 'Land That Time Forgot'
And if he knows where he was standin'
When J.F.K was shot
Chances are though time's passed him by
He's still standing within yards of that spot
So if your hangover feels like the dart board
Whilst the Christians hit bulls-eye
And paranoia that self-employer
Is following in heavy disguise
Off goes intelligence to join high tide
To drift with all the things we let go
Only tidal wave could possibly save
All we let go with the flow
Let go with the flow
Books we may have written, we don't know
Let go with the flow
Some enchanted city we won't go
He who used to float like a butterfly once
Is floatin' like a glorious moth
And the fly girls you hung around with then
Are lucky if they even take off
Dresses and skirts you thought were in
Everyone a dust-rag or dishcloth
Like every flat beer that they serve around here
We all start life as fabulous froth
So why do you work yourself that hard
When you don't even like the job?
Why do you hate the small-time thief
When it's your own time, you'll always rob?
Off goes intelligence to join high tide
To drift with all the things we let go
Only tidal wave could possibly save
All we let go with the flow
Let go with the flow
Books we may have written, we don't know
Let go with the flow
Some enchanted city we won't go
Let go with the flow
Books we may have written, we don't know
Let go with the flow
Some enchanted city we won't go

Baby, baby
Baby you're the one
Keeping me awake baby all night long
Looking it over
Thinking about all the times we've spent together
Don't worry about it
'Cause the feelings I have no longer seem to be with me
The morning moved on to the night today's away
Falling apart 'cause the night can't take the grey
The way that you are
The look in your eyes
Feels like my world is coming together
The way that you smile
Just for a while
I know it took sometime to discover
You're the only one
Baby, baby
Baby you're the one
Keeping me awake baby all night long
Made it through the bad times
Cried all my tears have to move on with my life now
Know that I will be strong
Now you'll always be mine never one to say goodbye
The morning moved on to the night today's away
Falling apart 'cause the night can't take the grey
The way that you are
The look in your eyes
Feels like my world is coming together
The way that you smile
Just for a while
I know it took sometime to discover
You're the only one
Baby, baby
Baby you're the one
Keeping me awake baby all night long
No more heartache to get me down
No more sadness to be yeah
No more waiting till you come round
You know that you're the only one for me
For reasons maybe only I can see
Yeah
The way that you are
The look in your eyes
Feels like my world is coming together
The way that you smile
Just for a while
I know it took sometime to discover
From one broken heart to another
You're the only one
Baby, baby
Baby you're the one
Keeping me awake baby all night long
Baby, baby
Baby you're the one
Keeping me awake baby all night long

One, two, three
Counting out the signs we see
The tall buildings
Fading in the distance
Only dots on a map
Four, five, six
The two of us a perfect fit
You're all mine, all mine
And all I can say
Is you blow me away
Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
But you picked me
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
But you picked me
Yeah you picked me
So softly
Rain against the windows
And the strong coffee
Warming up my fingers
In this fisherman's house
You got me
Searched the sand
And climbed the tree
And brought me back down
And all I can say
Is you blow me away
Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
But you picked me
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
But you picked me
Yeah you picked me

How I'd let him come back
How I'd let him come back
She wants ya, I need ya
Please tell me to stay
She says that she loves ya like I love ya
But you know that it ain't the same
We had a fling
This I know
But now we got a thing...

Kiss me baby I am snow white sleeping in a coffin
Waiting for you - waiting for magic
Baby I am snow white sleeping in a coffin
Waiting for you - waiting for magic
A man of the world but lost in a dream
You look at something from a different angle
But I exist I'm waiting for you
In a coffin made of glass
Kiss me baby I'm attractive
Baby get to know me
Show who you are
Give me that magic
Baby I'm eternal
Lying in a coffin
Waiting for you
In your dream a girl is dancing close to you (that girl is me)
Once a witch made her sleep but a prince will wake her up that's you
Kiss me baby
In the tale is the place to find her
Reach out to get to know her
It means so much to me
The meaning of the book
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up
Join the story of the fairytale
Believe the dream you will not fail
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up
Kiss me baby
Waiting for magic it's what I do
Waiting for magic for me and you
Oh, kiss me baby wake me up
Caught in a dream how lucky you are
You can see me I'm the girl behind you
So open your eyes and turn around
And watch me dancing join the fairy tales
Kiss me baby
You cannot reach her on the planet
That scientist want to call earth
But if you use your imagination
You will see her
You will find her in your dreams
I see no shadows in my dreams
It is something so romantic
I can tell it's for real you'll see

Who needs a captain on a love ship?
Someone with no clue of the destination due bow
Ain't that a trip?
Who needs a diamond on a hand of stone?
Someone with the hurt who couldn't make it work,
A trophy because you slipped
Love can't conquer anything
If it's lost without a trace
You might be tough, you might even be strong
But not when you're in this place
Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it's just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
Who needs a journey on a runaway train?
Your ticket isn't worth half of what it hurts
When heart beats overwork
Who needs redemption from a guiltless crime?
Someone caries dreams from scene to scene
'Til they tear apart your mind
Love can't conquer anything
If it's hurting in the deep
You'll be awake, you'll twist your fate
That's not someone you should keep
Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it's just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine
This is their demand for another night they spend in self-conversation
It's a will they came to pose in a letter left they've composed
To repeat the situation
They lie in a loop
Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it's just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

I thought that this was something (yes)
Promising that one day
It would turn into something (yes)
I thought the feelings were mutual
And I didn't have to guess
Started being skeptical
Always unavailable
Like you didn't know
But now I'm feeling something (yes)
It's telling me this may not be
The real something (yes)
But you was showing me
Now I'm ready and you running
Damn you got me open now
Feeling like I'm choking now
Where am I to go
I can't
Believe that you can feel my heart
And I can't
Believe you'd let me fall so hard
Stop playing
How could you let it go this far
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
And you said
That you're the type to take it slow
And you said
Before I step I'll let you know
Stop playing
Before you let me see you with her
You could have told me to change was going
To come
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Or put it on me hard like you use to do
I feel in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seeing her falling for your charm
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough
See I know we not official (no)
But us being official ain't never been an issue
It came down to us
Boy remember we were different
We said that we'd talk
If we ever had problems about anything
I was cool with no commitment (wait)
Let me take that back
It was you so I was with it (see)
Guess I didn't get
When you showed you didn't miss it
Now it seems that your interest ain't here
And we ain't the same
I can't
Believe that you can feel my heart
And I can't
Believe you'd let me fall so hard
Stop playing
How could you let it go this far
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
And you said
That you're the type to take it slow
And you said
Before I step I'll let you know
Stop playing
Before you let me see you with her
You could have told me to change was going
To come
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Or put it on me hard like you use to do
I know in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seeing her falling for your charm
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough
All you had to say was this ain't what you want
I wouldn't be so hurt and I could just move on
You had me believing, everything was my fault
But I can see now
It's a situation that I must let go
'Cause you ain't going to be a man and let me know
I guess me seeing you with her
Says it all
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Or put it on me hard like you use to do
I know in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seeing her falling for your charm
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Or put it on me hard like you use to do
I know in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls could't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seeing her falling for your charm
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough

No one wrote a song for me
Just instrumental not too long
As sure as sure could ever be
You'd only get the lyrics wrong
No solo Chet Baker ever played
lowered me slowly to my grave
The prose that Keats and Yates would save
was for King and Queen not knave
I have no poem that describes my charm
No story told that's short and sweet
I have no hymn, I have no psalm
This song I have it has no beat
Yes it has no beat
No tapping of feet
Yes it has no beat
Miles Davis played the black 'n' blues
Did he play for me to lose?
Cause just when round midnight falls
That tune's not his it's Kenny Ball's
Now on that graveyard on that grave
On that tombstone in the shade
No poem written, no accolade
No "We loved you" ever sprayed
There's just this feeling from that moss
When epitaph you cannot read
he must have lived it at budget cost
So he deserves to be beneath
All that William Robinson wrote
not one of my pluses did he portray
those lyrics stuck right down my throat
I never hit
It never hit
My hit parade

the walk that walks
and takes me forever
leads me down the road to nothing
the shoes that take me don't matter
and I've been walking forever
you could wear fancy clothes
you could hope that I wear your rose
but inside I know what's true
and baby it's not you
the walk that I've been walking forever
to make sure no one finds me ever
I could wear pretty clothes
and I could wear your rose
but inside you know the truth
you know... I'm not like you

I was dreamin' about a time I've waited for
Christ was coming on his way
On his way to take us home
All of my friends stood and watched as I went by
I never told them the reason Jesus had to die
Just then I awoke to see-oppurtunity
(CHORUS)
If you love someone, if you love somebody
Let it show, let them know of the fathers love
Tell them of his glory; let them know
Conversation-You say so much but nothings said
Confrontation-What's going on inside their head?
Hesitation-There's no easy way to start
Determination-Just let the Lord speak through your heart
Don't pass up opportunity-set them free!
(CHORUS)

I know you think I'm terrifying
But honey I ain't even trying
I'll cook your dinner while your waiting
I'm sure you'll find it's fascinating
Hey little dog don't you know, I got a feeling that your waiting for your tin of gold
Oh yeah, baby, baby don't you know, you don't need money if you really wanna loose control
I believe there's a god, making my time, baking my bread
I can see it's a sign think of a rhyme shaking my head
Oh, I believe there's a god, making my time, baking my bread
I can see it's a sign think of a rhyme shaking my head
I know you think I'm terrifying
But honey I ain't even trying
I'll cook your dinner while your waiting
I'm sure you'll find it's fascinating
God bless this stubborn soul she cried
He lived a lonely life and died
[Repeat: x2]
Hey little dog don't you know, I got a feeling that your waiting for your tin of gold
Oh yeah, baby, baby don't you know, you don't need money if you really wanna loose control

I trapped a spider underneath a glass,
I kept it for a week to see how long he'd last,
He stared right back at me,
He thought that he could win,
We played a waiting game,
He thought that I'd give in,
England made me,
England made me,
I had a dream last night that I was drunk,
I killed a stranger and left him in a trunk,
At Brighton railway station,
It was an unsolved case,
A famous murder mystery,
People love a mystery,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
I need my privacy,
I lead a secret life,
Sleep with the enemy then betray both sides,
I traveled all my life,
But never got away from the killing job,
And the garden shed,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,

You know
This is not just another song to me
I've been through this struggle
And I've been through the years
Man (Konvict)
It's a long way up
Oh (The story of my life
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
(I'm ready and nothing's gonna stop me)
The cash might not
Flow, got no
Dough
Give it just a second
Then it just might grow
(Stop) Work hard
Play my cards
If I'm going to reach
Up for the stars
Never fail
Unless you quit
Listen to your heart and just
Stick with it
If it is to be
It is up to me
Take two little words
That will talk to me
I don't know how
Know how to quit
If you put ya mind to it
You can do it
All ya gotta do is pursue it
I don't know how
Know how to quit
If ya put ya mind to it
You can do it
All ya gotta do is pursue it
I'm a hustle man
Hustle to the day I die
I'm a hustle man
If ya don't give love
No I won't cry
I'm a hustle man
Cause I've worked so hard
And it's my time
I'm a hustle man
It's my time to shine
So stick to the fight
When your heart is hit
And things seem worse
But you musn't quit
People try to put you down
Sayin' you can't do it,
Take a hike, get outta town
But I know deep in my soul
I've trumped this
I was made for this, yeah
I don't know how
Know how to quit
If you put ya mind to it
You can do it
All ya gotta do is pursue it
I don't know how
Know how to quit
If ya put ya mind to it
You can do it
All ya gotta do is pursue it
I'm a hustle man
Hustle to the day I die
I'm a hustle man
If ya don't give love
No I won't cry
I'm a hustle man
Cause I've worked so hard
And it's my time
I'm a hustle man
It's my time to shine
I'm a hustle man
Hustle to the day I die
I'm a hustle man
If ya don't give love
No I won't cry
I'm a hustle man
Cause I've worked so hard
And it's my time
I'm a hustle man
It's my time to shine
Remember
Quitters never win
And winners never quit
So what are you?
Yeah

Woo ooh
Yeah ah
My head's full of thought
Thoughts of you
And I'm distracted so easy
Thinking what to do
So unsure, so unfamiliar
Am I wrong to think that something could happen
Will you fall for me
I need to know, the way I'd like you to
Baby, will you fall for me
The way I've fallen for you
I'm not like myself
And I'm playing the role of someone else
And my hearts beating so fast
I can't stop it
And I'm so unsure
So unfamiliar
Am I wrong to think that something could happen
Will you fall for me
The way I'd like you to
Will you fall for me
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you
Fallen for, fallen for you
For you
So unsure, so unfamiliar
Am I wrong to think,
That something could happen
Was I wrong to think I
Will you fall for me
The way I'd like you to
Will you fall for me
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you
The way I've fallen for you

I remember you down by the river
We made love in the dead of winter
And those crows and fields
Yeah we set them all on fire
But there was nothing left
When we were done, no nothing left, oh
And do you ever think about me
'Cause I think about you all the time?
We burn so bright, we tore all through the night
And sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?
There was danger and wonder in your eyes
But you felt as free as the big blue sky
And sometimes when the cold night comes
You blow into my mind
And you want my bones all like brand new wine
Just like brandy wine, yeah
Do you ever think about me
'Cause I think about you all the time?
We burn so bright, we tore all through the night
Sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?
There's a place where those young lovers are still together
We ran away to a world past forever, oh oh, yeah
Do you ever think about me
'Cause I think about you all the time?
We burn so bright that we tore all through the night
Sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
You're always on my mind all the time
We burn so bright that we tore all through the night
Sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I think about you
Do you think about, do you think about me?

Agnetha, Frida Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plain
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance
Guess I've been working a little to hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii
It's so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

Do you like my mind
Do you even care
If there's anyone up there (yeah,yeah,yeah)

Piggy's on the floor getting some sun
The axe on the wall isn't the only one
The case in the hall, show to everyone
The lock on the door
If you wanna, if you oughta
If you kinda, shoulda, sorta
If you'd like some, if you'd try some
So you're sure before you buy some
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
The train will pass the loft each night at ten
Phone echoes round the loft at six am
People come and leave the loft every now and then
I love the loft
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
Gotta come to terms with what I've found
I'll be around
I'll be around
I'll be around
I'll be around

You try to be a mystery
With all your eccentricities
Every move is so surreal
You can't touch what you really feel
I see a deeper side
More than you know
Don't even try to hide
I've been everywhere you go
All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world
Break away the chains
Set you free
With everything that I can give to you
Wrap my arms around your world
You try to push the truth away
With all your witty repartee
A psychedelic romeo
Who thinks and does it all for show
I see myself in you
I know we're both afraid
There is an emptiness
Behind our masquerade
All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world
All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world

Sing us a song about Jesus
Jesus of long ago
Sing us a song about Jesus
He loves us you know.
To Bethlehem came three wise men
With gold and frankincense and myrrh
The journeyed far, by guiding star
To find the King of all the world.
In a manger he was born
In a manger he was born.
Shepherds in the fields nearby
Saw the Angels in the sky
And they all came down to welcome Him
On that night in Bethlehem.
Sing us a song about Jesus
Jesus of long ago
Sing us a song about Jesus
He loves us you know.
In Galilee He grew to be
Healer of the sick and blind
He spoke of love in Heaven above
And people came from miles to find
Jesus Christ the son of God
Jesus Christ the son of God.
He was a man who could be strong
Doer of good and righter of wrong
And he was gentle, kind and true
All the things that we could be too.
Sing us a song about Jesus
Jesus of long ago
Sing us a song about Jesus
He loves us you know.
Sing us a song about Jesus
Jesus of long ago
Sing us a song about Jesus
He loves us you know.
(Repeat and fade).

(Verse 1):
From the looks outside
I'll be the sweetest thing you ever knew (ahh yeah)
So when I send a smile
Bat my eyes, just to flirt with you (yeah but)
Just wait 'til we're alone and the lights go out
I have some things I wanna try, it's going down
Forget my first impression, baby it's a front
I'm more than a good look
I'll be everything you want
(Breakdown):
'Cause no one knows about me
They can't talk about me (yeah)
But if I open up to you, you won't forget about me
I keep a air of mystery
You can dream about me
I know what you're looking for
And that's what I'll be
(Chorus, 4x):
I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your
I'll be your lady in the street
And your freak in the bed
(Verse 2):
Flashbacks from last time
Calling you throughout the day (ahhh ahhh)
Just when you thought it was over
I ask you to do it another (another) another way
Shower scene in the morning then head off to work
By lunch you calling, boy just say the word
Out in public, I'll give you the sign
But no one else will know what's going on with you and I
(Breakdown)
(Chorus,ad libs)
(Bridge):
Handle my business whether day or night (yeah ahhh)
I'll wait until the time and place is right
When I let go, don't be surprised
I'm going all the way so come on for the ride, yeah
Handle my business whether day or night
I'll wait until the time and place is right
When I let go, don't be surprised
I'm going all the way, so come on (on)
(Chorus)

If only you,
Look where we are falling apart,
And nothing seems to mend,
This state of you, this state of me, mmh
Who do you think you're fooling now?
I guess we never find it out.
Who do you think you're fooling now, now?
If only you, if only you, could see that I?m burning,
If only you, would know how I?m hurting
All for you, if only you
I guess it's alright I keep my head high,
You never see me cry,
Confused over you, bad by me, yeah
Who do you think you're fooling now?
I guess we never find it out.
Who do you think you're fooling now, now?
If only you, if only you,
Could see that I?m burning (burning, baby) if only you,
Would know how I?m hurting, all for you, If only you
If only you, would know me better,
If only you would listen better,
If only you would see me better,
If only you would hear me better,
Set me free, before you press delete
If only you, could see that I?m burning,
If only you would know how I?m hurting, all for you.
If only you-you-you
(Baby if only you), if only you

Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why
From me
Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the
State line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must've known
What we were going to find
This ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancin' without the sound
It ain't nothin' no nothin'
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're gonna climb
Pat on the back and better luck next time
It ain't nothin' no it ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town
Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen 'em rise
I've seen 'em fall
Some get nothin'
And lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawled away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm, I'm gonna need you
Down this yellow brick road

Leading with my heart again
I'm leading with my heart again
I don't know if I'll lose or win
But I'm leading with my heart again
Putting my mind on hold
Yeah, I'm putting my mind on hold
I could be risking my very soul
But I'm putting my mind on hold
Yeah, I must admit
There's just something about your kiss
An' I can't explain
Wouldn't want to if I could anyway
I'm leaping before I look
Yeah, I'm leaping before I look
It may not be the same chance you took
But I'm leaping before I look
Walking before I crawl (Walking before you crawl)
Yeah, I'm walking before I crawl. (Walking before)
I might tumble, I might fall
But I'm walking before I crawl
I know it's dangerous
I know it's foolish
But thinking it over
You can't make me do it
Yeah, I must admit
There's just something about your kiss
An' I can't explain
Wouldn't want to if I could anyway
Leading with my heart again
Yeah, I'm leading with my heart again
I don't know if I'll lose or win
But I'm leading with my heart
I'm leading with my heart again
Yeah, yeah
Leading with my heart again
It doesn't really matter at all

TRANSLATION:
In the middle of these woods, there's a clown of circus at the bottom
It always watch everyone and tries to make them laugh
No matter what time if you're sad nor happy
I will try to please everyone
The truth is you must be concerned about this strange red nose I have
If you teased me, it will never change
I just laughed when I fell down from dancing
and because I stumbled, I also cried
Just I can't say it that it's dangerous
"I have to do it, who will do it!" but to you, you just laugh
I don't want something dangerous like tightrope
But, would you decide for me?
Cheer
"Do your best"
In fact, I know
that you have to practive
Even if you stumbled for many times
that you even got frustrated
Go do your best
just only your impatient feelings can be seen
I have seen it properly
that you're working hard
Inside this circus, there's some sleeping in their tents
But you have to remember the magic
So, I wont force it to you
only this night today
Just I can't say it that it's dangerous
"I have to do it, who will do it!" but to you, you just laugh
I don't want something dangerous like tightrope
But, would you decide for me?
Cheer
"Do your best"
Just I can't say it that it's dangerous
"I have to do it, who will do it!" but to you, you just laugh
Just I can't say it that it's dangerous
"I have to do it, who will do it!" but to you, you just laugh
I don't want something dangerous like tightrope
But, would you decide for me?
Cheer
"Do your best"

I mistook the warnings for wisdom
From so called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me otherwise
Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young
I was scared, I was wrong
Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home
Guess I did what I did believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore
Than never knowing
Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home, a home
Four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
Just a place to run when my working day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule I guess that's true
Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home, a home

We would go driving in the sun
Into a world where we were one
We'd close our eyes and we'd become
As free as the sun and moon that shone
And even when our love has gone
And time has moved us all along
And even when the shades have passed
And what we made has gone at last
Something goes on and on and on . . .
And though I know that things won't change
I remember all of our days
Beautiful in many ways . . .
Guess I was searching for someone
I guess I thought you were the one
Cos I so wanted to belong
But now I know that I was wrong
But I believe that there was love
That fell between the two of us
And I believe the time we had
Was meant to be, but not to last . . .
And though I know that things
won't change
I remember all our days
Beautiful in many ways . . .

Gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On pepper tree
Harden, harden, harden don'ts and won'ts
My easel she
You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden don'ts and won'ts
My easel touch
Gain his voice
On pepper tree
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she
You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden don'ts and won'ts
My easel touch
Gain his voice
On pepper tree
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she
You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden don'ts and won'ts
My easel touch

Here come those eyes
There goes my ability to breathe
Those legs are walking her to me
Well, tell me I ain't dreaming
Here comes that smile
I can't even move, can't even blink
'Cause I don't want to miss a thing
And I'm not even fooling
When I say the boys are drooling
And the girls are all staring her down
My knees go weak
And my heart starts to pound
It happens every time
She saunters into the room
It all blurs and it all starts to zoom
And then my head starts spinning
She gets a few feet away
And suddenly we're both in slow motion
Like were alone in the deep blue ocean
I know it's just a feeling
But it might as well be real
Because I think I might be fixin' to drown
My knees go weak
And my heart starts to pound
She takes my hand
I don't know what to say
She understands anyway
And here come those eyes
'Can she what I'm think of?'
If this is what they call love
I can't believe I'm in it
Thanking heaven every minute
I'm the luckiest boy in this town
My knees go weak and my heart stops
And I can't catch my breath
I think I better sit down
Because my knees go weak
And my heart starts to pound

Sometimes da game got me stressin' partner I can't lie

Smokin wit my Lawyer and my Dentist
Feelin' stupendous want to come to my quarter stacks
Smokin' on greener reef

Dun rolled a lax wit a high speed chasers ones dat couldn't church me
Cocked mouthed and thirsty gotta keep my spirit lifted though
My spiritual, lyrical, it's hydromyrical
I'm comin' vicious though, wit a fully loaded off dat durby
Feelin so worthy 'cause my vacuum lungs are like dat curby
And don't disturb me when I'm floatin' to my foreign land
You no fo' sho' I keep my pipe in my weed hand

Your weed hand throw it up and represent your weed
Sometimes da game got me stressin' partner I can't lie

Lit it up wit my nephew
And now I'm floatin'
My crown is broken
Soakin' up my soul
Sippen' styrofoam cups
Chokin' now I'm low
If you ridden on us dat's cool but pass da' joint
Diamonds flyin' and you just had to go
'Cuz you dun cast da vote
And I didn't even get a hit
No not even a little bit
So now help me get rid of dis
Baby girl don't disrespect the luv

Whisper you love me boy
Say the words you seldom say
You love me more
Each passing day
Whisper you love me boy
Just the way you used to do
When our love was true
It's been so long
Since you held me in your arms
Ooh, the joy it brings
Hearing you say sweet things
Whisper you love me boy
Make it sound soft and dear
Tender and sincere
Whisper you love me boy
Say it in your sweet way
The things I seldom hear you say
You used to say
You love me the most
But now you hardly ever hold me close
Whisper you love me boy
Whisper, whisper

[T.I.]
Uh ya know what?
On the real
Uh
Me and you
We've been through
So much that we need to start off new
You need to choose
Don't be confused
I think it's time, time that you
Tell me the way that you want to be with me, or be with her
This whole ordeal is such a blur
See I was prepared to take a loss
But my heart won't pay the cost
You don't know where you want to be
[Chorus]
You don't have to take my advice
You don't have to compromise
Cause I know that you don't realize
You don't even see
Where you need to be
Be with them, all ya friends
Claim that the closeness is playin a lost end
I want a peace locket in seconds again
Do you want to play with me?
Or play with them?
Tell me where you want to be in love
Is that enough?
When all the problems start adding up
Ladies raise your hands if you've had enough
Scream as loud as you can if you've had enough
Cause he don't know where he wants to be
[Chorus]
[T.I.]
Why you say that baby?
It's all good show
Are you for real?
Common now
Don't talk like that
A, a
Hey I promise in all honesty
I honor you, you honor me
For better, worse, rich, or poor
Whatever it's gonna be
I'm talkin' bout forever more, for the rest of eternity
No need to be insecure
I know what I want to be
I know I made a lot of mistakes
But I can make em all (make em all)
Unless you got your heart set on breakin' hearts
If I can't see your face then my day ain't even worth wakin' up
Especially with these haters no put cases, this time enough
Maybe showin' you attention is something I haven't done enough
But you got all my love on all our love
Girl, I need you to believe in me
You need to know that I know where I need to be, a
[Chorus: x2]

You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're givin' it to some other guy who gives you the eye
You don't give nothin' to me, you painted a smile
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on
I know that it's wrong, but I can't stop this pain inside me
Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,
Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
But what can I do without you
You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using ev'ry trick in the book the way that you look
You're really something to see,
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy,
But don't you know I'm out of my mind, so give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me.
Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,
Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
But what can I do without you
Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,
Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
But what can I do
Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,
Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart

All the things I said,
I should have said and didn't say,
And I wonder why.
Yes, I wonder why.
I think about the time we spent,
The places that we went;
Still makes me cry.
Yes, it makes me cry.
Why do they say that time will heal
This broken heart?
They would know it isn't true
If they lost someone like you, oh.
[Chorus]
Some things can never be replaced.
Some things are with me for always.
These are the things I will remember
When I remember when.
I'd rather love and lose it all
Than never have you to recall.
These are the things I will remember.
Again and then again,
(Again and again.)
When I remember when.
You taught me how to love.
I am all I am
Because of you.
Just because of you.
Everytime I lost my way,
You shine a light, you made my day,
You see me through.
Yes, you see me through.
So who's gonna come around to heal
This broken heart?
Show me how to laugh and cry,
But never how to say goodbye.
[Chorus]
This life goes on, you carry on.
You do, and it's okay.
(When I remember when.)
This love goes on, and I will live
To love another day.
(Again and then again.)
This life goes on, you carry on.
You do, and it's okay.
I would laugh, and I would cry,
But I will never say goodbye.
[Chorus]
Oh,
When I remember when.

Crooked man down a crooked mile
Crooked backbone, crossed out smile
Crooked cat, crooked mouse
We live together in a crooked little house
We're all fine, we're all fine
We fit together like worms on a line
We're so good, we're so nice
We stick together like dirty horse flies
Crooked eyes, crooked tooth
Crooked mind bending back the truth
A crooked road on a crooked town
Looking down at the crumbs on the ground
We're all fine, we're all fine
We fit together like nickles on a dime
We're so good, we're so nice
We talk the mumbo jumbo Greenwich Mean Time

Everything has its season
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme
Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky
Every man his daydreams
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of
Sticking to the soul
Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all
So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn
Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble,
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)
Oh, I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky

I am the final silence
The last electrician alive
And they called me the sparkle
I was the best, I worked them all
New ways, new ways
I dream of wires
We opened doors by thinking
We went to sleep by dialing 'o'
We drove to work by proxy
I plugged my wife in, just for show
New ways, new ways
I dream of wires

(So hard, so hard to forget, no one ever did it better
I've been missing you, yes you are)
So hard, so hard to forget
Your love (so easy to love)
I never said I had all the answers
I'm not looking to place the blame
Don't matter who's right or wrong
It's just not the same since you've been gone
(Ooh) baby you (no one ever no one ever did)
No one ever did it better than you
(No one ever did it better) and I guess
That's just what makes you so hard
(So hard) So hard to forget
Since the day you said goodbye I've been missing you
Yes you are so hard so hard to forget
But I've never found nobody so easy to love
Don't you think that the time together
Should be erased by the time apart
My friends they ask me, ask me where you've been
I just don't know where to start
I call another guy by your name, change your face for his
It's just not the same, I know I got to be strong (yes I must)
Yes I must go on (yes I must go on)
But I can't help it lovin' you baby, I can't help it
Ooh baby you (no one ever no one ever)
No one ever did it better than you ooh
I guess that's just what makes you so hard
(So hard) so hard to forget, since the day you said goodbye
I've been missing you
Yes you are so hard so hard to forget
But I never found nobody so easy to love (no one ever) Baby
(No one ever no one ever did it) (no one ever did it better)
(No one ever no one ever did, no one ever did it)
(Ooh ooh baby) no one ever no one ever, no one did it better
(Ooh ooh baby) (no one ever no one ever did)
(No one ever did it better ooh ooh baby)
(No one ever no one ever) (no one ever did it better)
Ooh baby you ooh ooh
No one ever did it better than you
And I guess that's just what makes you
So hard so hard to forget since the day you said goodbye
I've been missing you missing you (yes you are)
So hard so hard to forget
That I've never had nobody so easy to love
(So hard) so hard to forget, I've been missing you wanting you
We should be together (yes you are) we should be together (so hard)
We should be together (so hard to forget) for ever (so easy to love)
Your love for me is all I need (so hard so hard to forget)
Baby baby baby (missing you yes you are)
Your love for me is all I need (so hard so hard to forget)
(So easy to love)

A little bit of ecstasy,
A little bit of you and me,
A little bit of set you free,
A little bit of ecstasy.
A little bit of ecstasy,
A little bit of you and me,
A little bit of set you free,
A little bit of ecstasy.
Give me what I want 'cause what I want is what you need,
Give me what I want a little bit of ecstasy
*Oo-ah, oh oh, oo-ah, oh oh
Give me what I want 'cause what I want is what you need,
Give me what I want a little bit of ecstasy
*Oo-ah, oh oh, oo-ah, oh oh

*De-de-de-da-doo ya, dede, dede dede
De-de-de-da-doo ya, (De-de-de-da-doo ya) (X. 4)
A little bit of ecstasy,
A little bit of you and me,
A little bit of set you free,
A little bit of ecstasy.
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you love me
I'll be your dr-eam
If you be my fantasy (X. 2)
I'll be your dream (X. 3)
I'll be your dr-ea-m
If you be my fantasy (Whoo Eee!) (X. 3)
(Ooo, oo yeah)
A little bit of ecstasy,
A little bit of you and me,
A little bit of set you free,
A little bit of ecstasy.
A little bit of ecstasy.

Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
I'll take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened
I'll make it disappear, dear
Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand
If you'll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
You squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This love's too overrated
See what's going on, on
Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand
If you'll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
Now I'm missing you
I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I'd put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I stopped eating food
And I squeezed into your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too

And you know you shouldn't have another cigarette but
Nothing else makes sense, nothing else will recompense
And you get your loneliness out of a magazine you never
Felt nothing at all no-one else will ever know another one
Has dragged you home and sworn that you're the only
One you dream they'll play a special part you'll write their
Name across your heart but then it's back inside your
Head the thought that it will turn out bad a fleeting
Glimpse of what is bound to be now the phone has lost
Its voice you're on your own again spend your time on
Endless bedroom floor soliloquies the only voices you'll
Hear all day will it always be this way (yes) once you
Recognize the truth that all is sad and you're the proof you
Might as well fight the day kick back at the pricks that say
All is school and work no more break your back it's not
Your war disengage the only way to win opened up my
Paintbox it had all turned to blue I worked in Birkenhead
For you it brings me tears even now you tried to kill me
Break my will you almost won I hate you still the hated
Suffer not what's worse the hater carries round the curse it
Eats me up the cancer that is you don't paint blue all the
Time know the truth read the signs live your life as a lie
You don't have to die

I close my eyes and picture
The emerald of the sea
From the fishin' boats at Dingle
To the shores at Dunehea
I miss the river Shannon
And the folks at Skibbereen
The meadows and the moorlands
And their forty shades of green
But most of all
I miss a girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her charms
And hair so long and brown
I long again to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green
I wish that I could spend an hour
At Dublin's churning surf
I long to watch the farmers
Drain the bogs and spade the turf
To see again the thatching
Of the straw the women clean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
Those forty shades of green
But most of all
I miss a girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her charms
And hair so long and brown
I long again to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

Bring me into the holy place
Jesus I want to see your face
To feel a tender spirit
Of mercy and of grace
Bring me into, into the holy place
Bring me into, into the holy place
Oh Lamb of God free my soul
To worship and adore
You are the one, the only Son
Breathe life into this one
Who seeks you now
Won't you let me know
The brightness of your throne
Your Spirit washes with fire
To purify this child
Bring me into the holy place
Jesus I want to see your face
To feel a tender spirit
Of mercy and of grace
Bring me into, into the holy place
Bring me into, into the holy place

Now it is dawn and a new day is born
But with a trail of despair
The new day was shining but many had gone
Farmer Ferdinand Hudson had lost much more than he'd won
He sat by a table and cried in his rum
The cobwebs hung heavy and dreary beside
All that looked at him could barely decide
He passed for one day so to sleep in that night
And early that morning he died

[Chorus]
He said he had fallen so in love with me
And I said "ditto, ditto, ditto"
He told me I'm the only one that he could see
And I said "ditto, ditto, ditto."
It's been a while my baby
I told you we could love in spite of all the things that they see
I said I wouldn't want no one if all you wanted was me
I knew back then you were the only one you're all that I need
Oh, knew that you were all that I need
Baby, now I gotta be
Part of you you're part of me
All my heart
Everything
All this time you've been waiting
[Chorus]
I've looked far to find somebody that was there for me
That sees part of me nobody else could ever see
And I said
Aww baby
I need your lovin'
All I wanted was you
You're all that I wanted
Yeah, baby, now I gotta be
Part of you, you're part of me
All my heart
Everything
All this time you've been waiting
I've thought about it oh so long
How much I need you more and more
I said baby if you want it from me
Boy you know that I will agree
[Chorus]
Ain't it so funny how real love can be simple, baby
When you find someone to share it with who feels the same
I can see it in your eyes the words you mean to say
Baby you can rest assured I, that I feel the same
[Chorus: x 2]

(Pretty brown, aight)
(Yeaugh!)
Is it a crime to want that old thing back?
Can it be wrong to miss the way you used to kiss me?
(Back!) Back in the day
(Back!) Back to the way you used to love me (you used to love me)
Now you've got me ready to break the law again,
Cause I made a vow to rock with you til the end
So, tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
Cause I remember when you said!
Right from the door, said can we talk?
You had me caught, got to admin it love
Let's cut straight to the point,
You know with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start
Let's cut straight to the point
Baby you know with me is where you belong
Pretty brown eyes! You know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I!
Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty brown eyes!
So let's go, let me know
You know where you belong,
What's the hold?
Baby you know with me is where you belong
It's like one minute your warm,
And then the next your so cold,
I never know when your coming or going, Hey!
Tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
I still remember when you said
Right from the door, said can we talk?
You had me caught, got to admit it love
Let's cut straight to the point
You known with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start
Let's cut straight to the point
Baby you know with me is where you belong!
Pretty brown eyes! You know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I!
Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty Brown Eyes!
And I don't want to be the one to tell you everything!
Cause I've been spending all my time give you a chance to change!
You say your in love, But!
If this is love, What!
Can I do to make it feel better?
And what about the feeling that there's someone on the side?
Cause lately you've been acting like you got so much to hide!
Cause I know that lately you ain't been the same,
And so I got to let you know that!
Pretty brown eyes! You know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I!
Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty brown eyes!
Don't move on, don't move on,
Don't move on, don't move on,
Don't move on, move on from me yea!
We belong together!
Forever! Ever! Ever!
Forever and ever and ever, yea!

I was eight years old one Christmas Eve
I heard a great big bang in our chimney
I snuck down the stairs and peaked around the door
Our living room was a dance floor
Saw Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
That tinsel on our Christmas tree turned into neon lights
He was shaking his suit from side to side
I could not believe my eyes
Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
All at once his fingers started to snap
And that jolly old man put down his bag
He was doing the swim and clapping his hands
He transformed into a moon walking man
Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
(Boogie woogie, Santa boogie woogie)
That tinsel on our Christmas tree turned into neon lights
He was shaking his suit from side to side
I could not believe my eyes
Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
I heard the elves say
"Santa, we've got work to do"
"Chill out, man, I'm busting a move"
"What about all the other kids"
"Ho ho, ho ho, you're right, we better go"
I saw Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
That tinsel on our Christmas tree turned into neon lights
He was shaking his suit from side to side
I could not believe my eyes
Santa boogie woogie Christmas
Man, I wish my friends could see this
Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
Ho ho, ho ho, ho
Ho ho, ho ho
Yeah, Rudy
Now we're cooking

J'ai la tte qui clate
J'voudrais seulement dormir
M'tendre sur l'asphalte
Et me laisser mourir
My head is exploding
I would only want to sleep
Lay on the asphalt
And let myself die
Stone
Le monde est stone
Je cherche le soleil
Au milieu de la nuit
Stone
The world is stone
I'm looking for the sun
In the middle of the night
J'sais pas si c'est la terre
Qui tourne l'envers
Ou bien si c'est moi
Qui m'fait du cinma
I don't know if it's the earth
That turn the wrong way
Or if it's myself
Who's making cinema
Stone
Le monde est stone
Stone
The world is stone
J'ai plus envie d'me battre
J'ai plus envie d'courir
Comme tous ces automates
Qui btissent des empires
Que le vent peut dtruire
Comme des chteaux de cartes
I don't wanna fight anymore
I don't wanna run anymore
Like all these robots
Who build empires
That wind can destroy
Like house of cards
Stone
Le monde est stone
Je cherche le soleil
Au milieu de ma nuit, , ,
Stone
The world is stone
I'm looking for the sun
In the middle of the night, , ,
Laissez-moi me dbattre
N'venez pas m'secourir
Venez plutt m'abattre
Pour m'empcher d'soufrir
Let me struggle
Don't come assist me
Come to kill me instead
To prevent me from suffering
J'ai la tte qui clate
J'voudrais seulement dormir
M'tendre sur l'asphalte
Et me laisser mourir
Et me laisser mourir
My head is exploding
I would only want to sleep
Lay on the asphalt
And let myself die
And let myself die

It's time now to turn off the light
This has been such a beautiful night
We have served you a lot of delights
And some really wonderful sights
My friend, this is the end
So long and see you soon again
Bye bye, kissing you hi
Someday we will be back together
[Chorus]
Goodbye to the circus
We hope you enjoyed the show
Now it's nearly at the end
But it will be back, you know
It will be back, you know
It will be back, you know
You have given us all of the best
You are beating inside our chest
Staying with us as time has gone by
Gave us hope when tide was high
My friend, this is the end
So long and see you soon again
Bye bye, kissing you hi
Someday we will be back together
[Chorus]
The band played on, from dusk till dawn
And time is almost gone
The beat goes on, it's almost done
This music marathon
It will be back, you know
It will be back, you know
So ,
[Chorus]
So,
[Chorus]
We will be back, you know
We will be back, you know

I can't be responsible
For anything I do now or say now
I get too excitable
To control the way I behave now
I'm afraid of what I'll do
If I find myself alone with you
It's just a crime of passion baby
Don't hold it against me
I'm innocent
I'm just out of my mind
I plead insanity
Whoa, I'm so mad about you
I can't think straight, I can't see straight
I plead insanity
All I do is obsess about you
I can't work days
I can't sleep nights
I plead insanity
I know that there are rules for this
And I plan to break every one of them
And if I go too far tonight
Baby you can be my alibi
And if I act irrational
I'm not responsible
For anything that happens here
Don't hold it against me
I'm innocent
I'm just out of my mind
I plead insanity
All I do is obsess about you
I can't work days
I can's sleep nights
I plead insanity
I plead insanity
Whoa, I'm so mad about you
I can't think straight, I can't see straight
I plead insanity
All I do is obsess about you
I can't work days
I can't sleep nights
I have a fantasy.

I been kickin' myself ever since
I gave my love to you a hundred percent
And you gave nothin' in return
The only time you seemed concerned
Is when you wanted to lay up
You kept telling me that I was the one
And you kept sellin' me dream after dream
But after so many dreams deferred
I saw you for what you were
And that was someone who really didn't care
[Chorus]
How can somethin' feel so right really be so wrong
Why were you for the ride
I just can't let you get back inside
And now you're wantin' to make it right
Blowin' up my pager and phone day and night
Like I should up and let you in
To my open arms again
I don't think so, not a chance
I am stronger now thanks to you
I've turned a negative thing into something positive
Now I know that I can live
Without the likes of you around
And now you swear to god
That you have made a change
But when I look at you
I think of all the pain
You unnecessarily
Brought on me
Never again, never again

I leave the home of a lifetime
Like any son
I have hope and good intentions
And wandering into the daybreak
I learn as I go
To fall laughing into the water
Sticks and the stones are your broken promises
We wait too long to go from rags to riches
I am in love, I am in love with a feeling
A wild wild sky, a wild wild sky
Fences and tumble down bridges surround and divide
I wear a coat of many colours, of many colours
The sticks and the stones, our broken promises
I wait no longer to go from rags to riches
People are leaving the squalor
They're leaving the houses and fires
And starting out
We find the waiting country
Sticks and the stones are your broken promises
I wait no longer, I go from rags to riches
From rags to riches
I go from rags to riches
Go from rags to riches
From rags to riches

When the wind is blowing in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Pray to Him
He will show
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you safe
Stand strong and you will grow
Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile
Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while you are on the ground
Don't let any emotions show, hmm
People always speculate
Don't let them get in your way
See they say things they don't know
Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile
Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need them
Cause your stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever
Sing
Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile
Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile

I can still remember the time
You were there when I needed to hold
you, feel you
Every time I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
It is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You've said you'd changed, but I'm afraid
It's something I won't live to see
It seems so strange
That sometimes fate
Can appear to be so real and yet turn out to be
a fantasy
[Brigde]
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna kepp your promises
Same old game (you know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (you're singing that same old song)
No more lies (if you don't want to find me gone,
gone, gone, gone, gone)
[Chorus]
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you
because of you, I guess we're through (through)
Is this the way it has to be
I've been a fool (I've been a fool)
A fool for you (a fool for you)
But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me)
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
I can still remember the time
You were there when I needed to hold
you, feel you
Every time I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
It is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Angel made in heaven
All I want is your love
Gimme some of that action, reaction
Angel made in heaven
All I want is your love
Gimme some of that action
Found out I was standing
In your firing line
You made the mark
Your arrow went through me
Cut a real impression
On this heart of mine (on this heart of mine)
Now what you want is happening to me (to me)
Angel made in heaven
All I want is your love
Gimme some of that action, reaction
Angel made in heaven

All I want is your love
Gimme some of that action
Arrow in my heart
Yeah we were meant to be
I knew it was my name you were calling
Celebration now you're standing next to me (stand next to me)
It's only love in motion
I'm falling (I'm falling)
Angel made in heaven
All I want is your love
Gimme some of that action, reaction
Angel made in heaven
All I want is your love
Gimme some of that action
Be my lover
I don't want another
My angel from heaven
Be my lover
I don't want another
My angel from heaven
Angel, angel

featuring N'Sync
[Shamari]
There you are
Looking as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you looking at me
What you want to do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare?
Baby talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind, baby oh
1 - Oh baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy
[J.C.]
Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if
I told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thang
I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timb's, my baggy jeans
My thug appeal
Do you like it when a man can keep it real?
Oh
Repeat 1
Oh, baby
[Shamari]
Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good you make me feel inside
[J.C.]
There's not a single question
That we can't make this right
Cause it's you I need every day and night
[J.C. & Shamari]
oh ho ho baby yeah
Repeat 1 until fade

In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Oh I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let ya go
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
I remember (I remember) that night in bed
Well the stars (the stars) were bright above
I hope and I pray
To keep your precious love
So before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
So before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
In the still of the night

This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away
Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Fanny & chorus
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Angels in the sky
Promise that be by and by
There's gonna be a great day
Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn
You will hear his horn
It's not far away
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
Great day
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Angels in the sky
Promise that by and by
We're gonna see a great day
Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn'
You will hear his horn, his horn
It's not far away
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
When the skies went darker, oh lord!
Came noah's ark, oh lord!
Amen and amen!
Amen and amen!
He came in january, february, march, april, may, june
July, and august, september october, november,
De de december
It was a great day
It was a great day
The Lord helps those who pray
And on judgment day
If you believe he will receive you Amen
Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn
You will his horn, his horn
It's not far away
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great
We're gonna see a great
There's gonna be,
Be a great day.

So many twenty fifths of December
Just as many fourth of July's
And we're still holdin' it together
It only comes down to you and I
I know that you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keepin' those words deep down in my heart
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by
I never been much for occasions
But you never let another birthday go by
Without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there, right there in your eyes
And were still holding hands when were walkin'
Actin' like we've only just met
But how could that be when there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

Why stick around when it just hurts, that's the million dollar question
What's the point of trying to work it out when it just don't work
I keep trying,
The problem is that I know the answers,
I'm supposed to say cause love is what the whole means
But what do you do when the fairy tale truth, just don't work for you anymore
You give up, you give up, throwing the towel away ...
Say you had enough, you give up, you give up
When there's no more fight left in you
And your best just ain't enough
There's nothing left to do but give up
Why struggle on when you can't win, that's the million dollar question
If everything says let it why can't you let it in
Why keep ... yourself, you see the problem is that I know the answers
I'm supposed to say cause love is what the whole means
But what do you do when the fairy tale truth, just don't work for you anymore

Shirley temple on ice
She makes it just right
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her body's so tight up under that light
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me wantin' her
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Come on and let's all dance until the break of dawn
You got me fienin' on you and it's all so strong
You got me movin' so close, you wrap me like a ghost
Like a spell on me and I just can't let go
5 foot 8, on a lake, what a date
She fell for the hook and the bait
I took her to the yacht, for shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym, so she could get in shape
What a night, no more drama, just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin' out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville
Breakin' these hoes like Jacks and Jill
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me wantin' her
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Come on and let's all dance until the break of dawn
You got me fienin' on you and it's all so strong
You got me movin' so close, you wrap me like a ghost
Like a spell on me and I just can't let go
I'm lookin' at the most beautiful thang in the world
Her body so perfect and spinnin' like a cinnamon swirl
She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural
This one's a beast, but way too wonderful to be compared to an animal
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me wantin' her
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Yes, I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe)
Come on and let's all dance until the break of dawn
You got me fienin' on you and it's all so strong
You got me movin' so close, you wrap me like a ghost
Like a spell on me and I just can't let go

The queen she divides her land into three
She is as cruel as she wants to be
Many an hour she sits there all alone
All alone, but always thinking
Which of my children loves me the best?
I'll give them everything, leave none to the rest
I'll give them all my land and my jewels too
But my love, none shall have it
Mother, dear mother, you've done me great wrong
You married me when I was far too young
The man was rich, but he left me with a child
I need your gold to feed him
Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I married you to a great lord's son
Find a new man for when I'm dead and gone
As for gold, I'll give you nothing
Mother, dear mother, if you see fit
Grant me your kingdom and I'll watch over it
I will rule your land as you would yourself
For I am most like you
Daughter, dear daughter, no, I don't see fit
To give you my land, you'll have none of it
Your words offend me for how could you presume
That you could rule as I do?
Which of my children loves me the best?
I'll give them everything, leave none to the rest
I'll give them all my land and my jewels too
But my love, none shall have it
Mother, dear mother, I do not want your land
I don't want your riches, nor jewels on my hand
My request is simple, it's every child's desire
I only want your blessing
Daughter, dear daughter, you're nothing but a fool
This world is governed by one and only rule
I will die with all my land and my jewels too
And my love, none shall have it

I think my heart might explode
'Cause now I feel the weight
Of your love on me now
From my head down to my toes
And I can't handle nothin' else
I'm staring at the mirror at these clothes
And it's funny, they mean about as much as yesterday
Something is calling me home, me home
I can hear your voice and I'm not afraid
Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
But now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Trying to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine
Boy, I'll take care of the storm
Lets sneak right pass the cloud up where it's warm
I can handle the people
They're just pebbles on a long, long road
Staring at the sky, at those stars
And it's funny, they seem about as far as tomorrow
Something is calling me home, me home
And I'm not afraid
'Cause I can see everything from high above
The earth is a little place next to my love
I can reach from here to where you are
If you look for me in the sky, I'm not that far
Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
But now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Trying to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine
And Now I feel bigger then the trees
That hold the leaves
Bigger then the mountains
That touch the seas
Bigger then the night
That leads to day
Bigger then the waves
That crash at bay
Bigger oh ooh, bigger oh ooh
Bigger oh ooh, oh oh ooh
Bigger, er, er ooh
When all of the world seems to get you down
Just know that I'm always gonna be around
My heart's in my head and that's where it'll stay
I love you too much, just like I did today
Now I know I'm just a girl (girl)
Trying to make my way through this life
(Trying to make it through this life)
But now I feel bigger then the world
(Bigger than the world, bigger than the world)
With your hand in mine
(Hand in mine)
Like a speeding bullet
(Oh-ooh oh-oh bigger)
(Oh-ooh oh-oh bigger)
Trying to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger then the world (ooh)
With your hand in mine
Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
But now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Trying to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine

Have you ever stared into the rain
Thought the clouds would never disappear
Have you ever screamed out into the dark
Thinking no one else could hear
I was leaving footprints tainted by my past
On this winding road to you
[Chorus]
I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
Now I feel whole again
You bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
and I believe
I believe again
Have you ever spun out of control
Like you never saw the road ahead
Have you ever just kept looking back
Ever closer to the edge
I was praying for the light I see in your eyes
I had all but given up
[Chorus]
[Repeats in background]
I believe the impossible is possible to overcome
I believe in miracles
Born from love in everyone
[Chorus]
I believe the impossible is possible to overcome
I believe in miracles
Born from love in everyone

When your gone it feels like
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you
(Uh, yeah)
Baby, baby, baby
Am I addicted
When I need you here all the time
And I'm not sure if this is healthy
Is it a sickness?
'Cause I feel like I'm losing my mind
And I know that there's no medicine
Nothing I can take, no remedy
Baby please stay
(Oh oh)
When your gone it feels like
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you
Oh oh oh baby baby baby
I get a fever
Just the thought of you leaving my side
Oh
Its not the same til your back holding me
That's all I need
(Oh yeah)
When your gone it feels like (when your gone baby)
My whole worlds gone with you (gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you
Whoa whoa
Here's what I'm going through when your gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
(Oh oh)
Tossin' and turnin' in my bed
Waking up drenched in a cold sweat
(Oh oh)
Lying here lonely for you
What am I suppose to do
When I'm stuck and I cant get enough of your love
Oh oh whoa baby
When your gone it feels like (when your gone baby)
My whole worlds gone with you (gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now its my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you

You're a tough tail-gunner in a pitch black Chevy
Cruising in the moonlight
Ooh your aim is steady
Your eyes are hungry and your hands are ready
You shot me where you wanted
You put me in a daze
No matter where you go, you'll always be a stranger
Getting into trouble, getting off on danger
Riding out of town like a cool lone ranger
When there's nothing to lose, you gotta call your own plays
Did anybody say something incredibly stupid
Like there isn't any paradise
But I remember the songs and I remember the story
I remember the thrills and I remember the glory
So hold me hold me in your arms
Deliver me from growing old
Hold me hold me in your arms
Shelter me from going cold
I'm a shot in the dark without you
A rebel without a clue
Rebel without a clue
I don't know what to say and I don't know what to do
Standing on the corner in my boots and my leather
A little over the edge, a little under the weather
Just a rebel without a clue
I'm tired an lonely and crying for you
I know just when to sulk and I know just how to pose
Dirty Harry to Madonna
I've been learning all the roles
So hold me baby, hold me a little longer
Need me baby just a little stronger tonight
Move it darling move a little quicker
Prove it darling blood is really thicker tonight
Drive on darling drive a little farther
Dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
Teach me baby teach me how to love you
Without me you're just another rebel without a clue
It's been a long hot summer and it's just the beginning
So keep our motor running and your tires spinning
So many places that I've wanted to be in
Take me where you're going away beyond above
We'll see a little action, relieve a little tension
Stuff I'd like to try that I shouldn't even mention
I've gone so far already I'm way beyond redemption
There's nothing to it really I think they call it love
Did anybody say something incredibly stupid
Like there isn't any paradise
But I remember the songs and I remember the story
I remember the thrills and I remember the glory
So hold me hold me in your arms
Deliver me from growing old
Hold me hold me in your arms
Shelter me from going cold
I'm a shot in the dark without you
A rebel without a clue
Rebel without a clue
I don't know what to say and I don't know what to do
Standing on the corner in my boots and my leather
A little over the edge, a little under the weather
Just a rebel without a clue
I'm tired and lonely and crying for you
I know just when to sulk and I know just how to pose
Dirty Harry to Madonna
I've been learning all the roles
So hold me baby, hold me a little longer
Need me baby just a little stronger tonight
Move it darling move a little quicker
Prove it darling blood is really thicker tonight
Drive on darling drive a little farther
Dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
Teach me baby teach me how to love you
Without me you're just another rebel without a clue

Sail along, silvery moon,
Trail along lover's lane,
Sail along, silvery moon,
To my love again.
In the glow of your light,
Let me see her tonight,
Once again, hold her tight,
Back in lover's lane.
And then the whole world will seem brighter,
As we stroll hand in hand,
Two blue hearts will be lighter,
You understand,
Sail along silvery moon,
Trail along lover's lane,
Sail along, silvery moon,
To my love again.

Angel, angel or so
Wherever you may go
Hm, yeah,
I'll follow
And always will I be there
Shake worries from your hair
Hm, yeah,
I'll be there
Always, wherever you may go

I had a vision that the colours had bled away
and I had nothing to follow
Was in a prison and my life was stuck on replay
And all my wishes were hollow
You were a beam of light
Lit up my broken sky
There was just something about you
I had a vision and it painted the world for me
And now I'm laying beside you
I don't need to wander any more
I have found what I've been looking for
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map to tell me where I'm at
Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again and
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map, you'll always light the path
The dawn is bright and
My perception is open wide
You know you flooded my senses
What you inspire is a feeling I can't describe
Forgotten all my defences
You were a beam of light
Lit up my broken sky
There was just something about you, ooh
I had a vision and you painted the world for me
And now I'm staying beside you
I don't need to wander any more
I have found what I've been looking for
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map to tell me where I'm at
Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again and
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map, you'll always light the path
Follow me
I believe, I believe, I believe in more than I can see
I believe, I believe, I believe in more than I can see
Now I believe in more than I can see
Now I can breathe again and
I don't need a map to know the way
I don't need a map you'll always light the path

Love is more than a feeling
Love is more than a feeling to me
Love is more than a feeling
Love is more than a feeling to me
More than a feeling
More than a name
More than emotion
Could ever explain
More than a passion
More than a trend
More than a lover
More than a friend
More than a friend
[Chorus]
(Here we go) x3
A New beat coming to getcha
A New rhythm sent to fetch ya
More than a feeling
More than a craze
More than a path
More like a maze
More like a maze
(Now here comes the music)
[Chorus]
(Here we go) x4
Time for a change
Time for a new thing
New chance to dance
New song to sing
See the rhythm, feel the vibe
New nation
Come alive
Come alive
[Chorus]
(Here we go) x8

Excuse me baby
What's the deal?
Could you tell me baby
How you feel?
I never tried to
Cross the line
Though I stepped on it
A couple times
She, She, She, She, didn't go
She didn't know
That she been looking past the bad things I do
She didn't go
She, she didn't know
That's why she'll always be the one I cater to
[Bridge]
Baby be the leader (oh)
I'm the receiver (oh oh)
I'ma follow you baby, follow you baby
Baby be the leader (Oh)
I'm the receiver (Oh Oh)
I'ma follow you baby, follow you baby
[Chorus]
She stayed with me and
She didn't leave
Though all the times you didn't go go go go
She stayed with me and
She didn't leave
Though all the times you didn't go go go go
Baby yes I know I made mistakes
But I was straight up with you (Yes I told the truth)
The truth about every time
I was never the type to lie
She, She, She, She, didn't go
She didn't know
That she been looking past the bad things I do
She didn't go
She, she didn't know
That's why she'll always be the one I cater to
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Excuse me baby
What's the deal?
Can you tell me baby
How you feel
I never tried to cross the line

Shine the light, shine the light...
Shine the light on me...
I just want you to shine the light on me...
Shine the light if you love me...

Rap 1:
Here comes tomorrow,
Drag in to the trapper,
No more can stoppin',
Ticket like a fun,
That is wanna fast
To think about the past,
Everywhere the human restless lost in space,
Here comes the future - the past is gone,
It's goin' up an' down - run 'n' run 'n' on 'n' on,
Scorn my born,
To abreak the doom,
Forget about sorrow,
Here comes tomorrow.
Chorus:
Here comes tomorrow -
The past is gone,
The future has begun;
It's goin' on 'n' on.
Here comes tomorrow -One step ahead,
The future has begun;
No time for being sad.
Bridge 1:
Here comes tomorrow,
The past is gone,
Here comes tomorrow
And it's goin' on 'n' on.

Here comes tomorrow -
The future begins.........
Bridge 2:
Has Nmansand exist?The mirror - 'cause I mist,The world could be the same.
Come in for Nomansland,
When will the future end?
It's just not again.
Vers:
Magic space
Begin to play,
No naked body had we will in every day.
Telling lies
For run away -
Believin' in the future - run away.
Rap 2:
Here comes tomorrow.........
Move up cemetry lost in the centurity,
Every time, every place,
Highs with the shoes,
No one lay my fuse,
It seems to be; reality!
What about the world ( in ) eternety?
What about the world - insanity?!
Fans in true, welcome to the show,
Down on the zero -
Here comes tomorrow.
Rap 3:
Physical lovers all lost in the future -The point of no return,
Now breakin' up to a bran'new aerial,
We close to enter - the land of Utopia,
It's a vice; again will it faster and faster,
None master lives into ( a world ) of all this disaster,
What about the place of eternety?
What about the world - insanity?!
The past is gone, you know; let it go!
Forget about sorrow -Here comes tomorrow!!!

Move your body to be alone
Shake your body to sing a song
DJ's on the microphone
This is the beat c'mon c'mon
Yoo ooh
When I wake up in the night
I look in to your eyes
I got a feeling
When I know just what you feel
You're really what I need
I got a feeling
When I give my love
When I give my love
When I give my love
In the light
When I give my love
When I give my love
When I give my love
In the night
When I make a good deed
When I live in sadness
I got a feeling
When I want to turn back
When I try to change myself
I got a feeling
Move your body to be alone
Shake your body to sing a song
DJ's on the microphone
This is the beat c'mon c'mon
When I give my love
When I give my love
When I give my love
In the light
When I give my love
When I give my love
When I give my love
In the night

Wanna tell you I'm alright
Wanna say I'm not in pain
But I would just be telling lies
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Wanna travel back in time
Say the things I didn't say
I wanna tell you everything
If it's not too late
Is it too late?
Will you be there if I call?
Will you leave me in the rain?
If I say it's all my fault,
Will you still walk away?
I understand if you're afraid
But people change
People change
Stay awake and talk to me
Let me hold you while you sleep
I've been out here on my own
But you're my home
You're my home
Will you be there if I call?
Will you leave me in the rain?
If I say it's all my fault,
Will you still walk away?
I understand if you're afraid
But people change
People change
I'm not gonna let you down this time
Darling, don't be afraid
People change
And I can change
Will you be there if I call?
Will you leave me in the rain?
If I say it's all my fault,
Will you still walk away?
I understand if you're afraid
But people change
People change
People change
People change

To you babe, you are all I need to make me happy. Cause every time
you're near, all the tears inside the raindrops, all the sadness in my
laughter goes away.
Oh yeah.

I'm tired of living in Asia,
I'm tired of walking alone.
I'm thinking of crossing the border.
Whoa, to a new romance,
New romance,
New romance.
I'm drifting away from the mainland,
I'm drifting away from the shore.
I'll try not to look back in anger,
I've tried not to look back at all.
Back at all,
Back at all
She moves like a shadow in motion,
She moves like a shadow of night;
A figure from over the ocean,
A figure surrounded by the light.
By the light,
By the light
She's over the border,
She's over the border,
Over the border.

Here and now
We are alone
Time she will hold her breath
Only the worms and angels
Know our names
But they have not found us
Although they surround us
I feel the distance closing
Come along
For you and I know
We've lived through the centuries
We've ridden the darkest horses
All our lives
We hunted our enemies
We fought with a fallacy
It's time we were all God's children
Far away
The galaxies soar
The stars are exploding still
I wish we could fly away
Fly away.
Here and now
For you and I know
True love is deathless
These crumbling days are ending
By my side
Let's walk in the garden
We'll sleep in the ivy
We'll be with the worms and angels

Nick is not in the audience for fanny's opening night, and she's worried,
But when he makes a late appearance at the party, she's angry at him until
He tells her that a hurricane has destroyed their casino and he's lost all
Her money. Fanny doesn't think it's that big a deal, and this makes nick
Angry. fanny doesn't understand why:
Who are you now,
Now that you're mine?
Are you something more
Than you were before?
Are you warmer in the rain,
Are you stronger for my touch,
Am I giving too little
By my lovin' you too much?
How is the view,
Sunny and green?
How do you compare it to

Heart to heart - I need to surrender
Don't look back - my blue eyes cry
Face to face - oh loving me tender
Oh, again and again - baby, dreams will fly
Lost in love - afraid of a stranger
I'm too young to cry my tears
Love's life - instead of a danger
Oh, again and again babe, I hate the disease
Baby, you're the man who save my world babe
Baby, you're the man and I'm your girl
Face to face and heart to heart, babe
You're playing the game and you play it smart
Oh, it's a fire of love - a fire of love
That you'll share with me
Oh, it's a fire of love - a fire of love
And my love's free
Cheek to cheek - we're staying together
Don't give up - just you and me
Tears of love - we're staying forever
Oh again and again - 'cause I feel what you feel
Touch a hand and feel the desire
Don't waste days - don't waste nights
Make a friend and feel the fire
Oh, again and again baby, hold me tight
Baby, you're the man who save my world babe
Baby, you're the man and I'm your girl
Face to face and heart to heart, babe
You're playing the game and you play it smart

A pillow to rest my weary head
The end of a working day
The door to the dream left open
I won't be turned away
A winter coat for a wind so cold
The age of age old need
A town to live and call my own
A way and a will to succeed
Yes I am lucky
Yes I am lucky
I'm a lucky man indeed
A town to live and call my own
A way and a will to succeed
I may search for happiness
And not know what it takes
And still be here a thousand years
And make the same mistakes
Yes I am lucky
Yes I am lucky
I'm a lucky man indeed
A town to live and call my own
A way and a will to succeed

I'm never thin I'm never svelte
I always wore the bigger belt
I never thought I needed help choosing what to eat each moutful
A real treat but when I look and see there's a greater part of me
I see the men who work at the gym they have a ripple
With every limb they never have this excess skin
To cover up their age we're on a different page
I look like a tree there's a greater part of me
It's so hard to put on my socks each morning
When I wake I see myself when I was thin
And the hearts I used to break
Now I have tits just like my mum
I'm out breath before I run I like to eat
Because it's fun but it comes at such a price.
I'm on the old brown rice and the herbal tea
For the greater part of me
I always played the boy in goal cross country runs
Became a stroll I was the doughnut and the hole
But inside I felt great I always licked my plate my face

Party the people, the people the party it's popping no sitting around,
I see you looking you looking I see you I look at what you started now
Let's hook up little one on one up come on give some of the that stuff,
Let me freshin' it with no ruff (let's go)
Let's hook up when we start we won't stop,
Baby, baby don't stop come on give me some of that stuff (let's go)
I am, Black Culture
I am, Black Culture

End up with nothing
But for me you might
Say I'm too blunt
I'm type of girl that gets
What I want
I don't really care
About what you want
If you ain't got the cash
Then don't front
Gotta get a crib, gotta get
A car, get a diamond ring

Invest in you

Make him buy you carrots,
Like vegetables
Then you can laugh with your friends standing next to you

The clothes, the jewels, the doe

The world through your eyes looks so elegant
That perfect slanting light, the satin gowns
Could it really be such a place of harmony?
And the stars glitter off your walls
And your stars never fade at all
The moment is caught, saved forever
That gaze in the glass, the shadowed room
Could it really be or is it trick photography?
And the stars glitter off your walls
And your stars never fade at all
Your daughters are there, full of tenderness
That introspective look you know so well
Could it really be such a happy family?
And the stars glitter off your walls
And your stars never fade at all

I put all my eggs in the bacon slicer
but now it's turned out fine.
in fact it couldn't be nice
a nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider
seven days later I was a man of the world
...... I thought
I'll go and get a slice of pizza from the pizzeria
oh, and a coke
has anybody got the change of five quid
I'm happy to be here
so happy to be here
and I wish that you were here
unhappy with me and happy to be here
so happy to be here
but you'd had to have been there to be here
with me
I played a blinder against a gaggle of nuns
I was all mouth and trousers they were fingers
and thumbs had a lesson from the vicar on oral hygiene
he was stitching my trousers, and staring at
Christine she had three tickets to see Alfie at the Odeon
"What's it all about Christine?"
free you mind
yeah... but what the...
I'm happy to to be here
so happy to be here
and I wish that you were here
unhappy with me
I'm happy to be here
so happy to be here
but you'd had to have been there to be here
with me

if you meet a long forgotten friend
and he takes you in his arms and smiles
and he tells you long forgotten tales
and he takes you home for a nightride
and he begs you, please, stay here with me
in the end you agree
remember: you're just being recycled
so everything you say
somebody else said it before you
and everything you do
somebody else just did it like you
and the man in the lab just grins and says
holding up a tiny can with a sperm
remember: you're just being recycled
montego bay
the air is oh so thick
there's not a single breeze
the day lies dazed upon the shelf
beyond a painted window out on a far horizon
there stands a steamboat in the sun
i rised my eyes and stared into that paralyzing light
but god had left the iron skies
this day will last forever, we pushed the final buttons
and someone disconnected time
we are here in montego bay..

Once confined, now discovered your own
Way to cope without being alone
If you've found yourself lost, you must know
What it feels like to be home
And there's no need to think anymore
All this time you were already sure
Your heart whispers in thuds
It will show you the right way to go
And it says
Hey, we can learn how to love unafraid
Don't repress all the trials you've faced
Do you know, do you know its worth?
Well I'm not sure that you do
Pay no mind to what you have been told
All the things that you think that you know
You could right all the wrongs in my heart
Fix me up with these new parts
And it says
There's a new spark
Flares from a dark heart
Somehow, new start
Flares burst
And it says
There's a new spark
Flares from a dark heart
Somehow, new start
Flares burst

So dem a com, so dem a com, dem a com, dem a com
So dem a com with a bompin' song
So dem a com with a bompin' song, so dem a com
Late in the evening when the "E-Type" left the stage
Casanova takes over, now they call me P.J.
Them balin: rampam-zibbie-dibbie, ever in style
P.J. breaks your heart and then he'll leave you with a smile
So dem a com, so dem a com, dem a com, dem a com
So dem a com with a bompin' song,
so dem a com with a bompin' song, so dem a com
P.J. comes like Jorghie-Porghie,
kiss the girls and make them cry
'Cause tonight I'm making all them pretty girls go wild
Them balin: rampam-zibbie-dibbie, ever in style
P.J. breaks your heart and then he'll leave you with a smile
Chilly toast
You'll never see it now but P.J.'s coming up
Zippin' with them jah-jah-men he's staying on the top
Them balin: rampam-zibbie-dibbie, ever in style
P.J. breaks your heart and then he'll leave you with a smile

Always knew you'd come unnanounced,
and with the placing of your hand on my back as I stand
Always knew you'd come in a dream,
She told me it would be, and I believed that old gypsy, that it would be.
I believed. She told me in a dream, that it would be.
And like a bird who wants to fly where the days are warm,
and the sun stays in the sky
You make your way back to this heart,
it's the only way that we will survive
This is how I say goodbye.
Every moment we're apart,
brings us closer to the time that we will meet again.
But until then, I'll look for you and listen for your voice in every crowded room.
And wait for the touch of your hand, while I'm standing in my circle of friends.

Save your point of view
For the manic charm that he puts you through
When he wears your pearls, your ruby dress
And he looks so good with his sunken chest
There's a certain charm
To the pretty boy that is on my arm
He's my double friend, a boy and a girl
When he says,
Paint my face, lick your mouth
Fake a yawn and we'll go out and glow
We're on our way to somewhere in particular
I'll take you somewhere, where you haven't been
And I'll show you a good time, like you've never seen
Here comes the big rush
There's a special ring
To his Cuban heels and his six-pack swing
His mother's clothes are his new disguise
And his good advice when he says:
Vanity's a virtue, lets no one in to hurt you
I'll take you somewhere, where you haven't been
And I'll show you a good time, like you've never seen
Here comes the big rush
You're one of the boys
Pump that pipe dream, sell you something
New, new, new
We're on our way to somewhere in particular
I'll take you somewhere, where you haven't been
And I'll show you a good time, like you've never seen

We need to stop, just stop
Stop for a moment
Before anybody says or does anything
That may hurt anyone else
We need to be silent, just silent
Silent for a moment
Before we forever lose the blessings of songs
That grow in our hearts
We need to notice, just notice
Notice for a moment
Before the future slips away into ashes and dust of humility
We have, we are, a mosaic of gifts
To nurture, to offer, to accept
We need to be, just be
Be for a moment
Kind and gentle, innocent and trusting
Like children and lambs
Never judging or vengeful
Like the judging and the vengeful
And now, let us pray
Differently, yet together
Before there is no earth, no life
No chance for peace
Peace for our world, our world

Computer on the move
Gonna' make your body groove
Gonna' hold you tight and lift you to the top
If your feeling kind of low
Press the trigger in you go
And you better never want to' make it stop
Sample city
Sounds so pretty
If they bit is feeding human touch
Sample city
More than pretty
Apparently it turns you too whatever it does so much
Your feeling like a clown
If you enter sample town
All the finest songs are hidden in a chip
With the funny noise around
Is it music is it sound
So you travel on a psychedelic trip
(repeat the middle verus twice)

Boy I can't stand your heat
Got me lying awake
I haven't eaten all week
Got me obsessing all day
Oh what you done to me
Can't stop calling your name
Check me I'm acting all weird
[Bridge]
All my girls say boy I'm totally gone
Acting crazy I don't know what I'm on
It's not easy tryin' to put on a front
Baby I'm speechless I don't know what you've done
[Chorus]
Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all you got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps
My coolness is blown I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit
When I hear your name I totally flip
Boy you're too hot for me
Can't stop melting away
When I see you I can't speak
Switching when I see your face
Acting like I'm a teen
Waiting outside your place
Boy this is really not me
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Completely lost my mind
Somethings taken over me
Boy you're one of a kind
Just how a man's supposed to be
Acting like I'm a teen
Calling you every day
Boy this is really not me
[Bridge]
[Chorus: x2]

Step in the club like it ain't no thang
Sittin' at the bar while I sip on dranks
Girl wanna holla tryin' to run that game
I just wanna freak that, ain't got no shame
Step in the club like it ain't no thang
Sittin' at the bar while I sip on dranks
Girl wanna holla tryin' to run that game

Roll around town with some dank in my pocket
Grandma say, "Ronnie Ray, you need to stop it"
Punk bootleggers man they fuckin' off my profit
Dip up in the club and she eye ballin' me

Step in the club like it ain't no thang
Sittin' at the bar while I sip on dranks
Girl wanna holla tryin' to run that game
I just wanna freak that, ain't got no shame
Downtown Super Bowl 38
In the clutch city ya know filfthy movin' weight
In case it get to state keep me in a G manner
All my homies roll like Tony Montana
Listen to the law, jappa jaw on the scanner
Sippin' purple hawk started bangin' David Banner
Money in the Benz but I'm layin' in the Lac
Stomach so swole throwin' up in the back
She was fine, yes sir, she was trill
Plus she had a pocket full of colorful pills
Puttin' heat through yo whole crew flannel
Cookin' them chickens put me on tha Food Channel
Roll with tha pimps, oh nah I'm not a balla
Sell up on those cities like a blue night crawler
Call her on the celly, work my jelly meet the mami at the telly
Roll a fatty, jump in tha ride and disappear like Makaveli, say what
Step in the club like it ain't no thang
Sittin' at the bar while I sip on dranks

Man I step in tha club like it ain't no thang

Paparazzi takin' pictures and tha haters lookin' mad
But the boppers showin' love and I'm signin' autographs
Bartender know me and he know I do tha fool
E'ry body in my ear and I'm like who is you?
Give me fifty Hennessy's on tha rocks for these boys
Can't stand male groupies move around with that noise
I'm tryin' to sit down and roll up and get blowed
Find somethin' I can take back to tha mo-mo
Like that right there you lookin' good no doubt
What you got under that skirt, girl whatchu talkin' 'bout?
I'm waitin' for my boys downstairs to get done
They wouldn't let me on stage they said I was too drunk
But it's about to be two girl, tell me if you're ready

Notch after notch in tha club on tha weeknight

Grab this Hennessey by the hair and make her speak right

Step in the club like it ain't no thang
Sittin' at the bar while I sip on dranks
Girl wanna holla tryin' to run that game
I just wanna freak that, ain't got no shame

There was a time when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room
Because I didn't want to
Have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe, but
[Chorus]
I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
You were my earth
My number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me
I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told me that you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone
Now you say you never meant to play your games
Girl don't you know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart
[Chorus]
When you said goodbye
I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
Baby after all the misery
And pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl
You're no longer my world and I ain't missin' you at all
[Chorus]
See baby when you walked away
You didn't think it would end up this way
But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday
Just as sure as my name is Wanya

Kiss me now
While my lips are burning up for your sweet taste
Kiss me now
Long to feel the fiery aid of your embrace
Kiss me now
That you're someone very special in my life
Kiss me now
Love you, and I want you by my side
Kiss me now
Love me now
I ain't had no loving on since yesterday
Baby, tell me how
You expect someone to live a life that way
Each and every day, baby
I've been hoping that you will give in
Give in, give in, give in
You mean more to me than just a friend
Kiss me now
I've been waiting too long
Years, my dear, my dear, my dear
I've been very lonely
And I wish that you were here
So I could hold you near
I've been hoping that you will give in
Give in, give in, give in
You mean more to me than just a friend
Kiss me now
Kiss me

Get off your knees
Don't apologise
'Cause I ain't got no time
For no more lies
You know the answer
I gave it to you
But you carry on
With the things that you do
Yes I have tried
I, I could live, I could die
I could be reborn in your arms
I, I could laugh, I could cry, I could sigh if you're there
To keep me warm
To keep me warm, warm, warm
Talk to me
Open your eyes
Talk to me
Lose the disguise
We had good love
Most of the time
Give it back
That love is mine
Give it back
Just one more time
I, I could live, I could die
I could be reborn in your arms
I, I could laugh, I could cry, I could sigh if you're there
To keep me warm
To keep me warm, warm, warm
I know the answer
What can we do
I know the answer, yeah
So do you
I gave you love
I gave it to you
I gave you love - something new
I gave you love
I, I could live, I could die
I could be reborn in your arms
I, I could laugh, I could cry, I could sigh if you're there
To keep me warm
To keep me warm, warm, warm

Is there a time for keeping a distance
A time to turn your eyes away
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day
Is there a time for Kohl and lipstick
A time for cutting hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear
Here she comes
Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown
Is there a time to walk for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colors
Different names you find it hard to spell
Is there a time for first communion
A time for east 17
Is there a time to turn the mecca
Is there a time to be a beauty queen
Here she comes
Beauty plays the crown
Here she comes
Surreal in her crown
Dici che il fiume
trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
giungerai a me
Oltre i confini
e le terre assetate
Dici che come fiume
come fiume
L'amore giunger
L'amore
E non so pi pregare
E nell'amore non so pi sperare
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare
English translation:
You say that the river
finds the way to the sea
And as the river
you'll come to me
Beyond the borders
and the thirsty lands
You say that as river
As river
Love will come
Love
And I cannot pray anymore
And I cannot hope in love anymore
And I cannot wait for love anymore
Is there a time for tying ribbons
A time for Christmas trees
Is there a time for laying tables
When the night is set to freeze

Baby let me tell you about how I feel
This urge is seizing me, controlling it's unreal
Ooh, ahh baby, I want to let you know
You got me yearning, so baby let me show
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue cause you know...
[Chorus:]
Sympin' ain't easy, get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy, and if you want to get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead on your knees
Pardon my expression (You're excused)
But the feeling I have is so strong
I guess you know this isn't easy to do
I keep trying and trying to give my love to you
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue cause you know...
[Chorus]

I don't want to let another minute get by
They're slipping through our fingers but we're ready to fly
The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below
We got the music in our bodies and the radio
And when the morning comes It'll all be gone
Disappearing in(to) the crack of dawn
We better make our move now before the sun is awake
It's time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace
And I don't want to let another minute get by
Love is going to get us while the moon is in the sky
We may be running out of night but never running out of steam
We're acting on a hunch and we'll be acting out a dream
There really isn't any time to lose
They're going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light
You're such a pretty boy
Let me show you what to do and you'll do it
But you gotta move faster
Faster than the speed of night
[Chorus x2]
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
It's all we ever wanted
And all we'll ever need
And it's slipping through our fingers
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Let me show you how to drive me crazy
Let me show you how to make me feel so good
Let me show you how to take me to the
Edge of the stars and then back again
You've gotta show me how to drive you crazy
You've gotta show me all the things
You want to happen to you
We've gotta tell each other everything
We always wanted someone to do
I don't want to push you now and I don't want to rush
We're getting closer every second but close is not enough
The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below
We got the music in our fingers and the radio
There really isn't any time to lose
They're going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light
You're such a pretty boy
Let me show you what to do and you'll do it
But you gotta move faster
Faster than the speed of night
[Chorus x2]
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night

Say the worst thing first
You could swear you wouldn't change
But my words had lips that chose to tip
the balance just the same
I believe that some things can work better in the dark
But my one regret's we didn't get a torch before the start
And now we'll never speak again
My face says everything
And now we'll never speak again
My face says everything
Say the worst thing first
You said you couldn't, better wait
But my words were knives that broke our lives
I did it just the same
I deceive, I try to be a bigger cheat than you
But I know too late
it's not so great to hide away the truth
And now we'll never speak again
My face says everything
One my time for all times
I should've shut my mouth
and closed my eyes
to cross my legs
to save these words
This face says everything
And now we'll never speak again
My face says everything
And now we'll never speak again
My face says everything
And now we'll never speak again
My face says everything
One my time for all times
I should've shut my mouth
And now we'll never speak again

Coming with a lie
Here we go again
First you say you write
Then you take my pen
'Cause underneath your smile
You don't wanna lose
Babe, I got the style
You just got the shoes
Came in from the start
Ready for a fight
Betting that your bark
Got nothing on my bite
Now I'm number one
You'll be back for more
We'll be having fun
But you'll be keeping score
My love is better
Than your love
My heart is better
Than your heart
My moves are better
Than your moves
My shoes smell better
And I bet bet bet bet
My kiss is wetter
Than your kiss
My lips are better
Than your tricks
You know you'll never
Have these hips
I'm so much better
So eat this!
Once upon a time
You said you'd challenge me
I said, alright
I see you in your dreams
And for the last time
Shake you up, shake you up
Bet you'll have a fun time
Waking up, waking up
Once upon a time
You said you'd challenge me
I said, alright
I see you in your dreams
And for the last time
Shake you up, shake you up
Bet you'll have a fun time
Waking up, waking up
My love is better
Than your love
My heart is better
Than your heart
My moves are better
Than your moves
My shoes smell better
And I bet bet bet bet
My kiss is wetter
Than your kiss
My lips are better
Than your tricks
You know you'll never
Have these hips
I'm so much better
So eat this!
I'll let you go there if you go my way
I need to know you're happy to obey
I let you touch me every now and then
And if you want some, yeah, I'll tell you when when when
My love is better
Than your love
My heart is better
Than your heart
My moves are better
Than your moves
My shoes smell better
And I bet bet bet bet
My kiss is wetter
Than your kiss
My lips are better
Than your tricks
You know you'll never
Have these hips
I'm so much better
So eat this!

She's a sophisticated bad girl

You don't miss me now
You don't miss me now
One day you will
Be walking down the street
And you'll see someone and she will look a lot like me
And you'll think about someone you left behind
And it will make you cry
One day you will
Be starting out your day
And you'll look inside your coffee cup and see my face
And you'll realize the sad mistake you made
And it will be too late
One day you'll wonder why you ever said goodbye
And you will wish you were still right here by my side
But I won't be around
You don't miss me now
You don't miss me now
One day you will
Never find a love like what we had
Never find some like me again
Through the tears one day you'll see
That the one you need is me
You'll want me back again
One day you will
Be driving in your car
And you're gonna hear a song that's gonna break your heart
And you'll wish you'd said those words you didn't say
And it will be too late
One day you'll wonder why you ever said goodbye
And you will wish you were still right here right by my side
But baby I won't be around
You don't miss me now
You don't miss me now
One day you will
Be walking down the street
And you'll see someone and she will look a lot like me
And you'll think about someone you left behind
And it will make you cry
You don't miss me now
You don't miss me now
You don't miss me now
You don't miss me now
One day you will
One day you will

Dont you see Im here for you?
All your best interests are on my heart
I just want to roll with you
And never let the nature break us apart
The well endowed took the earth and changed it

Never shared the knowledge or confirmation
of their relation
Oh hallelujah,

And Disillusion
Disillusioned, ooh ooh
Disillusioned, ooh ooh
Disillusioned, ooh
Whats solution now?
Can't you feel a thing child?
Won't you test your seals for use?
You should make your mind up
Since you know how it feels to be abused
The well endowed took the mission, The concepts of a nation
To divide the one conscience
The young and wild take the spaceships
seeing observations
Searching for the world
Out of delusion
Disillusioned, ooh ooh
Disillusioned, ooh ooh
Disillusioned, ooh

You been waiting in a long ass line, forever, turn this bitch out
You been waiting in a long ass line, forever turn this muthafucka out.
Disillusioned, ooh ooh
Disillusioned, ooh ooh
Disillusioned, ooh Praise the lord

If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something I don't give a damn, 'cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know one plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through
'Cause baby we ain't got nothing without love
Darling you got enough for the both of us
So come on baby, make love to me
When my days look low, pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me, so when the worlds at war, that our love heal us all
Right now baby make love to me me me me me

Help me let down my guard, make love to me me me me me
Oh oh make love to me me me me me

Put your brave face on
The one you wore when you stole my heart
Won't you hold my hand
We'll jump together into anything that could
Possibly happen
Cause we're still so young
Ask me to dance in this hotel room
Then let's get out of here
And hit the airport with nothing but a carry
On between us
You take my over analyze away
It's you and me against the world today
Feels like I'm running
With my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting
For it to all go wrong
You're my umbrella against their
Sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling
They'll never know
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on
It's clear blue skies
Flying 30,000 feet above
No one can touch us
Cause we're so in love
Look into my eyes
Meet me there don't look down
Feels like I'm running
With my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting
For it to all go wrong
You're my umbrella against their
Sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling
They'll never know
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on
You take my over analyze away
It's you and me
Against the world today
Feels like I'm running
With my high heels on
And they're chasing us waiting
For it to all go wrong
You're my umbrella against their
Sticks and stones
As long as we keep smiling
They'll never know
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on
Put your brave face on

Don't talk
Let me think it over
How we gonna fix this?
How we gonna undo all the pain?
Tell me
Is it even worth it?
Looking for a straight line.
Taking back the time we can't replace.
All the crossed wires
Just making us tired.
Is it too late?
Too bring us back to life?
When I close my eyes
I try to sleep
But fall apart
And find it hard to breath
You're the reason
The only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason
The only reason
I feel you
Burning under my skin
I swear I see you shining
Brighter than the flames inside your eyes
Bitter words spoken
Everything broken
Its never too late
To bring us back to life
When I close my eyes
I try to sleep
But fall apart
And find it hard to breath
You're the reason
The only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason
The only reason
Don't talk
Let me think it over
How we gonna fix this?
How we gonna undo all the pain?
When I close my eyes
I try to sleep
But fall apart
And find it hard to breath
You're the reason
The only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason
The only reason
When I close my eyes
I try to sleep
But fall apart
And find it hard to breath
You're the reason
The only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason
The only reason

The prayers that we pray in foxholes and funerals
The songs that we sing in delivery rooms
The questions we ask when nobody's listening
But the man in the moon
The way our hearts beat, faced with a sunrise
Like maybe they know something we don't
But it's all in code and we can't decode it
Or maybe we won't
Do we dare pay attention, dare even mention
The mystery we find ourselves caught in
And do we dare to remember
All that we have forgotten
Each breath that we take, we take for granted
So if there are clues we remain unaware
All the days of our lives burn down like matches
Vanish into thin air
But there are dreams that we dream when we least expect them
And memories that come like unbidden tears
All the things we believed when we were just children
It's been so many years
Do we dare pay attention, dare even mention
The mystery we find ourselves caught in
And do we dare to remember
All that we have forgotten
We are battered and torn from the day we are born
In a world that has blinded and bound us
Is it any surprise we don't open our eyes
To the truth that's disguised all around us?
Like the secrets we keep, we don't know we're keeping
From before there was time, before there were lies
Can we find you again, this far from the garden?
Do we dare even try?
Do we dare pay attention, dare even mention
The mystery we find ourselves caught in
And do we dare to remember
All that we have forgotten?
Forgotten, forgotten

When I close my eyes I can see your face
Tho' I try I can't believe that you are gone
There's a part of you that's a part of me
And no matter where I go it comes along
Reminding me of all the good times
And, of course, some of the bad
But then again, some of those hard times
Were the best we ever had
How can I learn to say goodbye
To the only life I ever knew?
Learn to say goodbye to you?
How can I learn to say goodbye?
Tell me how do you expect me to
Say goodbye to you?
When I needed you, you were always there
You were more than love to me, you were a friend
They say that time is all that matters
And to live it while it lasts
But I can't stop from reminiscing
Or stop living in the past
How can I learn to say goodbye
To the only life I ever knew?
Learn to say goodbye to you?
How can I learn to say goodbye?
Tell me how do you expect me to
Say goodbye to you?

Okay, audience, audience
Welcome to the Alesha show
Welcome to the Alesha show
The A-L-E-S-H-A Show
Everybody let's go!

Take a pinch of one man
Wrap him up in black skin
Add a touch of blue blood
And a little bitty bit of Indian boy
Curly black and kinky
Oriental and sexy
If you lump it all together
Well you've got a recipe
For a get along scene
Oh what a beautiful dream
If it could only come true
You know you know
What we need is a great big melting pot
Big enough to take the world
And all it's got
Keep it stirring for a hundred years or more
Turn out coffee colored people
By the score
Rabbi and the friars
Bishops and the Gurus
We had the Beatles and the Sun Gods
A long time ago, it's true
But then it really didn't matter
What religion you choose no,no,no
Mick and Lady Faithfull
Lord and Mrs Graceful
You know the living could be tasteful
Why don't we all get together in a loving machine
I'd better call up the queen
It's only fair that she knows
You know , you know
What we need is a great big melting pot
Big enough to take the world
And all it's got
Keep it stirring for a hundred years or more
Turn out coffee colored people
By the score
Yeah, no

This is simple, this is basic
There's no need to complicate it
You're beautiful and I love you
And if I live for 10 forevers
Here's a moment I'll remember
Just watching you in this crowded room
If you could only see your eyes
You'd be amazed just how you shine
How you shine
This is perfect This is easy
This is falling more than deeply
More than true, it's all for you
No one else can see through me
And see the heart that your heart sees
This is perfect This is basic
Words would only complicate it
You're beautiful and I love you
So beautiful and I love you

Put on an old pair of shoes and we'll go walking down the alley
Maybe we'll run into Sally and the crowd we used to know
Put on an old pair of shoes and even though we're close to raggy
We'll go down and call on Maggie and Joe
We'll always find fair weather when the old gang gets together
We don't care whether we're broke or in the dough
We'll find the dreams left behind in all the old familiar places
As we mend the broken laces of an old pair of shoes
We'll always find fair weather

I've been down, now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When we touch
When we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When minutes turn to days and years
When mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside in your heaven
I wanna be inside
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

I want to explore you
I'm gonna get under your skin
So you can feel me running through your veins
I want to examine
Every inch of your frame
The pressure points that cause your joy and pain
Our love goes under the knife
There is no room for doubt
Now I'm inside you
My hands can feel their way
Further inside than I have ever been
Now I can really
Mess around with your heart
And fill it to the brim with broken dreams
Our love goes under the knife
Two lives may be saved
And if I pull this off
I'll refuse the Nobel prize
Instead I will look into your eyes
If I pull this off your whole body will be mine
And I'm prepared to work throughout the night
Our love goes under the knife
Nothing is taboo
Here on the cutting edge of science
Too much information
I feel I'm getting lost
Absorbed into the fiber of your soul
Deep within the abattoir
Of your entrails your insides
Lost in you forever far from home
Our love goes under the knife
Someone got too close
Our love goes under the knife
The heart was rejected by the host

The Atrocities
God visits all lost souls
To survey the damage
We noticed a bonfire
Burning in his eyes
He whispered
"It's the atrocities of your story
Of your story"
God visits all lost souls
To survey the damage
And holding his bleeding heart
A tear comes to his eye
He whispered
It's the atrocities of History
Of History
Of...

Looking down out of this little round window
On silver wings at 20,000 feet
Where lakes and streams and fields of green
I tend to think the most peculiar things
Ribbons of highways, side roads and byways
People going all ways, always in a hurry
Gotta get there, but just where, from up here
I'm not sure, where it's all going or what it all means
But sometimes I think, it's just a simple thing
I close my eyes and I realize all I really need
Is a love I had, and the love I had to give
Anything else there is, is insignificant
In this tiny life.
Waves hit the runways, some days run in to some days
And some days are better than some days
Can't see the sky, sky scrapers too high
30 second day dream at another red light
I'm back in my hometown of roads that we rode down
Those sights and sounds are just yesterdays love
There's deadlines and stress lines and too much on my mind
I'm getting it all, but what's it all for
Sometimes I think, it's just a simple thing
I close my eyes and I realize all I really need
Is a love I had, and the love I had to give
Cause anything else there is, is insignificant
In this tiny life.
The love we make, the dreams we share
The friends we have in our short time here
It's knowing Gods grace, the touch of a hand
Holding a baby, calling mom and dad
It's making the most of the moments we have
And getting to live long enough to look back
On the years, the sweet tears of joy and laughter
It's all that really matters ooh, yea, yea
Sometimes I think, it's just a simple thing
I close my eyes and I realize all I really need
Is a love I had, and the love I had to give
Cause anything else there is, is insignificant
It doesn't matter, in this tiny life.

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me
Make me, make me cry? Oh Lord
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet
When I'm already on my knees
'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Baby, baby, baby, baby tell me how
You think you're gonna live without my love now?
I don't know why you gotta keep comin' around
Creepin' up my street
Oh boy, you can't bother me
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all blows through
I ain't gonna raise my body 'til there ain't no sun
'Til there ain't no sun, 'til there ain't no sun to you
'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Don't knock on my door
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Hey there Delilah what's it like in New York City
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl tonight you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true
Hey there Delilah don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely give this song another listen
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it's my disguise
I'm by your side
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard
But just believe me girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah I can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame
Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This one's for you
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me

It was a lucky April shower, it was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby, in a five and ten cent store
The rain continued for an hour, I hung around for three or four
Around a million dollar baby, in a five and ten cent store
She was selling china, and when she made those eyes
I kept buying china until the crowd got wise, incidently
If you should run into a shower just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million dollar baby, from the five and ten cent store
She was selling china, and when she made those eyes
I kept buying china until the crowd got wise, incidently
If you should run into a shower just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million dollar baby from the five and ten cent store
From the five and ten cent store

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time

I was in the darkness, I was out in the cold
Seemed nothing could heal this, this hole in my soul
You reached out your arms to me, held out your heart to me
Pulled me back from the edge, thought I'd reached the end
When I was drowning, when I was so confused
You, you, you pulled me through
I was in the shadows, lost, nothing left to lose
You, you, you pulled me through
You gave my faith back, faith was so hard to find
You gave me my life back, you were my lifeline
The love that you gave me is love that has saved me
Your strength is what made me strong
You held me and I held on
When I was drowning, when I was so confused
You, oh you, you pulled me through
I was in the shadows, lost, nothing left to lose
You, oh you, you pulled me through
Out of the dark into your arms, into the light
Your love saved my life
When I was drowning, when I was so confused
You, oh you, you pulled me through
When I was drowning, when I was so confused
You, oh you, yeah you, you pulled me through
Oh, said you, oh you pulled me through

I'll crawl for you
Hurt if you want to
I'll be the thing that you feed
I'm not asking
For love or redemption
I'll sell my guilt to your need
I'll breathe for you
Die if you want to
I'll mourn with you by my grave
I dare you to judge me
Now God has disowned me
I've come to you to be saved
They say I
Sold my soul
And we all reap
What we sow
I'll shine for you
Burn if you want to
You'll be the prize for my pain
I'll kill your God
And pray for salvation
I'll be the in to your sane
I'll lie for you
Be your conscience in you
Sacrifice reason for shame
I won't ask for
Faith or forgiveness
I'll be the blood in your veins
They say I
lost my way
I'll wait for
Judgment day
Don't pray for my soul
Don't pray for my soul
Don't pray for my soul
Don't pray for my soul
I'll be your darkness
In the night
I'll be a vampire calling
In the dead of night
I'll be your demon
Shadow man
I'll be your one confession
And if I can
I'll be your nightmare
And scream for you
I'll be your one possession
If you want me to
I'll be your secret
Memory
I'll be your exhibition of atrocity
They say I
Sold my soul
And we all reap
What we sow
They say I
Lost my way
I'll wait for
Judgment day
Don't pray for my soul
Don't pray for my soul
Don't pray for my soul
Don't pray for my soul
They kneel down, praise God
Shout 'Hallelujah'
Lift up their eyes while they pray
When children kill children
Don't it make them wonder?
Don't it make them question their faith?

You embarrassing us
Take that monkey shit off

Now everybody gon' do it, y'all know what's up
Look on my face, and it's called the mean mug
Everybody gon' do it when they step up in the club
Mask on tight, and it's called the mean mug

But I ain't trippin' past the women and some Henny on the rocks

Fall through the door with a smirk, haters feelings gettin' hurt
'Cause I pulled that main skirt, Mac Dre on my shirt
You know we fixin' to perk, face lookin' like I
Just smelled some grand daddy purp'
Purp', you see, I like where I'm at but I love where I'm goin'
I'm leaving with a half breed Mexican and Samoan
She super bad, stuntin' hard, mean mug on her grill
Countin' feri', already steady huggin' the wheel
Now everybody gon' do it, y'all know what's up, look
On my face, and it's called the mean mug
Everybody gon' do it when they step up in the club
Mask on tight, and it's called the mean mug

Somebody told us we look like we 'bout to whoop a ass
So I told them this everybody gon' do it

We'll show you how to do it, start lookin' hella mad
Start gettin' hella crunk, start goin' hella bad
Even though the fine girls make you look real good
Sweat drippin', teeth grittin', that's that peel look

(Now everybody gon' do it)
Mean muggin', mean muggin'
Mean muggin', mean muggin'
(Now everybody gon' do it)

Let me sit down and tell you how this thing has really started
When I come around you act like loving you is under audit
So baby can you give me just little more (time)
Cause I'm having problem's trying to read your (mind)
I really don't know what to do with you
I was too into you now I'm through with you
[Chorus]
Can we go
Can we go back (to where love is)
Can we go
Can we go back (to where love is)
Pretty memories coming back to me but I remember
What you said to me when you walked away the other day
Is what I remember most
Trying to get past the things you said
Holding on to all the love I thought we had
Wishing I could just replace
Trying to erase all the pain
[Chorus]
Girl you know I can't foresee this
I want to try but I can't deny this feeling
Baby think of what you're saying
Can we try cause I won't stop believing
[Chorus: x2]

I can't believe
That you're gone and we're alone
I can't believe
That we'll never see your face
I can't believe
That you're at the gates of Heaven
I can't believe
That we'll never know you
If only, if only
Miracles happened every day
If only, if only
I could believe in something
Helpless we cried over you
Empty and lost over you
How in the world
Can they say that you're at peace?
How in the world
Can they say that time will heal us?
How in the world
Can we hope to be forgiven?
How in the world
Can we know how we feel?
If only, if only
We could all live forever
If only, if only
No memories to remember
Words were not spoken for you
No grave marks our love for you
Broken our hearts call for you
No-one can blame us but you
How in the world can we ever smile again
How in the world can we live without you

Tracks still coming, Tears still running.
Still wondering remising, pull my shoebox out from under the bed.
Letters I've read before, Just keep them threw out the years.
The emotion running threw me as I reed once again.
NOTHING!
Seems that's all that's left, with everyone come stress, joy,
Felling's I cant explain.
Out of all these ex-dames none still around.
Makes me not want love,
Butt still I search and always end up heart.
In the heat of the passion and good times is what i remember.
Seems they cant let go its holding me back
From how they only talk and bring up the bad parts of the past .
Its trash in the form of talk lady's nee to throw it out.
What big Calvin's bout?
Love loyalty honesty, Looking at what's wrote and how it turned out I cant believe.
Now I find it hard to trust.
Was in the land of the lost just got lust.
What the fuck?
Chorus x2
Shoebox so full
My hearts empty
Body full of stress
But what's next
Shoebox so full
My hears empty
Body full of stress
The letters,... Why I still keep them?
Maybe to find out there pattern, I did figure it out!
They don't want love just a man with more clout,
and a team of shit talkers convincing them I aint no good.
Just a normal man aint representing no hood.
Not a robber just an author
Speaking poetry to the sound of music.
Letters so confusing,...
Am I even a memory to them?
Not even still a friend.
Loss of contact all tho its to late to keep in touch,
Got so many letters it could keep me busy for months.
All the stunts and antic you figure I wouldn't fall for these tricks.
I'm soft in heart strong in mind,
So deceiving hart telling what when on when I was sleeping in my own bed.
It stained my feelings and the way I approach women.
I'm still living to them I must bee dead.
Probably had a fake funeral just to not show up.
I'm on the edge!
Chorus x4
Shoebox so full
My hearts empty
Body full of stress
But whats next
Shoebox so full
My hears empty
Body full of stress
I wonder sometimes how they could let it all go.
Letters seem so happy.
What exactly was on there mind?
I cant tell.
Never will able.
Lyrics running like water,
But they gone with the wind,
Stuck in sin.
Wishing a real woman would step up and throw them away.
Bring them better days.
I'm only 19 just don't want to get to where its to late.
Treat women like I'm casanova you just a pretender in vain.
Girls went from loving and innocent to insane.
For a few I acted the same way only during the break up.
In my mind I know most where sent only to make an illusion that I'm evil.
Not a show no encore.
They either get with the next man,
or go play someone else when there friend are wanting more.
What a sick thing to watch!
Some girls even made me lose my closest boys.
A game so funny they happy in misery I'm happy with nothing.

I see you everyday
And I can't seem to think of anything to say
To you, baby, how can it be
That breaks my heart when you're smiling at me
The moment that I laid my eyes on you (my eyes on you)
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true
Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night time
Girl you shine like the stars in the sky
In you I see something I won't find
Never again, baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart
The moment that I laid my eyes on you (my eyes on you)
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true
Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night time
Girl you shine like the stars in the sky
Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're gonna make my dreams come true
You know I'll never leave you, I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine
(Shine) shine (shine) shine on me
Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night time
Girl you shine like the stars in the sky
You're all I need to survive
And girl you keep me alive
And girl you shine like the sun in the sky

(verse)
I saw you
It was a rainy day in May or June
I couldn't help it
God, you looked so fine
I just had to make you mine, all mine
Well I'm a helpless fool for love
Instantly
I cannot eat nor sleep, no
Hard to breathe
You read my love so easy
A, be, see
Twist my mind around and 1, 2, 3
Then I'm a helpless fool for...
(chorus 1)
Ah...
When he walks (?)
When he talks
When he moves
Makes my day
I'm the helpless one
Ah...
Not unkind
I don't mind
When he talks
Just a rush
I'm a fool for love
(verse)
All shook up
I know it's stupid to precipitate
Without getting all humiliate
Didn't know what I should say or do
Everything I'll give to you and me (when I'm here without you)
We're gonna have a riot
Trust in me (I can't live without you)
I'm gonna make you happy
What you need (helpless fool without you)
I'll give you everything
I'll try to be (you know, you know, you know, you know, you know)
Still your helpless fool for...
(chorus 2)
Ah...
When he walks
When he talks
When he moves
Makes me feel
I'm a fool for love
Ah...
What a joy, you're my boy
And it seems like a dream
Now I'm all shook up
Ah...
Need you, Doctor Love
Are you there?
Every day I'm the helpless one
Ah...
Not unkind
I don't mind
When he talks
Just a rush
I'm a fool for love
I am a helpless fool for love
I am a helpless fool for love
I am a helpless fool for love
(chorus 2)
I am a helpless fool for love

Love and learn, they say we love and learn
Learn the facts of love
Each in his turn
Learn that love will soothe and love will burn
It will hurl you to heaven and then down again
Give you hope, give you heartbreak
Love and learn like me that love is strange
Sweet and bitter ride
That one and nothing can change it
Love and learn like me that love is strange
It will warm you in winter and chill in spring
Invade your nights then one day be gone
Love and learn so your heart may wiser be
Love and learn that love's mad, gay and sad, good and bad
Nothing like you've had but you can't
Heaven it seems
You give your love to your man
All the love that you can
Never do you dream
He will take it and go one day
Now you know all there is to know about
There you go
Wise to love but still without it
Love and learn that you learn
Not a thing at all

When I'm feeling down the mention of your name
It lifts my spirit up
It makes me carry on when I don't have the strength
Your faith can heal me
Like the sun that shines
You give me light to see
Catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love
Can you hear me calling to your heart?
'Cause you're the one, the reason I go on
Could I find the words to tell you how I feel
With one look from your eyes?
I know what heaven's worth so I'd sell everything
To hold and touch you
You're the air I breath
The reason my heart beats
Catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love
Oh, can you hear me calling to your heart?
'Cause you're the one, the reason I go on
The reason I go on, yeah
Baby, I'm just dreaming
But my hope, it keeps me strong
Oh, catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love
Oh, can you hear me calling to your heart?
'Cause you're the one, the reason I go on

Walking under the lion's gate
Bitter tears for a city's fate
Raise your voice in an ancient song
Say goodbye to Babylon
Hanging gardens with falling leaves
Temples robbed by the Persian thieves
Once this empire was standing strong
Say goodbye to Babylon
Never say never
Never forever
Always and ever
Always forever
Kingdoms dancing in nebu's dream
Ask the prophets what kingdoms mean
Count the battles our lord has won
Say goodbye to Babylon
Sacred sighs written on the wall
From above holy angels fall
Paradise where we all come from
Say goodbye to Babylon
Never say never
Never forever
Always and ever
Always forever
Xerxes tore every wall apart
Let our home with a broken heart
Blood in euphrat but life goes on
Say goodbye to Babylon
Life was good in the site of life
All that's left is eternal strife
Baby's riding a neutron bomb
Say goodbye to Babylon
Never say never
Never forever
Always and ever
Always forever

She's such a different girl, she looked at me
My head's in a whirl, she looked at me
Such a pretty face I don't know what to say
I hope she might even stay a while
Not to mention, not to mention her smile.
She just fascinates me, I must talk to her
She knows how to be, I must talk to her
She's makin' me feel I just can't go wrong
Her eyes say don't be too long, awhile
Not to mention, not to mention her smile.
Hello's an easy word to say, just be sociable
You know what I mean?
But I find her hard to play, she's unapproachable
Well, do you know what I mean?
I just can't concentrate, she makes me feel weak
I'll leave it too late, I just have to speak
There's nothing to lose if she dislikes me
Her eyes seem to tell me it's worthwhile
Not to mention, not to mention her smile.
Not to mention her smile.

Oh, so why not? Baby, why not?
Uh, uh, uh, I'm hot, baby, you're hot
No, no, oh, why not? So baby, why not?

Yea, yea, oh, why not? So baby, why not?
Uh, uh, uh, I'm hot, baby, you're hot
Oh, so why not? baby, why not?
Gazes meeting in the middle of a dance floor
My lips anticipating
Come here and move it, baby, show me what you're made for
Oh, so long that I've been waiting
I'm sweating bullets, baby, don't know what to do now
So hot in here, I'm fainting
Like little children, baby, waiting for the school bell
My fingers, finger painting
And I know you wanted me
My picture in a magazine
You know, I was lookin' at you
A table set just for two
I know you wanted me
My picture in a magazine
You know, I was lookin' at you
A table set just for two
And I know you wanted me
My picture in a magazine
You know, I was lookin' at you
A table set just for two
I know you wanted me
My picture in a magazine
You know, I was lookin' at you
A table set just for two
And I know you wanted me
My picture in a magazine
You know, I was lookin' at you
A table set just for two
And I know you wanted me
My picture in a magazine
You know, I was lookin' at you
A table set just for two

It should have been you
Could have been you
It should have been you
Could have been you
When we first got together
We thought our love would stand the test
Waiting, oh, so long
Can't settle for second best
No one else could make me feel the way you do
Broke my heart in two
When you said our love was through
It should have been you
Could have been you
It should have been you
Could have been you
Through pain, tears and heartache
We see our love can't last
It's time for new beginnings
Can't live in the past
With my back to the wind
I face a new horizon
Believe me when I say that it's true
Even though our love is through
Been searchin' such a long time
True love's so hard to find
Been searchin' such a long time
True love's so hard to find
No one else could make me feel
The way you do
Broke my heart in two
When you said our love was through
It should have been you
Could have been you
It should have been you
Could have been you
Been searchin' such a long time
Wonder when I'll ever find
A man so warm and true
Who loves me like you used to do

Baby
I can be your sweet baby
When things get crazy
Make sure you come and save me (save me)
Lil' miss fast car
I can really get far
And don't break my heart
Let's make out (Let's make out! Let's make out!)
You can come take me away
There's no pressure play all day
Hold me tight and don't let go!
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
Stuck in
The middle of it all
To many people around me
Can you hear me call?
I look this way
And you're not there
If you dont mind
My soul out there
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa
You can come take me away
There's no pressure play all day
Hold me tight and don't let go!
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papi
Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi
Mmm Luvi, Mmm Luvi, Mmm Papi
(You will always be there for me)
(You will always be there for me)
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You can come take me away
There's no pressure play all day
Hold me tight and don't let go!
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
Now see!
I'm mommy!
And that make you Papi!
And that makes us Luvi!
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa [Repeat: x3]

The wheels of life are turning so much faster
The restless hands of time pass me by
There are dreams I'll never live to see
But as long as you believe in me
I'll still feel them on the way
As I take life day by day
Oh the wheels of time are turning so much stronger
The blues of days gone by weigh me down
But maybe love will come to rescue me
And I'll never set you free
Like the sea runs to the shore
I've come back yo you once more
The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life keep turning round and round
And if I should only have one tomorrow
It's a lifetime if I knew
I could spend that day with you
Ooh, the wheels of love will turn my world forever
I want you in my arms for all time
And maybe love will come to rescue me
And I'll never ever set you free
Like the sea runs to the shore
I'll love you forever more
The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life
The wheels of life keep turning round and round
The wheels of life
The wheels of life keep turning so much faster
The wheels of life are turning so much stronger

We gather medicine for heartache
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah
The needle along the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you,
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn
To let it figure out
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
The bodies lying in the sand,
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us,
We feel it move through our skin
It's a sickness, a manic weakness, yeah

Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah
Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
You gave me butterflies
And then you shot them down
Straight out the sky
You make my heart take off
To kick it on the ground
You don't even try
You have got better options but you
Are all that I want is just you, you
Keep doing the things that you do
Got me like, why?
Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer
Obliterate my trust
Assassinate my dreams
You're nothing but cold
But baby I just know
That no one in the world
Could love you if I don't
You have got better options than you
And all of my friends they hate you, you
'Cause all of the things that you do
Got me like, why?
Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer
La-la-la la-la love
You want some more
I'm a love killer
La-la-la la-la love
You want some more
I'm a love killer
Why do I love you so much, yeah
Why do I love you so much
Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer
Why do I love you so much
When you're a love killer
Why do I give you my love
When you're a love killer
Baby, baby you're like the worst drug
But you're a buzz killer
You're a love, you're a love killer
I'm in love with the love killer

Spent the best of my life running scared
in the city
left my shoes and my clothes and
my lovers behind, yeah
oh but I felt incomplete
living out there in the street
I was always alone and afraid
such a pity
little girls just don't know what comes
out after dark
but the devil wasn't in here
down on that dead end street
And I say
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover
It's take keeping me running
I'm just scared that he's out tonight
it's keeping me running
I don't know why, but its getting dark
say the devil's in the park
and its already after dark
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover, now
Life is really so hard when you live in the city
no one know what a young girl
has on her mind, yeah
but you're headed for defect
down on that dead end street
Never learned of the lesson
you should, such a pity
Still and all you'll stay away
the others behind
and the promise in the dark
is that the devil's in the park
And I say
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover
It's take keeping me running
I'm just scared that he's out tonight
it's keeping me running
I don't know why, but its getting dark
say the devil's in the park
and its already after dark
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover
Spent the best of my life running scared
in the city
left my shoes and my clothes and
my lovers behind, yeah
oh but I felt incomplete
living out there in the street
running for cover
running for cover
running for cover
It's take keeping me running
I'm just scared that he's out tonight
it's keeping me running
I don't know why, but its getting dark
say the devil's in the park
and its already after dark

You're such a beautiful writer
That's not all you are
I'm sorry about making a pass
It was subtle but I think that you guess
The meaning intended
I can be a friend to you
I won't pretend
I'm not interested in breaking your heart
It's not love no it's nothing like that
I'll leave that to .. like him
Oh, he's such a delicate thing
Now it's such a fragile thing that we have
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class
We could go out dancing
But, in truth it is the last thing that I have on my mind
Just say if I'm way out of line
I won't need telling twice
Now he wants to kiss
He says he can't resist
You're going to have to keep it hidden inside
I have feeling that pigs might fly, might fly
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
You're such a beautiful writer
That's not all you are
I'm sorry about making a pass
It was subtle but I think that you guess
The meaning intended
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse
I should be suspended from class
I don't know my elbow from my arse

Truthdare doubledare
Gotta be careful who I meet tonight
Put up the struggle, I'll put up the fight
Loving is different, so full of fear
Can't love you right, until the cure is here
It's physical breakdown
It's emotional blackmail
It's uncontrollable it affects us all
Here I am dr john
Here I am do you know what to do
The papers report in the wrong way
Don't care what they say, they don't educate
People look on it with a different view
Can you help me, explain
Do you know what to do
Used to be careless and so carefree
That old life-style will be the death of me
Dreading the system in this modern age
It's killing our people, must try to be brave
There must be something we can do
It's catching up, breaking through
There falls a silence across our land
The situation's out of hand
The situation is out of hand
Do you know what to do

Remember me
A face you used to see
Not the same song that I used to be
I had their words passing through me
But I just can't find the rhymes
I've been every place but right so many times
[Chorus]
When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me
Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from
There's no place that I would rather be
Remember me
The girl who thought that she
Could get lost in unreality
I've been around up and down
I've never missed a single rhyme
I've been everything there is but satisfied
[Chorus: x2]
When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me
Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from

The past is all that's gone
The future is yet to come.
This moment is all our own.
We should live this way
Just building up our day
Now and forever.
The past is all that's gone
The future is yet to come.
This moment is all our own.
We should live this way
Just building up our day
Now and forever.
We should think about
What we got right now
'Cause the good things are made up of time.
Smile to your problems,
Leave the past behind.
Never forget this.
Find the truth in your soul,
Keeping you alive.
Going on from minute to minute.
Don't shade the future,
With all that's behind.
Live for today.
The past is all that's gone,
The future is yet to come.
This moment is all our own.
We should live this way,
Just building up our day,
Now and forever.
The past is all that's gone,
The future is yet to come.
This moment is all our own.
We should live this way,
Just building up our day,
Now and forever.
Don't shade your future,
With what you don't have.
Keep your mind on that's here today.
Now and forever,
Build the future now.
Keep this mind.
Though you will take your time,
To get what you need,
But you'll do it step after step.
Yet to come is all that's gone,
Learn to lice this moment.
Live for today.

Leaky faucet dripping in the kitchen
Rubber squealing - watch out in the alley
Mr. Marley's probably late for work again
Birdie singing - telling me to get up
Such a soothing sound floating on the wind
I just keep listening
Funny how You speak to me
In such mysterious ways
[Chorus]
I can hear You
I can hear You
It's so amazing how Your voice keeps breaking through
I can hear You
There's a church bell ringing out the hour
Like an old friend calling through my window
With the laughter of the children playing down below
You've got a way of getting my attention
In the rhythm of life, everywhere I go
Somehow You let me know
If I'll only stop to listen
You're in everything
[Repeat Chorus]
I can hear You
I can hear You
I can hear You
I can hear You
[Repeat Chorus]

Should I give you some, that is the question
And will it change the way you look at me
I have been so afraid while you've been so patient
My mother would have a fit if she could see...
You made a good good girl
Do a bad bad thing
Although my mind is strong
My body isn't listening
See I know right from wrong
But my heart won't speak (wont say nothing)
So should I stay a good good girl
Or do a bad bad thing
I'm burning incents and candles
I've planned it all perfectly
Now do you think you can handle
A massage from me, yea
Yes, I know it's unexpected
When love takes takes control
You've been naked
But I'm not afraid no more
I just want you to walk through that door
And make a good good girl
Do a bad bad thing
Although my mind is strong
My body isn't listening
See I know right from wrong
But my heart won't speak (wont say nothing)
So should I stay a good good girl
Or do a bad bad thing
Kissing you, feeling you (that's not so bad)
Touching you, holding you (that's not so bad)
Wanting you like I do (that's not so bad)
I've almost decided, I tried hard to fight it
I, I just might, I just might, give it to you
My mind is strong
My body isn't listening
See I know right from wrong
But my heart won't speak (wont say nothing)
So should I stay a good good girl
Or do a bad bad thing

Words and music by roddy frame
Now you're back in my arms again
Let your heart be rearranged
While you were sleeping the reaper's been reaping
The times have changed
Speak softly to me
You have more power than the bomb
The tears in your eyes are just medals and prizes
The war is over
Miracles will come and go watch it all work out
But don't give in
If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
What would would it matter if the world were to shatter
Is it the world you believe in
You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the scenery's caving in
On knees burnt by gravel the season's unravel
Your reason for living
With flesh and blood and small change
We start a little something new
Rather lead and be mistaken than following and fakin'
For the sake of seeming true
All the stars and satellites shine down on you
But which will you heed?
If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
What would would it matter if the world were to shatter
Is it the world you believe in?
You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the scenery's caving in
On knees burnt by gravel the season's unravel
Your reason for living
If I should drown in the light of your eyes
Well I'd rather die giving
Walk the line with some grace say it wasn't a race
Ain't that a reason for living?

You must think that I'm a fool this twisted tenderness just leaves me cool You've got me in a mess you know it's true out in the wilderness here without you
Right outside it's a cruel world something happening it's distracting you're just bad news girl
l Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true I will never let you down spread this message all around that I hope and that I pray you can turn my life around
Take a look out there we're under house arrest and you don't care We could always be friends but you were careless right till the end I feel guilty oh it's such a shame it's frustrating it's a sad thing and there's no one else to blame Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true
I won't ever let you down spread this message all around that I hope and that I pray you won't take my love to town Tell a little lie tell a little lie that's all you have to do is tell a little lie tell a little lie tell a little lie Don't you know it's true Right outside It's a cruel world something happening it's distracting you're just bad news girl Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true I will never let you down spread this message all around That I hope and that I pray you won't take my love to town Tell a little lie tell a little lie that's all you have to do is tell a little lie tell a little lie tell a little lie don't you know it's true don't you know it's true don't you it's true don't you know it's true.

Now what do you wana do
Ah, yea come on, Another Level
Verse 1
Why you wana come around and step upon my scene
You tried to playa hate, but you ain't gon' play me
What you looking for
Something to floor
The talent that you see
Get a hold of yourself
Find something else
Stop tryna be me
Bridge
Why would you think you could walk in my shoes
You can take inspiration but don't break the rules
Chorus
Now let me make this real clear
I don't know what you could want from me
I'm asking you just let me be
There's nothing left to see here
Can't you see there's something wrong
I'm telling you to move along
Verse 2
Everybody's talking like they best friends with me
Just because they see me on the D-V-D
On the radio
I'm good to go
When I'm home alone
Like to take it slow
Sit back relax
Let my interests grown
That's just the way I flow
Bridge
Chorus
Verse 3 (Dane)
I'm just an ordinary guy
With tendencies to be shy
Why you think I'm so cool
Don't you think, that I could be
Just like you
I'm just me
Chorus
(dane)
Sitting in the club
I know you know my name
You step to me
Like I'm the one to blame
You don't know
I'm just the same
As you and him, and his friend and his woman (o yeah)
Chorus

i'm at the mall, i'm cutting school
and it's the middle of the day
i'm in the spencers,
but i'm scoping on the girls over at rave
that's when I saw you,
with an orange julius in your left hand
I walked right up to you and told you I was in a synthpop band.
i'll be your chess king
he'll do anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll wear anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll do anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll wear anything
you're looking sassy and you know it cause you sport the benetton
you walk right past me and don't show it but you want to get it on
hiding in the food court I know that I may not get a second chance
i've got a car, i've got drakkar and now i'm looking for romance
i'll be your chess king
he'll do anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll wear anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll do anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll wear anything
first floor, you tell me that you like me
outside the esprit
second floor, you tell me that you need me
oh you're so heavenly
third floor, you tell me you desire me
it's you I adore
fourth floor, you tell me that you love me
my heart starts to soar
you wanna meet me, z cavaricci, i'll be there
you lose the scrunchie then you spray some aussie in your fluff-chick hair
i've got the new kon kan cassingle blastin on my stereo
you grab me by the hand and whisper in my ear "it's time to go"
i'll be your chess king
he'll do anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll wear anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll do anything
i'll be your chess king
he'll wear anything...

I can see in your eyes
Broken windows, fallen skies
Baby, baby what you hidin' from
The light that followed you around
Lately nowhere to be found
Don't you know that I'm your place to run
You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know
That you can let go
Sifting through shattered dreams
Livin' in the in between
Baby, babe it's gonna be alright
(You can let go)
When you're lost, let down, disappointed
And jerked around in this cold, cold world
I will always be by your side
You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
There ain't nothin' you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know
That you can let go
Don't be afraid when you're falling apart
Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes there's a crack in the dark
Never let me see you cry
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby let me hold you tight
Make it alright
Baby, baby gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you (I won't turn against you)
Not letting it show
Baby, babe gonna be alright
Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
You can let go
You been holding on so long
Tryin' to make believe that nothing's wrong
Not letting it show
You can let go
There ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know

Swore I saw my true reflection
In the city lights at midnight
Fragments of a life led searching
Settle in a mess of color
The hills at dawn with your cool dark daughter
Gazing down on the glittering water
Got a feeling that your favorite son
Must've known stone loneliness
I see the sea's horizon
Bend and sympathize with the blue sky
Sun burst and shatter
Throw your light across the square
Be my guide and take me there
Back to the one
Shadows scatter
Place towers at my feet
Lead me down through every street
Back to the one
Rise and toast the devil in you
Feel him catch his stride with angels
Chatterin' rails and cracklin' wires
Coast to coast deliver love and war
Honey from the bay of plenty
Soothes the northern voice of anger
Crashin' waves 'neath the flash of storm
Trash the skies and it must be love
I feel my soul's horizons
Stretch in sympathy with her smile
Sun burst and shatter
Throw your light across the square
Be my guide and take me there
Back to the one
Shadows scatter
Place towers at my feet
Lead me down through every street
Back to the one

Staring in the mirror as I
Start to carefully contemplate
Just really how deep is this thing I have for you
It's wearing on my heart
And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turn to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange stuttering
On every word when you look my way, why?
And maybe it's all in my mind
But when we hugged goodbye I had butterflies
I just died, yeah
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
Your finger touched my lips
As I tried to explain maybe why you
And I should hide from such a love affair
My friends think that I'm so insane to fight this feeling,
But my life's at stake
Your embrace, thoughts won't erase
Every now a minute of the day I wait
And hope and pray that you might stay
And now you're moving oh so closely
Killing me so softly, so softly
I just died
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight

Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking,
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Keep thinking,
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking,
Keep thinking, I had to pay the price

A man like you, a man like you
Could be my new beginning
And get me on the winning side of life
If I had you, a man like you
All the fairy tales I dreamed about
Just a breath ago would all come true
If I had you baby
If I had a man like you
A man like you baby, just like you
I'd share all of the precious things
That I've been saving deep within my soul
Well a man like you, and baby
A little ol' sweet girl like me
The two of us together
Ride the waves forever and we'll be home free
Well don't you feel it, yeah
I need a man like you
And all I want is to know
I need you by my side yeah
And I want to protect you baby
From all things in life
Well I do, yeah

Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to everyone out there
Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen
Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her
So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words
From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in
She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah
I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same
Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls
These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it
From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words
Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us
I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites
And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone
She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself
She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love
Or at least I thought it was love, yeah
Ooh, on and on
She wasn't good at all
She wasn't good at all, yeah, yeah
I said I'm glad she's out of my life

It never rained, the sun was always shining
Every traffic light was always green
There was a time when every door was open
The universe was mine..or so it seemed
Ever roll was seven or eleven
That it would ever end never crossed my mind
I was flying higher than the heavens
Back when the world was mine
Sometimes a man can't see
When he has it all
Take a look at me
Oh how he mighty fall
Once I ruled the earth
Once upon a time
When I had your love
When the world was mine
Oh the changes I'd make if I had the power
How could I have so much and be so blind
But at least for a bright and shining moment
I had you, and the world was mine
[CHORUS]

i would wrap my arms around you, tell you now that things would be ok. i'd make you feel so unsurrounded. until you felt the recklessness slip away. everytime i look at you, you look away. it's amazing the things we could do, the things we could accomplish one day. on the uptown subway you frown 'cause you missed out again. a message for the attendent, you've only got a dollar. looking out across the water, up and down the alleyway. you just need a dollar to ride the subway train. the uptown subway...

Cornelius:
It only takes a moment
For your eyes to meet and then
Your heart knows in a moment
You will never be alone again
I held her for an instant
But my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long...
Clerk:
I missed a few words back there, mr. hackl.
Right after 'it only'...
All in docket:
...takes a moment!
But his arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment
Mrs. molloy:
He held me for an instant
But his arms felt safe and strong
It only takes a moment
To be loved a whole life long
Cornelius:
And that is all
That love's about
Mrs. molloy:
And we'll recall when time runs out
Both:
That it only took a moment
To be loved a whole life long!

I opened the door to your head
Tried going quietly
But the door slammed instead
I yelled, why'd I even come here?
But still I stayed for a while
Looked in every drawer that I could find
Saw your calender on the floor
You're not very organized, are you?
I said to myself, I said to myself
You should go, you should leave
Won't stop pulling on my sleeve
But I stood there, I stood there
With a note from my head
Opposite of what my heart said
Oh, I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I went through all your dirty laundry
Even all your smelly socks
I wonder where, where those even came from
I saw everything you had lying around
From your deck of cards to the
Way you feel about me just lying on the ground
I said to myself, I said to myself
You should go, you should leave
Won't stop pulling on my sleeve
But I stood there, I stood there
With a note from my head
Opposite of what my heart said
Oh, I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I said to myself, I said to myself
You should go, you should leave
Won't stop pulling on my sleeve
But I stood there, I stood there
With a note from my head
Opposite of what my heart said
Oh, I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
Oh, I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know

I remember one girl
Saw her again in a magazine
Front cover, big star
Showing things that I'd never seen
Well maybe
Can you feel it? Can you?
I remember one girl
Who'd believe she'd be so devious
Bad decision, bad move
She told the papers everything
Well maybe
Do you need it, do you?
Do you want it, do you?
Come and get it
I remember one girl
She'd only make friends in expensive cars
Television, good wine
Leather seats and a friend of mine
Well maybe
Something's coming
Oh no

Rock star, sing my song
Be my brand new toy

A fallen poster boy
Rock star, sing my song

The twelve of you walked on the earth together
The father was a brother to you all
The teaching that you heard was the Living Word
The wonders and the miracles you saw
There were times of awesome inspiration
There were times you didn't understand
And when He had to go and you felt alone
It must have been so hard to see His plan
I think about the way you carried on
In the face of persecution you stood strong...
[Chorus]
I will follow Christ
I will run the race
Fighting the good fight
Standing on my faith
I will wear the name of Jesus
I will give Him all my life
As for me no matter what the sacrifice
I will follow Christ
Now I don't have to look across the ages
His voice is speaking in my heart today
His Word is like a flame consuming all my shame
His life a shining star to show the way
[Chorus]
I behold Your life and see the man You want me to become
Living like someone whose heart belongs to the kingdom
That was sealed on Calvary
I will show the world what I believe
I will follow Christ
I will run the race
Fighting the good fight
Standing on my faith
I will wear the name of Jesus
I will give Him all my life
As for me no matter what the sacrifice
I will follow Christ

It's a long way home, but I'm making my way
With so many things still left to say
But I try to think about the one I need the most
When my mind turns black
And then it hits me like a ton of bricks
I love you, not nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart
I always wanted you, sometimes it's hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
Nothing says tomorrow is a guarantee
There's no way of knowing that you'll be with me
As I walk upon the edge of no escape
In the world so flat
And then it hits me like a bolt of faith
I love you, not nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart
I always wanted you, sometimes it's hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up
We won't stay, we run
Love like melting suns
Please don't leave, don't run
Why don't you stay in tonight?
Taste my lips, don't let go
I'm in your head
I'm in your head
I'm in your head
I always wanted you, sometimes it's hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up
I want to lock you up inside my heart

Here I walk, here I walk
Looking for an angel's wings in the den of the hawk
Here I am, here I am
With a choice between an also ran and a sunbed tan
And you thought you'd found your own little look
How I misjudged, how I mistook
And you thought you'd found the style of your hair
I guess tonight I'll take, I'll take these troubles to
the rocking chair
So I'll take these high-heeled shoes
And yes I'll take these traditional views
I'll take this deep despair
Of a 30 year old square, to the rocking chair
Here I sit, here I sit
Looking for a warming smile in a house of cold wit
Here I stand, here I stand
Torn between the balding drunk and no man's land
And they'll tell you when you've reached your peak
Where the wolf-whistle rung there's a deafening shriek
Blowing kisses into thin air
I guess tonight I'll take, I'll take these troubles to
The rocking chair
So I'll take this awkward stance
And I'll take this sexless dance
I'll take this deep despair of a 30 year old square
To the rocking chair
Am I skinny? A shade too fat?
Mmm, my friend the cat knows all about that
Am I happy?
(Here I sit, here I sit)
Just a little sad
(Looking for a warming smile in a house of cold wit)
Mmm, my friend the cat knows all about that
Am I skinny?
(Here I walk, here I walk)
A shade too fat?
(Looking for an angel's wings in the den of the hawk)
My friend the cat knows all about that

Like a bolt from the blue, descending from the sky
My brain collapses in the dead of night
Too much for my psyche, another crack-up
If you're awake, join me
All the things you see, the same as what I see
We listen to the sound of nervous breakdown
A death that blends with a will to live
One of the things that freaks me out
I'm waiting for a sign, have to leave this place behind
Where no one knows my name
Then later we'll calm down, we'll both break down and cry
(And say) our last goodbye.(instr.)
I'll break the chains, I'm out of line
I'm living on my nerve, last days of ninety-nine
Nightmare, conspiracy, depression and lunacy
I need to feel, walled up inside
Locked up, messed up, maybe there is no tomorrow
All this thinking does me no good
I'll miss you my love, but it's about time
That this world goes up in flames.

As we dip and slide so cool, to the rhythm
Let the magic magic happen, sing along
Dressin' up, sexy people having fun
Shoes is new, don't scuff 'em up
Take your time and enjoy yourself

[Chorus]
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day
But that never mattered too much to me
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything
Some people think I'm aggressive
'Cause I know what I want
But that never mattered too much to me
Show me some body with no goal
Show me some body with no control
'Cause life is for living
So go and get it
When times get rough remember
[Chorus]
Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Ohh gotta get it
Hey hey hey
Sometimes the road may seem too far
You never really know for sure
If you're ever gonna make it
Sometimes the end may seem so far
You never really know for sure
If you got the strength to make it
But you gotta remember
[Chorus]
Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
Days like this
Rain like this
Do it 'cause I love it
Feel like this
Gotta work hard for it

I wanna touch you
I wanna hold you
I wanna feel your hands and hear you say
I wanna touch you
Wanna hold you
I'm yours forever one more day
'Cause tonight there's only love
Nothing else should be sad
Cause tonight there's only peace
A naked sleep, in a naked bed
I wanna touch you
I wanna hold you
Wanna feel the weight and hear you say
I want you to touch me
I want you to hold me
You're mine forever one more day
'Cause tonight there's only love
Nothing else, don't forget
Cause tonight there's only peace
A naked sleep In naked beds
Saved from loneliness
I reach to touch your face
I meet the soulty taste of you
Fear might never rest
But I won't go for less
I will go for more too
Wanna touch you
Wanna hold you
I'm yours forever one more day
Wanna touch you
Wanna be with you
A naked sleep in naked beds.
I

Ayo mo bee
Drop it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's do it like this, uh
If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeah
She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall
'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
Yeah, yeah
Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind
You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman

Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
The lovers hold on to everything
And others hold on to anything
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
(And then you take it all away)
Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me
I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone
But lovers hold on to everything
And others hold on to anything
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
So, Lovers hold on to everything
And others hold to anything
So, Lovers hold on to everything
And others hold to anything
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
(And then you take it all away)

Strophe 1:
Sometimes when I start life to measure,
I think about the things I wish I'd done.
Who knows if there'll be any treasure
To last beyond the fading of the sun?
Though sometimes I may fear
I've lived in vain.
I search for answers here
While I remain.
Refrain:
For the truth lies in open skies and down by the sea.
I will lay down, my soul is found, my spirit set free.
Strophe 2:
Sometimes when I start life to measure,
I think about the things I wish I'd said.
Mere words can change the course forever
And fill the soul with life or deep regret.
Though sometimes I may fear
What have I done.
I know my journey here
Has just begun.
For the truth lies in open skies and down by the sea.
I will lay down, my soul is found, my spirit set free.
For the truth lies in open skies and down by the sea. I will lay down, my soul is found, my spirit set free.
For the truth lies in open skies and down by the sea. I will lay down, my soul is found, my spirit set free.
For the truth lies in open skies and down by the sea. I will lay down, my soul is found, my spirit set free.
For the truth lies in open skies and down by the sea. I will day down, my soul is found, my spirit set free...

Do you deal in black money?
Do you deal in black money, do you deal in?
Do you deal in black money?
Do you deal in black money, do you deal in? Oh yeah
Fortunes find you cross out every emotion
Standing right behind a shadow of devotion
Somebody else's life cannot be mine
But when you love someone and they don't love you in return
When you love someone, you've got money to burn
Do you deal in black money?
Do you deal in black money, do you deal in?
Do you deal in black money?
Do you deal in black money, do you deal in? Oh
I believe that nothing could come between us
Magic potions, won't you save them for dreamers
Somebody else's life cannot be mine

Violins played by the wind are crying
Softly the silvery rain is sighing
Slowly the flame of our love is dying
It rains on our love, and we must part
Ciao, ciao, Bambina, the rain is falling
Once more I kiss you and then goodbye
Our love was just like a fairy story
But all its glory must pass us by
Are raindrops trembling upon your face, dear
Or are they teardrops for the love we knew?
Ciao, ciao, Bambina, my heart is calling
While rain is falling I cry with you
Ciao, ciao, Bambina, the rain is falling
Once more I kiss you and then goodbye
Our love was just like a fairy story
But all its glory must pass us by
Are raindrops trembling upon your face, dear
Or are they teardrops for the love we knew?
Ciao, ciao, Bambina, my heart is calling
While rain is falling I cry with you

Walk right through my soul, keep out the cold
And make me lose control, fill me with love
My mind is blazing and we're escaping the real world
Swing and sway on Lunar Bay, yeah, on Lunar Bay, yeah
Touch my very soul makes me lose control
My dreams unfold, you fill me with love
Feel me walking in the sun
Hear me talking to the moon
I won't change for anyone
I'm just for you, hey yeah
I touch my very soul, it makes me lose control
My dreams unfold, you fill me with love
The train of faces are going places, get on board
Swing and sway on Lunar Bay, yeah, on Lunar Bay, yeah
Swing and sway, swing and sway
Feel me walking in the sun
Hear me talking to the moon
I won't change for anyone
I'm just for you
When the wind rushes in to herald the king
Just stay in my heart forever more
Feel me walking in the sun
I won't change for anyone
When the wind rushes in to herald the king
Just stay in my heart forever more
In the sun, I won't change for anyone
In the common age of automation
Where people might eventually work ten or twenty hours a week
Man, for the first time will be forced to confront himself
With the true spiritual problems of living

Songs my mother taught me
In the days long vanish'd
Seldom from her eyelids
Were the teardrops banish'd
Now I teach my children
Each melodious measure
oft the tears are flowing
oft they flow from my mem'ry treasure

The road full of light
I have mine
Full of desire
In all of the world
There is a big mountain
Full of green daffodils
Swimming in the coldest part of spring
In light of it all
It comes pouring
Some going this way and others that
And straight down the track
You can hear 'em all falling
The road full of light
I have mine
Full of desire
In the light of it all
I have gone

Umm hmm
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking step into the sun
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, eat or be eaten
Some say, live and let live
But, all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap by faith
It's the band of hope
Till, we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life
Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps the great and small on the endless round
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap by faith
It's the band of hope
Till, we find our place
On the path unwinding, yea
In the circle
The circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune, yea
It's the leap by faith
It's the band of hope
Till, we find our place
On the path unwinding, yea
In the circle
The circle of life
On the path unwinding, yea
In the circle
The circle of life

I'll be a life size
cutout of all your faults
open up your wounds
I will be the salt
no intermission
no time to rest
this is the real thing
this is not a test
chorus
you're the elusive drug
that keeps me from myself
when I reach for you
you're healing someone else
an addiction comes so sudden
oh, it comes so sweet
the elusive drug has me beat
your the epitome of
what you hate about me
you inspire me
to be more like you
and it pleases me
to see you so frustrated
growing intimidated, agitated
cause I'm just like you
chorus
and you pick on my imperfections
and you put 'em out on show
you're well worn crown of compliments
I will never know
chorus out

There's a frost on the fields and a chill to the night
Where the vixen screams and the dog fox fights
And all the world is lying still
In silent ease and frozen will.
There's a change in the season and a change in you
From the girl I wanted to the one I knew
And I've grown tired of trying to save her
And trying to reach the climate of your favour.
Ice on the water, snow in the sky
Darkness falls to the night owl's cry
And all the world is sleeping still
In silent ease and frozen will.
There's a change in the season and a change in you
From the time we started to the time we're through
And I've grown tired of trying to save her
And trying to reach the climate or your favour.
INSTRUMENTAL
Yes I've grown tired of trying to save her
And trying to reach the climate or your favour.

They were the sweetest words I'd ever heard
My heart could barely take it in
Like water offered to the lips
Of a tired and thirsty man
'cause it's a tangled web of woven
I don't know all the reasons
But it amazes me to wake up
To your mercy every morning
So I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive and reaching out
And I can feel the healing
'cause you say
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come onout
Into the light
There is no jury
There is no judge
Ready and waiting
Are the steady arms of love 124
For the sake of never making waves I
Kept my secrets to myself
And no one ever really knew the
Darker shadows of my heart
But I will be a witness
That there's nothing in me dark enough
The power of forgiveness
Cannot resuce from the deep
So I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive and reaching out
And I can feel the healing
And you say
Come on out come out
Come on out come out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the light
There is no jury
There is no judge
Ready and waiting
Are a steady arms of love 240
Hey
And I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive
And reaching out
And I can feel the healing
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out

Stranded at the drive in, branded a fool
What will they say Monday at school?
Sandy, can't you see I'm a misery
Made a start now we're apart, there's nothing left for me
Love has flown all alone, I sit and wonder why, oh, why?
You left me, oh, Sandy
Oh, Sandy baby, someday when High School is done
Somehow, someway our two worlds will be one
In heaven forever and ever we will be
Oh, please say you'll stay, oh, Sandy
Said, Sandy my darling, you hurt me real bad
You know it's true but baby, you gotta believe me when I say
I'm helpless without you, love has flown all alone
I sit and wonder why, oh, why you left me, oh, Sandy?

She cries, she crumples up all the papers
All the meetings, all the records of the things she had paid for
And tries, to make herself feel better
But the rhythm of her mind is making her more nervous
"Why does my heart work so loud?"
Draws her curtains
And takes a look around
[And right now I just need to forget
So I don't feel this fire in my chest
'Cause I'll hold this close to me
I don't fear the end
And as I move I wonder
How am I here again?]
How am I here again?
She cries, and all the beauty that makes her
All the feelings, all the tragedies, and people that failed her
And tries, to make herself feel better
But the rhythm of her mind is coming out to get her
"Why does my heart work so loud?"
Draws her curtains
And takes a look around
[And right now I just need to forget
So I don't feel this fire in my chest
'Cause I'll hold this close to me
I don't fear the end
And as I move I wonder
How am I here again?]
I don't fear the end
And as I move I wonder
How am I here again?

Leaves everywhere outside your house
Running after you 'cause you walk too fast
And we can't find a cab
Looks like the Northern line again
Remember that time outside your room
Playing with the cat just me and you
It was my favorite time
My world stopped for just an hour
I am the voice
But not the sound
I can go up
Yet still be down
And you don't know the places that I've been to
You wouldn't like me if you knew
(What you gonna do when it all breaks down?
What you gonna do when you lose the sound?)
Don't remind me I cannot say
(What happened to the fire that got you through?
The days when nothing went right to you?)
Hey! nothing changed I'm still the same
Hey boy what's the score don't you give a shit
About yourself no more?
If you don't want me to be real don't look up to me
There are three saints that shaped my life
Alban, Bede and Mary
I've nothing but disrespect for them
And for what they almost made me
Those who taught, taught what they were taught
and not what they had learned
Sister I can't feel what you feel let me try
Brother lay your arms down and open your eyes
I believe in love (wow!)
Laugh if you must
I don't care...
'Cause I don't dare

Wherever I go, whatever I see
Over oceans unknown, you are always with me
Pure as the water, we float on this wave
On the breath of an angel, I'll fly away
At the ends of your fingers
I follow tonight
Caught in the lighting
Of a thousand horizons
We dance for no reason
You hold on so tight
Lost in the feeling
Of a wonderful ride
Di semua bahasa
Semua warna
Kupahami kata
Yang kau ukir indah
Nyanyi beku angin
Cairkan sengat suria
Di relung hatiku
Bernyanyi bidadari
I can hear every word
I see everywhere
Take me into your world
You can answer my prayers
Rivers of hours
Where time is so rare
Hold me forever
Say you'll always be there
Wherever I go, whatever I see
Over oceans unknown, you are always with me
Pure as the water, we float on this wave
On the breath of an angel, I'll fly away

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Girls like you give girls a bad name
Trying to get a boy but you sound so lame
Thinking it's cute to act real dumb
But the jokes on you, you stupid hun
Hold up, you're making no sense
You're talking out your ass
Like a waffle head, you bobblehead
Just keep your trap shut like your mama said
Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
But wait, like I don't get it
He, he, ha I don't care what you looking at?
Body so skinny but your head's so fat
Talky, talky, talky but you don't say shit
Got a way with words, you give me nothing, bitch
Banging on the door, nobody else there
You nightmare on Elm Street got everybody scared
Making me wanna run when you coming around
Because it's a frightening sound
Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
But wait, like, like what like, like what?
I don't get it, like what, what really?
Hanging with the girls makes you feel unsure
So you hang with the boys, makes you feel secure
Act all catty 'cause you hate competition
Bobble like a sheep on your airhead mission
Laugh in you face but behind your back
They say "I kinda like her booty but the girl is whack"
You see the boys, the boys they love me
Think you're a pain in your butt? Know what? You're crazy.
Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
And the real girls all say I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top
I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top
I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top
I never play dumb
To get what I want
And always come out the one
That's on top
I donâ??t get it

It's one year together
And I loved you right from the start
There's nothing that's better
And nothing to keep us apart
Now I wanna tell you
How special your love is to me
Cause this is our night
Gonna make it just right
And show you how love's gonna be
Chorus:
I'll take care of you
When you want me to
And do the things you want to do
If you stay with me
I'll give constantly all the lovin' you wanted from me
This is my promise to you,
From my heart and my soul this is true
Bring you happiness
Give you all the rest
Spend all my time on you
This is my promise to you,
Darling nothing will ever hurt you
Cause your happiness is my happiness
I'll always, forever be true
This is my promise to you
Oh, yes, I remember
There were days when nothing seemed right
I needed somebody
Needed someone to share my life (share my life)
But I never dreamed about a lady like you loving me(lady like you loving me)
But now everyday, I thank God as I pray
For sending my angel to me

You're running in the night hiding from the light of day
You say you're fine but I know better
'Cause you would never act that way.
If something wasn't wrong
if something wasn't out of control
And though you don't seem all
that different than everybody else I know
Coming from you
that's nothing but strange behavior
What you're going through
causing that strange behavior - so strange !
Something isn't right
something's got you under it's spell
And I would not be so suspicious if I didn't laiow you so well.
You might as well confess
you know that I'm gonna find out
So just don't keep on acting
like you don't know what I'm talking about.
Coming from you
that's nothing but strange behavior
. . .
It's so strange - you don't even talk to me
Now you've changed - you're nothing like you used to be.
Talk to me - talk to me !
Coming from you
that's nothing but strange behavior
. . .
Coming from you
that's nothing but strange behavior
. . .
Strange - talk to me ! (8x)

Just say we can
Say we can
Say yes
We can
Just say we can
Say we can
Say yes
We can
I'm the type who takes love literally
If it's there I take it to the max
So if this is a propositioning
I recommend you understand the facts
Are you just posing
As a dream
The silly games
That people scheme
Just say we can
Say we can
Say yes
We can
Just say we can
Say we can
Say yes

I like romance to spell tomorrow
Just want a thrill I'll read a book, yeah
So if it's a good time you're after
I suggest you take another look
Oh the things
We put ourselves through
So we can find out
Who should be with you
Just say we can
Say we can

Listen, in my time I've seen them all
Go and come
Come and go
Listen, passing through revolving doors
Could it be
What I'm really waiting for
Just say we can
Say we can
Say yes

Take the time to know,
how alone you are in this world
just to find
death is on your mind
as you stand still, you realize where you are
in her world
aged and bright,
my moon after the tide
How was I to show
for the time I spend alone
in my head
the world nobody knows
as I lay still, your wind carried the clouds
to feel
slow and kind
my moon after the tide

People buzzing around,
They don't know a thing
They just a laugh
And the ones in power are always pulling the strings
People do what they do,
How much can they take
They just get the news
And the ones in power always get the cake
But you got ambition,
You got the face, come on, let's go to a dangerous place
You got the class, I think you're desperate,
Let's go to a dangerous place
Come on, let's go, come on,
Let's go, come on
I promise this thing will sell,
I promise I'll take you to heaven
I promise this thing will sell, and I just can't wait
You have your plans, all these plans
And there are moments,
Shall I call them a chance
If I was you I would make them all mine
And if I ain't got the power I would commit a crime
But you got ambition
I promise this thing will sell
I'm gonna make you a deal,
You know I'm your friend
I'm gonna stay with you until the very end
I know you got the guts,
I got a lot of time
I'm gonna make me yours
Before I make you mine

Oh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ooh
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ooh
I was lonely, searching for love
Come set me free
Oh so lonely
I can't control this emotion
This feeling inside of me
Then lately there must be a reason
'Cause love has come to me
Oh, so tell me if you are the one
I'm gonna surrender
Oh, you gotta take all of me
Are you really the one, uh, eh
The one for me, uh uh uh
Can this be the one
Were you sent for me
I was wondering is this for real
Or simply just a dream
You made me open my eyes
Now my world is on fire, uh
Maybe you are the reason
Why love has come to me
Oh, so tell me if you are the one
I'm gonna surrender
Oh, you gotta take all of me
Are you really the one, yeah, yeah
The one for me
The only one for me
Can this be the one
Were you sent for me
Oh, will you be there till the end
On you can I depend (can I depend)
Baby, tell me
Will you be there by my side
Tell me you're the only one
Are you really the one, are you, are you
The one for me
The only one for me
Can this be the one
Were you sent for me
Were you sent for me, sent for me
Are you really the one
Are you the one for me
The one who really loves me
Can this be the one
Were you sent for me
Were you, I really gotta know, baby
(Can I depend)
Oh whoa oh oh oh
Are you really the one, yeah, yeah
The one for me
The only one for me
Can this be the one
Were you sent for me (were you sent for me)
Were you sent for me, baby, oh oh oh whoa
(Are you really the one)
Oh, I really wanna know (the one for me)
Really wanna know
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Can this be the one) can this be the one
(Were you sent for me) oh oh baby, were you sent for me
(Are you really the one)
Ah ah ah ah ah
(The one for me) ah ah, hey
(Can this be the one) ah baby
(Were you sent for me) were you, were you sent for me, baby
(Are you really the one)

It's just one more day
No one said
There would be rain again
Won't blame it on myself
I'll blame it on the weatherman
Get away for a while
Here I am out on my own again
Won't blame it on myself
I'll blame it on the weatherman
Standing on the shore
Calling out your name
I was here before
I could see your face
Only clouds will see
Tears are in my eyes
Empty like my heart
Why do ya say goodbye
The rain goes on(on and on again)
The rain goes on(on and on again)
Alone I can hear
Hear our song
Playing for me again
Won't blame it on myself
Just blame it on the weatherman
Standing on the shore
Calling out your name
I was here before
I could see your face
Only clouds will see
Tears are in my eyes
Empty like my heart
Why do ya say goodbye
The rain goes on(on and on again)
The rain goes on(on and on again)
Alone I can hear
Hear our song
Playing for me again
Won't blame it on myself
Just blame it on the weatherman
Maybe it's too late
Maybe it's too late to try again
Maybe I can pray
Maybe I can wait
Maybe I can blame it on the weatherman
The rain goes on(on and on again)
The rain goes on(on and on again)
Won't blame it on myself
Just blame it on the weatherman
Oh blame it on the weatherman

If I, I get to know your name
Well if I, could trace your private number, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some
I set my sights on you (and no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out here I come
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
I got to be your friend now, baby
And I would like to move in just a little bit closer
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
I want your love
I want your love
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

Blue System Magic Symphony lyrics
Breaking down the fences, breaking down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat, mystery is a fool
I talk to my dream
I hear a voice, it was calling
And I couldn't stop to steam
'Cause my wild horse was falling
Give me freedom in my dreams
Give me shelter, yes it seems
Bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'till I die
It's a magic symphony
Baby, when you're lying next to me
I hear violins
You know what it means just for tonight
I hear a symphony of love
I see the stars, the moon above
I hear your heart, I feel your touch deep down inside
Breaking down the fences, breaking down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat, mystery is a fool
I talk in my sleep
It was a mystic tune, devotion
I hear the rhythm beat
Unknown soldiers in devotion
Give me freedom in my dreams
Give me shelter - yes it seems
Bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'till I die

You're poised and ready
Unable to make a sound
Your hands are sweaty
As you look down
You're running already
When you hit the ground
You're willing and able
So nice to have around
The head of the table
Is tightly wound
The noise is loud
So turn it down
When you think about it
Try to wrap your head around it
You find none of it
Makes any sense at all
And people you once trusted
Are now looking so disgusted
And they're waiting anxiously
For you to fall
You take for granted
And take what you can grab
Fore say what's landed
Into your lap
You shake the hand
And take a stab
And there's no need to doubt it
There's never been
Two ways about it
It takes a thick skin
There's ways around it
But no way in
When you think about it
Try to wrap your head around it
You find none of it
Makes any sense at all
And people you once trusted
Are now looking so disgusted
And they're waiting anxiously
For you to fall
And there you go
Telling everybody you know
Selling a one man show
So take a look around you now
And soak it up and take a bow
You're living and crawling
And trying to catch a breath
You're stalling and dying
A sudden death
And all the while
You second guess
Oh, oh yeah
Ooh ooh ooh
Oh now the time has come
For it to stop
The clown was done
So call a cop
You're like a boy
In a china shop
You're poised and ready
Unable to make a sound
Your hands are sweaty
As you look down
You're running already
When you hit the ground

It's just the little things, the incidentals,
It's like you wouldn't even notice when you really turn me on,
It's the little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite,
It's just, it's just the simple things, pure incidentals,
It's like stayin' up 'till midnight and talkin' about absolutely nothing
It's the thought that it'll always be as wild as I expect it to be, yeah
Oh, you know it's la la la la love, when you dream,
A monster just swallowed you up and you don't wanna be saved
Oh and I am crazy about you babe,
You satisfy me in so many ways, so many ways
But it's just the little things, the incidentals (bada ba bup)
It's like you wouldn't even notice when you were really turnin' me on,
It's those little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite,
It's just, it's just the simple things, pure incidentals,
It's like breathin' on the back of my neck and makin' me feel weak inside.
It's no, no matter how scared I, scared I am (I'm safe) I know I'll be safe tonight (yeah yeah)
Oh, you know it's la la la la love, when you dream,
A monster just swallowed you up and you don't wanna be saved
Oh and I am crazy about you babe,
You satisfy me in so many ways, so many ways,
Mmm, so many ways, I can't count the ways.
(Oh, oh)
(Bada ba bup)
(Oh, oh)
It's the thought that it'll always be as wild as I expect it to be
And it's just the little things, pure incidentals,
It's like you wouldn't even notice when you were really turnin' me on,
It's those little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite yeah, (yeah yeah)
It's those little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite, yeah

chorus)
Baby take the rain away
Make it come again some other day
Let's pretend everything's ok
Baby take the rain away
(verse 1)
I'm tired of waiting for things to change
I've exhausted all the patience I have
So baby when you come home tonight
Let's pretend everything's all right
Baby come and take the rain away
Chorus
(verse 2)
Just for tonight let's leave our problems behind
Let's lose ourselves in passion for one night
So baby when you come home tonight
Let's pretend everything's all right
Baby come and take the rain away
Chorus
(bridge)
Kiss the rain drops on my face
Only you can take me from this place
On a cloud let's ride away
We can disagree another day
Chorus

Huddled like rabbits
By the hole by the fence
Frozen like statues
To the chair on the lake
Clouds of birds
Make shadows on the moss
Fields of kale
All patterned with ice
Oh-ohohhh ouuuuutside
Oh-ohohhh the swans rise
Like the neck of a swan
And the veil of the sky
All peppered with rain
A fields of crows
They cling to the bone
And the a love unchanged
By the chatter of time
Oh-ohohhh outside
Oh-ohohhh the swans rise

Oh bar
What is it?
Move it up
Drink it up
Roll it up
Shake it up
Move it up
Drink it up
Roll it up
Shake it up

Pick me up and hose me down
I'm sorry boys about the dirty night clowns
The Earth does bright, the things that we make
Like a model planes and gooey cakes
I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year
I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year
Let them be buried, buried alive
In their suits, in their ties
Trees to shade the moves that they made
In their suits, in their ties
Let them be buried, buried alive
In their suits, in their ties
You're safe here, now you're in the clear
Now we'll eat soup and apple pies
I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year
I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year
I will never be dirt-free
Hold me, hold me
Like a baby
(La da da da da da da dumb
Da da da da dum)
X2
I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year

This is a strange familiar place
Where I am living
The world that was and what's become
Are not the same
I see the evidence of grace
Without forgetting
How far I've had to come
To get me where I am today
If justice had the only say
Well I would not be here
Cause less than anything
Is more than I deserve
But I can put the past away
There's nothing left to judge
Forgiveness is the final word
CHORUS
Everywhere I turn
I see compassion but I'm learning
I'm just a fallen man
In the land of mercy
Love is free to grow
Where Heaven's healing waters flow
Though I may not understand
I'm living in the land of mercy
It seems I never have to ask
For what I'm given
I see the answer long before I see the need
No longer looking to the past
As just a prison
For what has been helps me remember
What I used to be
REPEAT CHORUS
BRIDGE
Though I may walk through the valley below
I will not fear because I know
who rules this world I'm walking through
REPEAT CHORUS (2X)
Love is free
I'm living in the land of mercy
Tell me what you see
I'm living in the land of mercy

You're amazing, so amazing
Have I told you enough?
You're my angel, my guardian angel
God knows I, I've been blessed
with love
But if I'll be gone tomorrow
Would you know how deep my love goes?
Have i ever told you, your the one?
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know, i hope it still shows
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know what my heart wants to stay
A love so tender, i surrender to this
feeling so true
My affirmation, my inspiration
Darling i, I've been blessed with you
But if I'll be gone tomorrow
Would you know how deep my love goes?
If i was gone forever would you know how much i care?
That you make me feel like flying, that I'm sailing over your ocean
That every time you look at me you see it in my eyes
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know, i hope it still shows
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know, i hope it still shows
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know what my heart wants to say
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know, i hope it still shows
If the words don't come my way
I hope you still know, i hope it still shows
I hope you still know what my heart wants to say

You know, we've been spending a lot of time together and um, I was wondering do you:
(Feel the same way I do)
I can tell you, I know you need me to show you, but, it's better if I hear it from you.
You know what, let me explain myself.
It's seven am you're still here with me, and last night I held you tightly so.
What does that mean, you see I know what it means to me.
It means that I, I, wouldn't let you go.
Tell me, is your heart still spinning from the night before?
(You are real good yeah).
And you really need to let me know are you here just for, (sexual dealings).
See if you are then, (I), I just can't live a, (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you.
But if you tell me, (I), am the one and this is, (right),
Then we can spend the night tonight like always.
But first you, gotta tell me
[Chorus]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Don't think you know, that I won't let you know unless you (Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you.
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, us can be a good thing.
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do) do.
So now it midnight, haven't heard a reply.
But I can see the truth lies in your eyes.
Could it be that you tried, but I didn't see the sunset pass me by, when you were making love to me.
Said it three times, (you said) you love me, (after) you held me.
But then you never even said goodnight.
(Anything I ask of you) you give it, (when you wanted me) I submitted, still no commitment, but if I don't get it then,
(I) I just can't live a (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you.
But if you tell me, (I), I am the one and this is, (right), you can spend the night tonight like always.
Long as you first tell me
[Chorus]
Ooh I see your eyes, and I hear you calling.
When you're speaking and I need to hear something.
First thing I wanna hear (I've been meaning to tell you something).
The second thing is (If I can't have you I don't want nothing).
Who that knockin' at my door this time of night?
Ooh oh, hey baby.
What you doing over here so late?
I wanted to tell you somethin'.
I just, I don't know how to tell you right.
Do you have anything you want to say?
Alright, you know what, I love you
[Chorus]
Feel the same way I do. [Repeat x3]

EMERALD CITY GREEN:
I want to be seen green
Wouldn't be caught dead, red
'Cause if you are seen green
It means you got mean bread
You've got to be seen green
To show that you're stuff's layed
If you're not seen green
You better be wearing jade
Oh, you've got to be seen green
Don't tell them your cupboard's bare
That you gave up one week's feed
To pay for your colored hair
Oh, oh, oh
AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE GREAT POWERFUL OZ:
I thought it over and green is dead
'Till I change my mind, the color is red
EMERALD CITY RED:
I wouldn't be seen green
Ooo! Oo! Oo! Ah! Ah!
I wouldn't be caught dead
And if I'm caught at all
Then catch me in dead, red
Ooo!
You've got to be dead red
You've got to be real hot
So throw away those green gems
And wear rubies on your yacht
You've got to be dead, red
You've got to have flash and flair
And if you're not seen red
Then you shouldn't be seen nowhere
Ah!
How quickly fashion goes down the drain.
Last week when you all was wearin' pink
Already for me red was old.
The ultimate brick is gold.
That's the new color, children
EMERALD CITY GOLD:
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
You got to be seen gold
Watch out for the new kind
You got to have old gold
Like some from a gold mine
You got to be wearin' gold
The twenty four carat kind
And once you've shined it up
It should ought to make you blind, ah!
You got to be seen in gold
To show that you're super slick
It helps to pay tips and tolls
It's the ultimate yellow brick
It's the ultimate
Gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Golden gold
Gold, gold, gold, gold
Gold!

I see she
Knowing what I came here for
Get a little of your womanifestation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it grow
We can draw the line on where we
Let the fingers go
Now I know me
Never wanna lose control
Making me the subject
Of your warm initiation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it show
You make me nervous but it's now or never
Oh Oh
You can be my message from above
And it's time to say you're sorry
We can sanctify our love
Oh no
And you and I we're written in the wind
You can't just go movin' out
You can't leave me when I'm movin' in
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
It's you or me
Gotta be a kill or cure
Maybe undergo a lover's operation
Nothing cuts like a knife can
You don't wanna hurt me more
Look at all that damage
We could do together
Oh no
You can wear me closer to the bone
It don't work to make me worry
But the demon seed is sown
Oh no
And you and I we're written in the sky
You can't make me hold on
Better you shoot my love between the eyes
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie
And what I see as fact is fiction
You won't let me die
And I'm bound to be abused
I won't let you cut me loose
This love is out to get you
When the blood begins to flow

Into their cheering hands
And the faces of his friends
No blood turned so bitter
And skulls stayed simple
Every body in its place
Strange you should want it the same
Breakers in my lungs
The graceless years are gone

She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
When she woke up late in the morning
Light and the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
O' what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching sun
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants - all that she wants
So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It's a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of that is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you
All that she wants

We were strangers starting out on a journey
Never dreaming what we'd have to go through
Now here we are and I'm suddenly standing
At the beginning with you
No one told me I was going to find you
Unexpected, what you did to my heart
When I lost hope, you were there to remind me
This is the start
And life is a road and I want to keep going
Love is a river, I want to keep flowing
Life is a road, now and forever
Wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm's through
At the end I want to be standing
At the beginning with you
We were strangers on a crazy adventure
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true
Now here we stand unafraid of the future
At the beginning with you
And life is a road, and I want to keep going
Love is a river, I want to keep flowing
Life is a road, now and forever
Wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm's through
At the end I want to be standing
At the beginning with you
Knew there was somebody somewhere
Help me, alone in the dark
Now I know my dream will live on
I've been waiting too long
Nothing's gonna tear us apart
And life is a road and I want to keep going
Love is a river, I want to keep flowing
Life is a road, now and forever
Wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm's through
In the end I want to be standing
At the beginning with you
And life is a road and I want to keep going
Love is a river, I want to keep going on
Starting out on a journey
Life is a road and I want to keep going
Love is a river I want to keep flowing
In the end I want to be standing
At the beginning with you

And it's too late for us to argue now And it's too late for you to cry And it's too late for you to ask me now Oh it's just too late tonight And the sweet rose has bloomed and died And it's too late for you to find me now And my feelings for you have changed now And I told you it would come to this And it's just too late tonight But when I talk to you, you always resist And you only see what you wanna see But you never listen to me And it's too late for questions now And so you sit and wonder why And you're searching for all the answers now But it's just too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight Oh yeah It's too late tonight Everything about me's changed It's too late tonight Now our lives are rearranged It's too late tonight It's too late tonight Everytime we try to talk It's too late tonight All you ever do is walk It's too late tonight It's too late tonight It's too late tonight

What you gonna do when you get back home?
Get a job?
Pull your weight now?
What you gonna do when she sees through your eyes?
And through your lies?
Can you tell me?
What you gonna do when she calls your name?
Oh, high priestess
Can you help me?
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
Oh, high priestess
Can you save me?
Listen to my prayer
What you gonna do when you get back home?
From the slow, long journey
Who's to set it up on a golden throne?
She says no
You better get what you came for
listen to yourself
Listen to your

Playing it safe so long
You lost your inspiration
Clingin' to things that turn out wrong
Won't help a situation
Makin' me pay for the unhappy times
(That's bummer)
Maybe the moon night make you change your mind
(*) So don't hold back
Contact
Give yourself a bit of some prime time love
Don't fight
What feels right
You're lookin' in the face of prime time love
I know she left you cold
That's why you need protection
Buyin' the lies that you were sold
Keeps you from true affection
Why waste your nights on tryin' to find
Someone better
Baby, my arms are gonna be so kind
Repeat (*)
Trust is the answer
That's how it starts
I'll take my chances
This one's from the heart

Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes, I thought this love would last
Who am I to question why?
Who an I?
Darling when I'm hurt
That's when I'm satisfied
Tell me what it's worth
To pursue the Holy life
I can see your face
Even when I close my eyes
I can give you love
Even when I've been denied
Who's loving who?
Who's fooling who?
Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes, I thought this love would last
Who am I to question why?
Who am I?
Darling what is love
If it never gets you high?
Should we sit and wait
While the wasted years roll by?
Is there time to say
If I lied, I apologize?
Never go away
Please stay here by my side
Who's fooling who?
Who's loving who?
Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes, I thought this love would last
Who am I to question why?
Who an I?
They try to break you
They try to steal your stars
If they ever take you
Just remember who you are
They try to hate you
Just like some love bizarre
It's a sign of weakness
To be afraid of what you are
Who's loving who?
Who's fooling who?
Even God can't change the past
No matter how many tears I've cried
Yes, I thought this love would last
Who am I to question why?

Come on and tell me baby
Do you believe in love
The way that I do
And when u find the one
Wherever u go will travel with u
What can I say
Where do I start
To pick up the pieces of your broken heart
Tell me one more time
Why your heart cannot be mine
Look into my eyes and say
That love has gone
And I'll be man enough to walk away
Tell me one more time
Why your dreams cannot be mine
'Cause I won't believe it's true
Until I hear it from u
Do you believe in love
There's no right no wrong, no, no,
Loves just an open road
With different ways of moving on
I dare you to stay
And watch me now
Leaving is taking the easy way out
Tell me one more time
Why your heart cannot be mine
Look into my eyes and say
That love has gone
And I'll be man enough to walk away
Tell me one more time
'Cause I won't believe it's true
Until I hear it from you
They can my life
I want you so bad
And losing you, means losing all that I had
And this is crazy
Girl why cant you see
Your the only one
That ever mattered to me
Oh baby!

Chubby little pun'kin sat in the patch
Waitin' breathlessly to see just who was gonna snatch him
He plucked himself up,
He kept himself clean 'cause it was just a few days 'til Halloween
A pretty little cutie in a lavender dress
Saw our boy and picked him up
Then she began to caress him
She hugged him and she squeezed till they were cheek to cheek
She almost dropped him on his bottom when he started to speak!
Could I make a small suggestion?
Like to ask you you just in case you would remember this request when you're designin' my face
He said:
Please, please, please, please gimme a smile!
I'm only gonna be here for the littlest while
Don't wanna be the jack-o-lantern scarin' away
Every candy-lovin' kid who's trick-or-treatin' today!
No one wants a friend who only can frown-
Turn up the ends of my mouth instead of turnin' 'em down!
Lookin' like a monster really isn't my style
So please, make me, pretty please!
Gimme a smile!
He was a little bit worries, a little perplexed
'Cause all his orange friends were actin' tougher than the next guy
One put on a grimace, one more a scowl
One even wore a sheet and then be-gan to howl!
He was oh so happy to be the little girl's choice
He giggled and he stammered in his shy little voice
Then he whispered to her sweetly,
In their cozy embrace
"I want a pretty smile, just like the one on your face!"
"I'm only makin' one appearance in this fleetin' pumpkin life!"
"Could you grant my one desire when you carve me with that knife?"
Please, please, please, please gimme a smile!
I'm only gonna be here for the littlest while...
Don't wanna be the jack-o-lantern scarin' away
Every candy lovin' kid who's trick-or-treatin' today!
I'd be ever so grateful
If you'd gimme a grin
Let all the happy little children see the brightness within!
Don't gimme no fangs like that mean crocodile!
Please, make me, pretty please,
Gimme a smile!
Please! Please! Gimme a smile?
I'm only gonna be here for the littlest while!
I don't wanna be the jack-o-lantern scarin' away
Every candy lovin' kid who's trick-or-treatin' today!
Give me a great big grin, I'll be the happiest guy!
The evenin' after Halloween I'll be the tastiest pie!
Well, if I gotta go, let me be goin' in style!
Oh please, please, pretty please!
Gimme a smile!
C'mon! Gimme a smile!

Hey boy
It's a matter of fact
I've got what you want
So don't hold back.
Hey boy
So come and get it
Let's have some fun
I want to show you you're the only one.
He said: you're too keen
I said: I know what you mean.
Deep down
Down inside
It's a matter af fact.
Baby
I'm waiting anticipating
Yes
It's more than physical.
I can't disguise it
I'm so excited
Hey boy.
Hey
Hey boy
I've been watching you
Come on and show me what you can do.
Hey
Hey boy
You've got what I want
Stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine.
Hey boy
You said: what you're doing to me?
I said: you wait and see.
Deep down
Down inside
It's a matter of fact.
Baby
I'm waiting anticipating
Yes
It's more than physical
Baby
I'm waiting anticipating
Yes
It's more than physical
Deep down
Deep down
Deep down
Deep down.
Deep down
Down inside
It's a matter of fact.
Baby
I'm waiting anticipating
Yes
It's more than physical
Baby
I'm waiting anticipating
Yes
It's more than physical
Baby
I'm waiting anticipating
Yes
It's more than physical

Say that you like me the way I am
Just take some time out to understand
It may not be much, but I do all I can
Say something nice
I'd never do it to one of you
I'd say something nice if it wasn't true
I'd make you feel better when you're feeling blue
I'd say something nice
Say something nice, only once or twice
Say something nice, only once or twice
Say something nice
I want to hear that I'm beautiful
But you wouldn't say it even if I were
Wearing my diamonds and a coat of fur
You wouldn't say nothin' nice
Tell me you think that my hair's real nice
Don't stand around and just criticize
Can't you understand that when a person tries
You say something nice
And it's oh so hard, oh so hard
To listen to the words that you say
Oh, say something nice, just once or twice
It wouldn't hurt, don't you see
I want to hear something nice, say something nice
Say something nice, just once or twice
It don't hurt you at all, say something nice
Say something nice baby, only once or twice
Say something nice
Say something nice baby, only once or twice
Say something nice
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me
Say something nice
Say something nice
And it's oh so hard, and it's oh so hard
And I'm dying to hear what I've never heard (fade out)

So many stories to be told across the ages young and old.
Could it be that we've become immune to all we hear on daytime news,
Where is the passion to unite?
Because divided we can't fight all the troubles in this life.
There's so many things that we are fighting, yeah.
There's so many people out there trying, yeah.
[Chorus]
And there's a little girl only six years old.
Her daddy does drugs.
Her mama's on the road.
She's a latchkey kid before she's even grown.
What we really need to do is give the girl a chance.
Put her on the road where there's no way back,
To a life that she's always known.
We gotta do something, yeah.
Can't do nothing, yeah.
A&E; is full of life.
Somebody's son got in a fight.
Doctors say it's touch and go,
So nobody's going home.
Friday night is where it starts.
Kids all high and having fun.
There will be a loss of life.
Trivial things that start a fight.
There's so many things we could be fighting. Yeah.
But do we give a damn and are we trying? Yeah.
[Chorus]
It's a crazy world we're living in. Yeah.
It's a crazy world we're living in. Yeah.
Across town in a club, a girl's on the floor.
She's lying in the dark.
She did it once before.
Her body's full of drugs.
She did it for a rush.
Don't it make you wonder just how many more?
We gotta do something; it's not right.
Can't keep saying our hands are tied.
Gotta do something but it's too late:
There'll be another mother digging a grave.
There's so many things that we are fighting. Yeah.
But do we give a damn and are we trying? Yeah.
[Chorus]
It's a crazy world we're living in. Yeah.
It's a crazy world we're living in. Yeah.
The world's gone crazy that we are living in.
The world's gone crazy that we are seeing in.
The world's gone crazy more than a little bit.
The world's gone crazy. Yeah.
The world's gone crazy that we are living in.
The world's gone crazy that we are seeing in.
The world's gone crazy more than a little bit.
The world's gone crazy.

It takes lots of time for a star to come crashing down
I caught you falling to my world just to love you, babe
You found me first, said the words
You admit that you want it, how bad do you need it?
I was meant for you, you were meant for me
No one else would do, it's plain to see
I knew this from the start, each and every day
That you could have my heart forever and always
I could be the one you love
Take you high, take you low
Don't make me wait too long
Don't make me wait too long
'Cause love has saved me
I've gotta let you know, let you know
My heartbeat's racing outta control, outta control
You affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my heart
I can't believe what I see, must be destiny
Two broken hearts that beat as one but this is heaven, babe
I need to get your angel kiss, almost didn't believe it
I thought I was dreaming
I was meant for you, you were meant for me
No one else would do, it's plain to see
I knew this from the start, each and every day
That you could have my heart forever and always
I could be the one you love
Take you high, take you low
Don't make me wait too long
Don't make me wait too long
'Cause love has saved me
I've gotta let you know, let you know
My heartbeat's racing outta control, outta control
You affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my
Some say love is self-sacrifice, but with you I don't have to try
When you find the one you'll just know, know
Don't get scared take a chance, don't let it slip through your hands
'Cause love will save you
'Cause love has saved me
I've gotta let you know, let you know
My heartbeat's racing outta control, outta control
You affect the rhythm of my heart
Love saved me
You affect the rhythm of my heart
I've gotta let you know
You affect the rhythm of my heart
Heart racing, you affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my heart
You affect the rhythm of my heart

Every day I sent another present
Just to let her know how very much I care
I wrote a little love note with each present
But it didn't seem to get me anywhere
My poor worried heart was almost certain
That this love affair would never be
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and
From that moment, she belonged to me
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the Spring
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her
Roses and roses and roses of love
Roses, roses, roses, I thank you for saying what I couldn't say
Oh, what a wonderful way to tell her I love you each day
With roses and roses and roses of love

(Nathan)
There is nothing glamorous in this simple town
But there's this special flower that can only bloom right here
And all the heavy burdens in our heart,
Get carried away
The wind can smooth the wrinkles of the past
Like a dazzling reflection in the sky
I hear the distant calling of the ancient ripples of the sea
And I realise that your laughter reminds me
Of the soothing sound of the gentle ocean
(Wanya)
And your heart can't cover up the look of loneliness
You don't have to reveal it to me
But anytime you need it
These faces so familiar in your heart
Wait for you to reach to their hands
I want to know if that place
That I've been once before
Hasn't ever changed
And remains the place that always will be there for me
Till the last goodbye ill cherish it
And I can't stop looking back to see
That you're smiling waving back at me
Gonna bite my lips not to cry
And I'm trying to fight this feeling
But the tears may get so hard to see
Ill be waiting for the day
We can reunite again
Where the flowers bloom
For Jus me and you
(Shawn)
There is something that the shadows can't explain
Something so simple and so obvious, that we forget
Behind the cloudy surface of it all, if we look up above
We'll see the sun shine illuminate everything we see
All the past and present faces here are all to stay
Each prayer wishes new memories
Im proud to have it all
These memories alive inside my heart
Blossoming vividly one by one
After the rain the roads are muddy and there's puddles everywhere
And we clearly see all the footsteps in this journey thru this life we lead
And I pray these tears can find a way and breathe life back into the day
When the weltered petals in my heart once again blossoming
And ill whisper to the ocean breeze and my wish will soar above the seas
And a rainbow in the sky will appear for you and i
Glistening in the sun, shine for everyone
(Wanya, Shawn)
Hey, the only place where the flowers bloom
The only place where this wind can blow
The only place you can hear this song
The only place you can see these sign
Hey, the only place where the flowers bloom
The only place where this wind can blow
(Shawn)
I want to know if that place
That I've been once before
Hasn't ever changed
And remains the place that always will be there for me
And ill try to fight this feeling
But the tears may get so hard to see
Ill be waiting for the day
We can reunite again
(Wanya)
After the rain the roads are muddy and there's puddles everywhere
And we clearly see the footsteps in this journey thru this life we lead
I try to fight this loneliness
But the tears may get so hard to see
Even thru the scars and memories
I won't forget you and me
So radiantly shining thru
The horizon as it rises high
And the wind carries it star beneath the memories
Ooh still im waiting for you

I can hear your soul crying
Listen to your spirit sighing
I can feel your desperation
Emotional deprivation
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your feelings show
Picking up the conversations
Deep in your imagination
Tune in to the lonely voices
Talking of their only choices
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your spirit grow
Step out of your cage and onto the stage
It's time to start playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state
I can taste the tears falling
The bitterness that's inside you calling
Yearning for a liberation
Emotional emancipation
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your senses overflow
Step out of your cage and onto the stage
It's time to start playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state

Saw some pictures in the paper
Of a girl I'd met the day before
I couldn't believe that hours later
I had reporters knocking at my door
But I used to dream about the
Life I'm living now and
I didn't think I'd miss those things from the past
And I'm not afraid of leaving or letting go of what I had 'cause
I realize that now there's no turning back
'cause I'm a young heart living in a world filled with love
So when teardrops fall from me like rain from above
I can brush my troubles away
know that deep down inside
I've got sunshine in my life
I used to think i could do better
My girlfriends always used to get me wrong
Sent distant messages, love letters
But those kind of feelings never lasted long
'cause now the only love I find's whithin a castle made of sand
And when the tide goes out it's swept away
Though I've got my peace of mind & time is firmly on my side
So through the bad times I can safely say..
[Chorus]
Ah... now that love's here to stay
I've found a better day to brush my troubles away
[Chorus (x2)]

You left me with a problem
Now I know what it's all about
You took my heart and split it up
Now you know what it's all about
How do you feel my love
Do you feel it as I walked away?
How do you feel my love
Do you feel it as I walked away?
Who knows what kind of pity for
Excuse you from yourself
To just be find the misery
That you put yourself within
How do you feel my love
Need to find myself
All that I've got left
Used up
Oh
I'm used up
Need to cry but still got to show my will
Been used too much
How do you feel my love
Need to find myself
All that I've got left
How do you feel my love

A room with a hundred men
The design of a perfect blend
Identical strains of code
Dressed up in the fashion mode
The air I breathe
The blood that moves
My heart to mend I cry
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The mind of a mannequin
The look of the perfect twin
This army of confidence
Is an army of no defense
The air I breathe
The blood that moves
My heart to mend I cry
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The air that I breathe
The blood that moves me
One broken heart mend
The self I defend
The air that I breathe
The blood that moves me
One broken heart mend
The self I defend
I walk through a no man's land
Come lend your creating hand
How I crave for identity
Come lend me your fantasy
The air I breathe
The blood that moves
My heart to mend I cry
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone
The tears of a clone

It was almost Christmas time
There I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
I'm really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing around like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say
"Sir, I wanna buy these shoes for my momma please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry sir? Daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes will make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if momma meets Jesus tonight"
They counted pennies for what seemed like years
And the cashier says, "Son, there's not enough here"
He searched his pockets franticly
Then he turned and he looked at me
And he said, "Momma made Christmas good at our house
Most years she just did without
Tell me sir, what am I gonna do
Somehow I gotta buy her these Christmas shoes"
So I laid the money down
I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face
When he said, "Momma's gonna look so great"
"Sir, I wanna buy these shoes for my momma please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry sir? Daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes will make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if momma meets Jesus tonight"
I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me what Christmas is all about
"Sir, I wanna buy these shoes for my momma please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry sir? Daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes will make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if momma meets Jesus tonight
I want her to look beautiful if momma meets Jesus tonight"

Baby you've been given feeling to me all night
And I can't leave unless you leaving with me tonight
Now it's not difficult to tell, oh baby you selecting
And I think you selecting me

Some people they search their whole lives
Lookin' for somebody who's just right
Sometimes they settle for less
Lose outta true happiness
Then they finally wake up one day
And realize there's nothing to say
It's hard to let go
Even when ya deep down both know
So they fight and fight and fight
And no more kissin' kissin' goodnight
But baby that can't happen to us

How it feels to be feelin' no doubt
You'll be right there when I fall
And I'll be promisin' you the world
No getting down on your knees
Trying to get what ya need
It's a good situation
Sorry for elaboratin'
But I want more and more and more
So just keep knockin' knockin' knockin' on my door
But baby you're a hard thing to find

Darling you were looking good
When you came to me
And asked for a dance
And I said "we can dance"
Felt like a queen
Swedish summer nights are hot
And the trees can talk
We lay on the grass
So easily, so blessed
Whispers in blindness
And I didn't hold you back
I'm talking about it babe
'Cause you've been teasing me
I'm talking about it
'Cause you are bad right through
Stay with me and I shall want
No other love
Stay with me another love another lie
Stay with me and I shall want
No other love
You were talking so sweet
But you were touching
And teasing
I can hear the soft bells ring
Through a thousand years
They call out to me
They say it's only once in a life we love
Now I've had the honor too
You were holding my hand
You were kissing my skin
Stay with me
Trees are whispering
Only once my dear

Some people suppress you
They partch you
And reap a disaster
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment
Shows the contempt
Between the world and their
Embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings
Realize the man who says anything
The great commandment
The needies believe you
They treat you
Like survivors of a disaster
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment

We are the leaders and nothing can beat us
It feels so good the angels can take you there
You better beware of devil may care
Tell me where you want to go

Heaven's above and hell's below
We are the leaders
Oh sing hallelujah sing hallelujah
Giving it to you

Heaven's above and hell's below
We are the leaders
Sing hallelujah sing hallelujah

It feels so good your mind can take you there
But why does it go your body and soul

It was your smile it was your style
That had me gone from the jump
It was your name it was your sign
That made want to run
Fly me to Vegas
Packing my bag
Don't know where it would take us
When I come back
Ill be with you
You'll be with me
And the rest is history
Welcome to Vegas
Love on the runway
Soon as we land in the airport hold my hand
Welcome to Vegas
Loui duffly bags we exit through out terminal

In real life I'm waking up alone
It's one more night you didn't make it home
And one more time you won't pick up the phone
In real life you never bring me flowers
When you're here it's only for an hour
I'm getting used to being on my own
Because in real life you're not what I thought
Real life, this isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem
But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
Then I wake up and realize, realize this is real life
Real life, this is real life, real life, real life
Real life, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, real life
In real life it doesn't always work out
People fall in love and then they fall out
Hearts can break and never make a sound
Because in real life you're not what I thought
Real life, this isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem
But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
Then I wake up and realize, realize this is real life
Just when I thought this was all real life could be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody came along and made my dream reality
And now in real life, waking up to roses
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always
Gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, he's standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
When I wake up, I realize, realize this is real life

Reality reality reality is always
You tattooed yourself what a piece of art
You've already broken your mother's heart
When I was your age working my ass off
Your generation's soft
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's keeping her from searching
You cannot pierce that and
You're dressed too tight
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right
So dye you hair, dad's gonna wash it out
Come on wash out your mouth
Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's hiding in the shadow
Reality reality reality is always
Reality is always

Yo a yo I was on the plane with the wayne.
You can call me whitley I go to hill mane.
Listen, I'm the baddest in the school, the baddest in the game.
Excuse me honey but nobody's in my lane.
When you was in new york, you was fuckin' the yankee.
I was fuckin' with base I was pitchin' to franky.
These bitches so cranky, give them a hanky.
My mommy I'm cold gimme my blanky
Flyer then a kite I get higher then rapunzel.
Keep the snow white I could buy it buy the bundle.
Step your cookies up for they crumble.
Don't be actin' like the cardinals and gone fumble (fumble)
'Cause I'm a steeler fresh up out the dealer.
All the dope boys gone steal her. Flow so sick I need a healer.
Fuck, is my mac concealer.
I be out in queens on the back of fort weep
Weep da weep da wheelers I'm a big bill.
That's why I get more head than a pig tale.
Puts some mansh I'm gettin' the munchies.
I think I have a wrap bitch from a entree'

Late last night the midnight movie
Went out in a blaze of clichs
A cultured voice whispered goodnight
And suggested I switch off the set
Well my eyes felt so heavy, the sofa so warm
That I slept till the static awoke me
And there on the screen, such as I've never seen
Was a girl strange and beautiful, smiling.
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Well I looked in amazement, she gazed at me, so intent
Was her expression and then
She spoke oh so frail in technical detail
Of her world so that someone might hear
Well science is inexcusably intricate
Love is rewardingly simple
She smiled tenderly, looking so heavenly
That I longed to be way out in space with . .
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Then she said 'goodbye' and though vainly I tried
To say 'stay', the picture broke up
I'm a little too late to communicate
For the distance is too great between us
It's all of two million light years . . .
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral
Jayne from Andromeda Spiral

In my leisure suite
Quit talking
Just talking
Please
In my leisure suite
Sometimes
I feel the room surround me
With possibility
Build fires to stoke them
Let's fix what's been broken
Words have been stolen
But silence is golden
In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there
Don't come knocking
This doors for locking
Have you got the key
In my leisure suite
Hang up your jacket
Undo my back zip
Please
Moonlight on blanket
It's great when your backlit
Features in close-up
The moment we woke up
In my leisure suite
Just a place to meet
We can press repeat
And do what we do when we're there
In our leisure suite
Come lie next to me
We can be complete
And do what we do when we're there
In my leisure suite
In my leisure suite

[ Verse 1 ]
It started off grand, and ended in ruins,
Thought you were the one, never knew what we were doing, no
You didn't know when, to stop all of your games,
And you left me here, left me without any shame,
And so the truth came out,
You couldn't promise me the love that I was,
Pouring out for you,
And when you went away,
I couldn't get you out of my mind oh I was,
broken down for you,
[ Chorus ]
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,
Ooh
[ Verse 2 ]
I gotta be frank; I can't imagine me with anyone other than you,
You had me feeling like my dreams came true,
You made me feel good, like no one else existed,
Like summer was here everyday of the year,
Now it's just my wishful thinking,
And so the truth came out,
Your promised someone else the love that I was,
Pouring out for you,
And when you went away,
I couldn't get you out of my mind,
Oh I was broken down for you,
[ Chorus ]
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget, no I won't ever forget you,
Mmmm,
And there is a light, and it never goes out,
And there is a promise, and I don't mean to scream and shout,
But there is a fog, and it's blocking that light,
Gotta let you go, no use in fighting this fight,
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget,
No I won't ever forget you..
500 days, I know it wasn't the best,
But I won't ever forget,
No I won't ever forget you..

I went sifting through old letters just to find your number written on a page.
sometimes I remember secrets that you said in places nobody could trace.
ohh you creep around my head, with all the things you said
and boxes that you kept labled light with my name.
In case I didnt stay.
Of course Id never stay for promises you breaaaaake.
I'll go running
I'll be where you are
I'll go running
I'll see
you'll find out
Watch me reinvent the weather
maddness in my head will turn a darker red
just as you had predicted my blood has turned quite thick
the sight of me will surely sicken you to death
all the people that you said
had been interrested in listening all disappeared
how convinent this was I placed all of my trust in someone I thought worthy of so very much
ohh you creep up on me kinda like a nightmare in my sleep
ohh you creep up on me kinda like a nightmare in my sleep

Show me love, better love)
Show me love, better love)
I cried myself to sleep again
You lie right there, but I've learned nothing
I do my best to ease your pain
And here we are, but we've learned nothing
And it's killing me
When I'm in your arms
I forget the darker days
And it's haunting me
These feet of mine
Won't let me march away
Don't ask me how
But I always thought that we could have a better love
When you lay me down
I forget that all I want is a better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
I hurt myself again today
You lie right there and you say nothing
I do my best to leave this pain
But here we are and we've learned nothing
And it's killing me
When I'm in your arms
I forget the darker days
And it's haunting me
These feet of mine
Won't let me march away
Don't ask me how
But I always thought that we could have a better love
When you lay me down
I forget that all I want is a better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me love, better love
Show me love, better love
And it's killing me
When I'm in your arms
I forget the darker days
And it's haunting me
These feet of mine
Won't let me march away
Show me a better, a better love (show me a better love)
A better love (show me a better love)
Show me a better love, a better love, better love (show me a better love)
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me love, better love

My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
Where their parents live
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel
I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
No I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
It's been two long years now
Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting' it back on the road now
But I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Oh I just take my time, I won't lie down
And take the long way around
Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could have made it easier on myself
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
If you ever want to find me I can still be found
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around

I've seen you fall with stupid pride,
The vunerability you try to hide,
Forget the past, and look at me now,
(And look at me now)
(And look at me now)
A cold expression on your face,
From your contempts I feel disgraced,
Forget it all, and look at me now,
(And look at me now)
(And look at me now)
You wanted the mystery,
You asked for, the real me,
My mask is beginning to slide,
So where we gonna go from here, my love?
What am I gonna say when you won't hear me?
You should know I'm there, by your side,
If you need me,
Will you take my love?
If I show you how?
See I could never be,
What you want from me,
Still I'd give you everything,
If you, if you take my life,
If you take my love,
How many times have I tried,
To tell you, I apologize?
Forget my words, and look at me now,
(And look at me now)
(And look at me now)
Three names cut deep inside your heart,
And one of them which is scarred,
Forget the pain, and look at me now,
(And look at me now)
(And look at me now)
See you never knew me,
But still you got to me,
I can't seem to leave you behind,
So where we gonna go from here my love?
What am I gonna do now you won't hear me?
You should know I'm always by your side,
If you need me,
Will you take my love?
If I show you how?
Oh I could never be,
What you want from me,
Still I'd give you everything,
If you, if you take my life,
If you take my love,
Will you take my love?
If I show you how?
Oh I could never be,
What you want from me,
Still I'd give you everything,
If you, if you take my life,
If you take my love,
Would you take my love?
Take a look at me now

We ride the tides
The waters wide
(So wild)
Calm the troubled water!
Hear the angels singin' all night
and all day
You hear them say
Glory hallelujah!
Lay your burden down
Your time is now
Turn around
Praise to love
Praise to god
We belong to the water
We belong to the air
We belong where there is love
Just remember this
You don't walk alone
As the storm it rages
Be not afraid
Let it pass away
Hear the angels singin'
Remember to remember! (turn around)
Praise to love
Praise to god
Call to god
For love
We belong to the fire
We belong to the air
We belong where there is love
We'll ride the tides
The waters wide (so wild)
Calm the troubled water

It thinks it's right when it knows it's wrong
It's been like this right from day one
It don't need anyone to be its guide
But it needs someone on its side
And I know that I can't make up my mind
I can feel it there's two of me inside, twinside
Make way for the end of frustration
Make may for the united front
One thought for a new situation
When it gets so it cannot walk
Can't stand up or even talk
Like a secret you cannot hide
It feels it kicking deep inside
And I know that I can't make up my mind
I can feel it there's two of me inside, twinside
Make way for the end of frustration
Make may for the united front
One thought for a new situation
When it feels ready to explode
It just sits quiet without a word
When the right thinks it knows best
The left will go for something else

It's getting cold, baby
I want your hot hands on me
It's getting cold, baby
I want your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
Our love is sweet, it might be pure
But there are some days I can't endure
Too lonely, cold, honestly
Give me those hot hands that I crave
Our love is sweet, it might be pure
But there are some days I can't endure
Too lonely, cold, honestly
Give me those hot hands that I crave
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands on me
I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands on me
Hot hands on me
Hot hands on me
I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
I want your hot hands on me
Hot hands on me
I want your hot hands on me

It must be you
Makin' me feel things I can't explain
For some reason I'm just laughin' at the rain
I can't believe
Who I am has changed so suddenly
I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do
This is not like me
It must be you
It must be love
Nothin' else could turn me upside down
Or plant my feet so firmly on the ground
What's happening
Everything I say I want to sing
Everything I've dreamed is coming true
What's this feeling in my heart
It must be you
Hold me now like this forever
And let this moment go on endlessly
?Cause I'm alive when you're beside me
That's how I know we're how it's supposed to be

She's a bad girl
Met her in a mad world
Says she wants to slow down
But this is what I told her, now
Hello miss you fucked me over, got me looking over my shoulder
Telling me lies like I don't know the difference
It's no secret where you been
You ain't discrete when walking with him
Up in your skin, yeah I can see the fingerprints
So I went looking for my own something on the side
I've been living my life
I've been living my life, yeah
Yeah, you think nobody knows
His cologne on your clothes
Everything is alright
Everything is alright, good
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
'Cause I been doing my shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I can't hate on anything you do
How could I ever be mad at you?
'Cause I been doing my shit too
I got OCD when it comes to that pussy
Says she don't wanna push me, yeah
But this the way she took me
From a dream into a nightmare
I could see the devil, he's right there
Stumbled upon a pack of someone's cigarettes
In the backseat of your Honda
You could say whatever you wanna
That doesn't mean that I will think you're innocent
I'm all in it, I'm past the limit
Knocking on the gates of heaven
Can I kick it?
I gotta find a piece of mind right now
'Cause I'm losing my mind right now
So I went looking for my own something on the side
I've been living my life
I've been living my life, yeah
Yeah, you think nobody knows
His cologne on your clothes
Everything is alright
Everything is alright, good
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
'Cause I been doing my shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I can't hate on anything you do
How could I ever be mad at you?
'Cause I been doing my shit too
She makes herself disappear like she's a magician
She's on her knees over there, but it ain't a religion
I know what you doin' doin' doin'
And who you doin' doin' doin' it to
Put her money on a horse and I bet it was Trojan
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
'Cause I been doing my shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I can't hate on anything you do
How could I ever be mad at you?
'Cause I been doing my shit too

You shake, I sweat, it stings
I ache, you're wet, I cling
Your thighs, your breasts, my cheek
Your eyes, undress, don't speak
Since when, on time, you smiled
Since then, oh i'm, beguiled
So pure, your skin, tiptoe
I'm sure, you win, don't go
Like gina lollobrigida in "belles de nuit"
Like gina lollobrigida in "belles de nuit"
I stare, for too long, and you woke
Your hair, a song, I stroke
I'm glad, this breeze, so still
You're sad, but please, I will
Like gina lollobrigida in "belles de nuit"
Like gina lollobrigida in "belles de nuit"

Sitting forever, looking at heaven
Wanting it so much
A born worrier, you better wake up to your heart
Or you'll break it, forsake it
I can't stand by and let you ruin it
We've come so far to be turned down now
I'm on your side, I'm a friend
To be certain isn't easy anyway
Come to heaven
I'm waiting, but tomorrow never comes
Come to heaven
Now or never, just take it
Oh baby, you only have to try it once
Wanting a miracle, getting too cynical
Taking it too far
I won't carry you
You've got to find out for yourself
Like I did, be decided
I can't stand by and let you ruin it
We've come so far to be turned down now
I'm on your side, I'm your friend
To be certain isn't easy anyway
Come to heaven
I'm waiting, but tomorrow never comes
Come to heaven
Now or never, just take it
Oh baby you only have to try it once
Now or never may be forever
Only now we could be together
No time for being clever
Gonna stay with you whatever
Let's embark on this endeavour
Baby it's now or never
Come to heaven
Oh baby you only have to try it once

When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius
Aquarius!

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation
Aquarius!

And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

[instrumental and tempo shift]
Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in
Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in
Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in, the sunshine in
[continue to end with concurrent scat]
Oh, let it shine, c'mon
Now everybody just sing along
Let the sun shine in
Open up your heart and let it shine on in
When you are lonely, let it shine on
Got to open up your heart and let it shine on in
And when you feel like you've been mistreated
And your friends turn away
Just open your heart, and shine it on in

West end girls
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand
It's pointing at your head
You think you're mad too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West end town
Call the police there's a mad man around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West end town
In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls
Too many shadows whispering voices
Faces on posters too many choices
If when why what how much have you got
Have you got it do you get it
If so how often
Which do you choose
A hard or soft option
In a West end town a dead end world
Meet East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls
In a West end town a dead end world
Meet East end boys and West end girls
Ooh a West end town in a dead end world
East end boys and West end girls
West end girls
I've said it all before, I'll say it all again
We're all modern men
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
And a West end town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End Girls
West End girls
You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
All your stopping, stalling and starning
Who do you think you are, Joe Stalin
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand
And it's pointing at your head
In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
East end boys and West end girls
West end girls
West end girls

Book Of Love
Book Of Love
Boy
I want to be where the boys are
but I'm not allowed
I wait outside of the boy's bar
I wait for them to all come out
I'm not a
boy
It's not my fault
that I'm not a boy
it's not my fault
I'm not a
boy
And now it's alright
without those boys
I stay at home at night
and I play with my toys
I'm not a
boy

NOTE: There are no lyrics for this track, BUT there is a voice saying the following
It is an age of fear and loathing
Forces of evil sweeped the land
But one venturous man refuses to participate in this new destructive way of life
He leaves in a quest for higher ground for those, who have suffered enough
The people call him: "The Explorer"
Choir:
Exploratori credimus, exploratorem sequimur
Exploratori credimus, exploratorem salutamus

Why am I chained to a memory?
Why does the thought of you still torture me?
When will I find someone to set me free?
So I won't be chained to a memory, mmm
Why am I chained to the hurt I knew?
Each day the thought of something so cruel to do
Where in this world will I escape from you?
So I won't be chained to a memory
Your letters threw them on the fire
Your pictures out the window
All that I could find that reminded me of you
I threw them all away
I get up in the morning
I'm pacing the floor
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory

I wake up I'm all alone
In my room
Glad you're gone
Alone is just the way I wanna be
Someone's waking up with you
Someone pretty, someone who you'll do that thing to
That you did to me
It's the only thing that I want lately
I don't miss your company
I just want those hands on me
To touch the places underneath
You can keep me out of your sight, that's alright
You can keep me out of your mind, even though
I know we're done you keep on turning me on
At night time when it's dark outside
I go to where I know you're hiding
Look up at your window from the street
You're up there, with somebody
Finally getting over me
You got something up there that I need
It's the only thing that I've been missing
I don't want your conversation
Come outside here for a second
Pay me some of your attention
You can keep me out of your sight, that's alright
You can keep me out of your mind, even though
I know we're done you keep on turning me on
You can keep me out of your sight, that's alright
You can keep me out of your mind, even though
I know we're done you keep on turning me on
Maybe I want one more kiss
Shouldn't I get one more wish?
Couldn't I just have you back for one more go around
The track?
It's easy, believe me
It's easy, you please me
It's easy
(You keep on turning me on)
You please me
(You keep on turning me on)
It's easy
(You keep on turning me on)
You please me
(You keep on turning me on)
You can keep me out of your sight that's alright
(You keep on turning me on)
You can keep me out of your mind that's alright
(You keep on turning me on)
You can keep me out of your sight that's alright
(You keep on turning me on)
You can keep me out of your mind that's alright
(You keep on turning me on)
(etc)

I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach
I watch the sun go down
From nine to five I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring - I'm an office clerk
The only think that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing that I'll be back at Echo Beach some day
On some enchanted evening
The sky's alive with lights
Our building in the distance is a surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach there's not a soul around
From nine to five I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring - I'm an office clerk
The only think that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing that I'll be back at Echo Beach some day

I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough

Tin boats and wooden huts
Or be a truck
Where women rule
You never see it
A nation screams
There's dust in the air
Their tears flow like rivers
You never see it
Dry air on cataloged shelves
You may decay
You may fade away
You never see it

You got me pullin' my hair
>From all your fussin' & fightin'
& you came into my heart
& you was not invited (ooohhh oh)
Boy who you think you are
With no invitation
I heard about boys like you
I just didn't know what I was facin'
What's your occupation
Why you ruinin' me
Why you do, why you do
These things to me
Who are you, who are you
You're bein' mean to me
I gotta go
Gotta leave
Why you do it to me
(Why, why, why you do it to me)
Now I'm too young to be stressed out (stressed out, stressed out)
But you don't know what I'm feelin'
Boy I done had it with you (you, you)
I had it up to the ceilin' (ceilin')
Had it up, had it up, had it up
I tried to work it out (out)
But I can't deal with a heartache
I know 'bout boys like you
& you learn from your mistake
& you was a mistake
Why you ruinin' me
Why you do, why you do
These things to me
Who are you, who are you
You're bein' mean to me
I gotta go
Gotta leave
Why you do it to me
(Why, why, why you do it to me)
You must get out
Hold up
Wait a minute
You could prevent it
I know what you are all about
I knew from the beginnin'
So I guess now you're finished
You must get out
Hold up
Wait a minute
You could prevent it
I know what you are all about
I knew from the beginnin'
So I guess now you're finished
Why you ruinin' me
Why you do, why you do
These things to me
Who are you, who are you
You're bein' mean to me
I gotta go
Gotta leave
Why you do it to me
(Why, why, why you do it to me)
(Repeat till end)

I feel exactly like a matchstick in relation to you
Thin and broken.
And nothing I can seem
There's Nothing I can seem to do
Make you switch the TV off
To Make you switch the TV off
And look up
Oh look up
Look up
Sail away
Sailing away from me also
I count your sticks and all your toys
You're laughing in the background noise
We won't give up
I'm going to give you something else
That's some kind of broken words
Children swing, to and fro
Do you ever wonder, where did the summer go?
Counting The TV's and counting the stars
It's so unfunny I don't know where you are any more
I don't know where you are any more
Sail away
Sail on back to me envy
I count your sticks and all your toys
Your laughter in the background noise
Please don't give up
I am gonna promise you something else
Some kind of broken loves
Yeah Yeah
Broken loves
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah etc
Sail away
Sail on back to me and then (yeah yeah)
I'll keep your sticks and all your toys
I'll keep you in the background noise
Yeah we don't give up
And I am gonna find you something else
Like some kind of broken loves

All I want for Christmas is you
Your the gift that's made my dreams all come true
All I need for Christmas is here
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes
Waiting there for me underneath the tree
We'll the spend the day exchanging kisses
Smile and say What a Christmas this is
Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells or mistletoe or the tinsel silver glow
You just look at me and Oh!
Christmas is here!
We will smile and say What a Christmas
This is
Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells or mistletoe
Or the tinsel silver glow
You just have to look at me and Oh!
Christmas is here

And yo ex boyfriend is an asshole
Let's make a movie or a video
Show that fool what he just don't know
Let's make a movie or a video
Girl lemme see that thng, just go loco

The Christmas tree is decorated, all the shopping's done
Stockings line the fireplace one by one
All the presents look so pretty, tied with brightly colored bows
All these things help make this season still everybody knows
Christmas needs love to be Christmas
Christmas needs hearts for a joy
Carolers singing, silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy
Christmas needs love to be Christmas
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt
The greatest of all gifts is love
Christmas needs love to be Christmas
Christmas needs hearts for a joy
Carolers singing, silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy
Christmas needs love to be Christmas
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt
The greatest of all gifts is love

I'm going down
Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I hear the sound of the memory
Maybe time will tell
Suddenly my life is like a river
Taking me places I don't want to go
But like all good men who swim too well
It takes all that I have just to cry for help
Then that voice in my head tells me no
I'm going down
Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I hear the sound of the memory
Maybe, who can tell ?
Let me live my life beside the river
Take me to places where a child can grow
And then maybe the boy inside will forsake me
Maybe the child in me will just let me go
I'm going down
The cold, cold water is rushing in
I'm going down
And I would beg to be forgiven
If I knew my sin

I had a dream on a back lot
I saw my life like a long shot
I smile at faces in a picture parade
Of all the stills from the films that you've made
We would see in the Essoldo
Up there drinking coffee on the Giocondo
Elstree, remember me
I had a part in a B movie
I played a man from History
Elstree, look at me
Now I work for the BBC
Life is not what it used to be
I took no dives in the fight scene
I had a stuntman keep my suit clean
There's no technology to fake up a song
They stop the orchestra if you get it wrong
Elstree, remember me,
I had a part in a B movie
I played a man from history
Elstree, look at me,
Now I work for the BBC,
Life is not what it used to be,
Elstree
They made a field into a war zone
I beat the enemy on my own
All the bullets just went over my head
There's no reality and no one dead, in
Elstree, remember me,
I had a part in a B movie
I played a man from history
Elstree, look at me
now I work for the BBC
Life is not what it used to be
Elstree
Elstree
Elstree
Elstree

Something quite unique

I would give the world to you
Or anything you need
Oh God thank you woman
Thank you thank you
For the joy that you give to me

I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you
I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should
Make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel
Like something could be going on
The more I see you
The more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you
I want to be down
With what you're going through
I want to be down down
I want to be down with you down with you
No matter the time of day or night
It's true I want to be down
I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone
To care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact then I'll be more
Than you ever could dream of
If all you need is my time
That I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my loving to you only, baby
I want to stay by your side
Be there to cool you out
And let you know everything will be alright

Ego don't ever get you anywhere
But now I know to speak up
Let my voice be known
I won't sit back pretend
My name hasn't been called
As if I'm running from my goal
I'll face the music with my soul
Don't talk to me like I am just a child
I've sold more stories than you've ever told
Don't be fooled
Softest touch but selfish growth
This driving force won't let me go
If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be
Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably
And scientifically
It's on the money
Advice is something we can choose to take
I've learned from teachers
That could orchestrate this whole wide world
You've got to think between the lines
And on your feet
Step up to the grade with no defeat
Appearances are deceptive, look at me
If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be
Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably
And scientifically
It's on the money
You'll say what you can
To try and break my stand
You just try your best
But I'll keep on bouncing back
It's all in your head
Go deal with that instead
On the money
On the money
On the money
If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be
Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably
And scientifically
It's on the money
If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be
Listen to what I say

Shattered glass, shooting stars, silver sparks
Come and shine on me
Take your time, don't hurry baby
Break a smile, when you come to me
I'm up on a high
Catch me if you fall
Up on a high
Your love fills me like a waterfall
Iris art, skin on skin, let me in
Take a ride with me
Take a trip, don't worry baby
Love the way we satisfy a need
I'm up on a high
Catch me if you fall
Up on a high
Catch me if you fall
You love fills me like a waterfall
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.

I took a walk through the fields on a sunny day
And saw a reflection of a face
Didn't notice the girl that looked at me
She was beautiful like an angel
She told me I shouldn't look so sad
He's the best friend I could ever have
There I go imaginaing things my minds running far away from me
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again
I met a man the other day said I remind him of his daughter
He just staired into my face and could I trade him in for water
He's thristy got a hundred miles to go there I go
Pretending to be somewhere that I've never been before
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again
I see the place that I've been lookin for
There's no invision no winning sometimes
Like a fairytale where I control all the lines
All that matters is me and I'm completely free
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again

Strophe 1
Never tear it apart
our love will lastI always stay with you
without you I am lost
kiss my lips and hold me tight
it never has to end
how many more of these lieswere you able to spend ?
Strophe 2
This is for ever
and for eternity
I remember these words
because once you told them to me
Bridge
I learned my lection from your attractio
I keep my heart from tearing it apart
I hide mmy feelings deep deep inside
so you can never hurt me with your lies
Ref.:
Hey, hey, hey
you are way of line
for the touch of your handsand the words that you spend
you're telling only lies

The past becomes the future days
I feel an affinity with you
The future comes where the past decays
I feel an eternity with you
I don't know where I'm coming from
And I don't care if I never ever return
And I don't know where I'm going to
And I don't care if I never ever get there
I feel an affinity with you
I feel an eternity with you
Your past becomes
The future days
The future comes
Where the past decays
I don't know where I'm coming from
And I don't care if I never ever return
I don't know where I'm going to
And I don't care if I never ever get there
The past becomes the future days
I feel an infinity with you
The future comes when the past decays
I feel an eternity with you
I don't know where I'm coming from
And I don't care if I never ever return
I don't know where I'm going to
And I don't care if I never ever get there
If I never ever get there, if I never ever get there

Every night
I gave myself three wishes
'cos I believed
I had a secret god
We made a deal
That you would stay together
But he let me down
You told me things
Beyond my understanding
The pain of love
I didn't wanna feel
But through the walls
I could hear you crying
And I can't sleep
And now, he holds me in his arms
And says our love will last
Forever, I'll never be alone
But still the little girl inside
Is here within my life
And I'm afraid of letting go
Nursery rhymes
Sung to me a bathtime
Will always be
A favourite memory
Of long ago
Before the dream was over
And the love had gone
Finally, relieved that it was ending
I told myself
I didn't really care
I made a god
For something to believe in
But no one's there
And now, he holds me in his arms
And says our love will last
Forever, I'll never be alone
But still the little girl inside
Is here within my life
And I'm afraid of letting go
But still the little girl inside
Is here within my life
And I'm afraid of letting go

Another day, another day
I decide to waste way
And contemplate how everything
Has changed
And though we tried
Not to compromise what burns inside
Your complex mind
That changes everyday
These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
And I don't know why
These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
The sun has yet to set
And you've already said goodnight
Emily, please, theres nothing wrong with
The way I light up
When you're around
Do anything you want but don't leave me out
Emily please, just get closer to me
A month went by, a month that I
Cant describe, a month I've been trying to push aside
And forget in time
And now we're inches away but
We're miles apart, so I'll dream of the day
And how we felt from the start
But dreams don't come easy these days
And the colors, they fade into gray
These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
Shes so determined to start a fight
These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
The sun has yet to set
And you're not here to say goodnight
Emily, please, theres nothing wrong with
The way I light up
When you're around
Do anything you want but don't leave me out
Emily come on, this was going somewhere
I wont let go of what we had
'Cause I'm the broken record that keeps on skipping back
And I still miss her
And I never thought that you'd leave me here all on my own
And I never thought that you'd be willing to take away my home
'Cause theres no one to call and
I'm so sick of being all alone
Miserably loving you
Emily, please, theres nothing wrong with
The way I light up
When you're around
Do anything you want but don't leave me out
Emily, please, theres nothing wrong with
The way I light up
When you're around
Do anything you want but don't leave me out
Emily come on, this was going somewhere
I wont let go of what we had
'Cause I'm the broken record that keeps on skipping back
Emily please, just get closer to me.

Into my car
Comes a light of a song
That lonely star
And the sound of the traffic home
How often am I here
Where I just disappear
Maybe I wash away
Am I awake or am I asleep
Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating somewhere in between
Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
She melts alone
To some stupid home drum song
And it feels so good
How do things go wrong guns
Pointing at your sons
All you do is talk away
Am I awake or am I asleep
Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating somewhere in between
Life is life Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Cafe station All talking
I guess I have no choice I need to find your voice
Or I'll just dissolve
Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating somewhere in between
Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Oh

When I wake up
I need ya out of my face
When I'm with her
She takes me out of my space
I wanna run, run, run, run
Run, run, run it again
I gotta run, run, run, run
Run, run, run it again, again
'Cause when I kiss her
I'm out of my mind
When I miss her
I lose track of time
I wanna run, run, run, run
Run, run, run it again
I gotta run, run, run, run
Run, run, run it again, again
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
When I love her
It feels so out of this world
When I touch her
I wish that she was my girl
I wanna run, wanna run, wanna run
Run, run it again
I gotta run, run, run, run
Run, run, run it again, again
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
Left her for you
I left my baby for you, for you
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
And I know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
Know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
So I whisper sweet nothings to you
Baby, please forgive me not
Heart shut, closed up
Closet door, it's openin'
Whisper sweet nothings to you
Baby, please forgive me not
Heart shut, closed up
Closet door, it's openin'
Whisper sweet nothings to you
Baby, please forgive me not
Heart shut, closed up
Closet door, it's openin'
Whisper sweet nothings to you
Baby, please forgive me not
Forgive me not, forgive me not
And I will start fallin'
'Cause you don't love me like she did
And I was all broken down
'Cause you don't love me like she did
Like she did, like she did
Like she did, like she did
Like she did, like she did
You don't love me like she did
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
Left her for you
I left my baby for you, for you
I left my baby for you
I left my baby for you, for you
Now it's over, it's over
It's over 'cause I'm lonely
Yeah, it's over, it's over
It's over, she don't want me
Yeah, it's over, it's over
It's over 'cause I'm lonely
Yeah, it's over, it's over
It's over, you don't want me anymore
It's over, you don't want me anymore
It's my fault, she don't want me anymore
She don't want me anymore
It's my fault, it's my fault

Uh uh, yeahhh [x4]
[Verse 1:]
Boy you know I'm loving what you do-oo-oo
Put your lovin in my gun I wanna sho-oo-ot
You're not the kinda guy (that I wanna) Loo-oo-se
The way you stroke that-got me all up under you
Watch you go (giddy up, giddy up now)
First, you grind it slow (get it, got it)
Hit it like a pro (oo-oo)
Make my body explode
[Chorus:]
Go Shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Go Shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Tick. Boom. Explode
(I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm, I'm...) [x3]
[Verse 2:]

But yo-oo-ou, got me like, "oo-oo"
So here's a toast (put it up, put it up now)

I pretend I'm mellow
So you don't think I'm hurt
I'm just a real sad fellow
Pretends he's so down to earth
And I might get a kiss
If I play my cards right
Don't care if I've missed
The whole goddamn point
Just pull myself together in the way
That you'd want me to
You're so mellow
You can't see I'm in pain
My knees turn to jello
And my eyes start to rain
And I might not get dissed
If I play my cards right
Don't care if I've missed
The whole goddamn point
Try to be nice in the way
That you'd want me to

The paths have been crossed
The crumbs are gone and the way, and the way is lost
Melancholy phantoms eye our skins
Poison apples falling with the wind
Hear the sigh of the trees
Those who enter here never leave
And the rangers stream out of their cabins
They are the hunters
We are the rabbits
Maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found
Further in and on we go
Sightless creatures tugging at our clothes
Cutting through the twilight, sword in hand
Strangers once united against the land
At the sound of the bells
They're pulling paper lanterns from their shelves
The rangers stream out of their cabins
They are the hunters and we are the rabbits
Maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want you tracking us down
The rangers stream out of their cabins
Raising their muskets
Flashing their badges
Maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found
They keep hiding a quiet like
They'll keep sneaking
But they won't find us
They'll keep living a quiet life
You and I
You and I
The ranger scream out of their cabins
They are the hunters,
We are the rabbits
Maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want you tracking us down
The rangers stream out of their cabins
Raising their muskets,
Flashing their badges
Maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found

Hold it (hold it X5)
She poses like it's for posters
And I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you are for me
She said don't you ever show this
I'm to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced it
She said your words give me open
So I closed it
When it closes
I'm only lovin for the moment
(Jae Millz)
She aint gotta man
But she's not alone
Miss. Independent
Here she got her own
Hey gorgeous
Um, I mean flawless
Well, that's what your are
How I see it is how I call it
Yeah
Look it how she walk
Mhmm she know she bad
Do (do) your thing baby
I aint even mad
And I aint even fast
I'm gonna stay a while
Hole your hair crisp
I'm gonna take a gander
(Young Lloyd)
Okay
Baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me mr.flintstone

I can make your bedrock

Baby, lets take a drive, top down
Underneath the Carolina sky
We can watch the fireflies
Try to outshine the stars
I wanna lay a blanket down
Find a way back
To where our love was found
Baby, lets go right now
Back to our hearts
Beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on, baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days
Don't worry about what to wear
Those faded cut off jeans are my favorite pair
Don't go messing with your hair
Let it all blow around
Move over in the middle by me
Just like you did
When your daddy couldn't see
Why his little girl loved a boy like me
Back to our hearts
Beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on, baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days
You remember cutting class
Heading to the creek
Doin' '95 down a two lane street
Staying up all night
Talkin' about forever you and me
I can see that look in your eyes
And if I know you, they don't lie
They're telling me
You're thinking about going back
About getting back
Back to our hearts
Beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on, baby, take my hand
Let's find a way back to our crazy days

It's the last night on earth before the great divide
My hands are shaking time was never on our side
And there's no such thing as a beautiful goodbye
As an ordinary day I prayed for you a thousand times
It's never enough
No matter how many times I tried to tell to tell you this is love
If tomorrow never comes I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
If tomorrow falls asleep can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth
A penny for your thoughts
A picture so it lasts
Let's knock down the walls of immortality
Your fingers on my skin only you can hear my fear
Only you can help me heal
I see forever with you here
It's never enough no matter how many miles stand between us this is love
If tomorrow never comes I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
If tomorrow falls asleep can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth
It's never enough
No it's never enough
(it's never enough)
Ooh
The afterglow
The horizon line
The shadows fall
Will you still be mine
Will you still be mine
Will you still be mine I ask
If tomorrow never comes I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
If tomorrow falls asleep can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on earth

Empty glass
Gets another round
Squeaky chair
Makes another sound
There is a gentle breeze
Playing in your hair
Come take a bow
While you're still
All there
It's what it is
It's what it was
It's what it will be here
After us
There is no memory
There's no recall
No recollections
At all
Your dark glasses
Sliding down your nose
Now bring these proceedings
To a close
It's what there is
It's what there was
It's what will be here
After us
Your dark glasses
Sliding down your nose
Now bring these proceedings
To a close
You can make it all worthwhile
You can lend yourself some style
You can give them all the reasons
Al the facts that you have seasoned
You can hear them hoot and holler
As you come across a scholar
You can set your name in lights
You can make two wrongs a right

You're
Happily Retired Now!
Hurray for you!
Happily Retired Now!
Whatcha gonna do?
There's books to read and golf to play
Naps to take, have fun all day
You're Happily Retired Today!
Hurray!
You're Happily Retired Now!
Hurray for you!
Happily Retired Now!
Whatcha gonna do?
All the kids must move away
There's nothing really left to say
You're Happily Retired Today!
Strike up the band and orchestra
We'll see you down in Florida
You're Happily Retired Today!
Hurray!
It's time for you to over sleep
And tell the boss to take a leap!
A flying leap!
Because you're Happily Retired Today!
Oh yes, you're Happily Retired Today!
It's true, you're Happily Retired Today!

The engines roared, the aeroplane soared
And I waited with baited breath for the worst
But everything connected, there was nothing unexpected
Until she appeared looking calm and collected.
I fell in love with an air hostess
Together we flew the skies with, Air France
I wanted to give her a copy of my record
But I did not have the self confidence
I fell from such a great height
And wonder if I will ever land?
I fell in love with an air hostess
Together we flew the skies with, Air France
I wanted to give her a copy of my record
But I did not have the self confidence
I fell from such a great height
And wonder if I will ever land?
He fell in love with an air hostess
Together they flew the skies with, Air France
He wanted to give her a copy of his record
But he did not have the self confidence
He fell in love with an air hostess
Together they flew the skies with, Air France
He wanted to give her a copy of his record
But he did not have the self confidence

Something causing fear to fly
Rising like a dark night
In silence
Traveling like a broken boat
Heading for the sky
And I'm an island
I watched you disappear into the clouds
Swept away into another town
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
The sun is in the east,
Rising for the beasts
And the beauties
I wish that I could tear it down,
Plant it in the ground to warm your face
I built myself a castle on the beach
Watching as it slid into the sea
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
Until the last of days
Through walls and harvest moons
I will fight for you
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
Until the last of days

We fell in love
On the first night that we met
Together we've been happy
I have very few regrets
The ordinary problems
Have not been hard to face
But lately little changes
Have been slowly taking place
You're always finding
Something is wrong in what I do
But you can't rearrange my life
Because it pleases you
You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free
If what you want
Isn't natural for me
I won't pretend to keep you
What I am, I have to be
The picture of perfection
Is only on your mind
For all your expectations
Love can never be designed
We either take each other
For everything we are
Or leave the life we've made behind
And make another start
You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free

Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love
God bless our love
Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting sun
When the day is done
God bless our love
God bless our love
Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end
World without end
Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love
God bless our love

So many faces stained with tears
deceit and confidence
are walking hand in hand
The need is great within itself
an itching sense is trying
hard to reach out
Stay with them this time
try hard to
stay with them this time
and try not to believe
that we're entwined in misery
The awful sense of hoplessness
is something that we'll have to
try to forget
It seems so barren to consume
we need a change or this is something
we will regret
Stay with them this time
try hard to
stay with them this time
and try not to believe
that we're entwined in misery
"Some other time"
"some other time"
"some other time"
The words are all the same

If I have understood correctly
Velocity equals the distance traveled
Divided by time
I've read every word ever printed
On quantum physics
And now it is time to try
I read your book, I found your notes
I dusted this thing off and turned on
The key
The rumbling motors
The buzzing incredible gadgets
The hissing electricity
And now the moment has come
I'm traveling back in time
They're running down the hall
I've started the countdown
They want me to stop
But I don't think so
I'm ready to go
Let's get the job done
Beyond the paradoxical
All the lights are dazzling
Pass the planes, and trains, and satellite navigation
Pass the time I spent today
Through the nearest wormhole
In a stunning ball
Of white
The light explodes and lands on you
And you're five
Always running away
And I was dying to kiss you
And I
I don't want to cry
I don't want to see
Where the moving van takes you
So I travel on
Beyond the stars
At one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second
I can fly
Forward a few years
To nineteen hundred and seventy nine
I caught a glimpse of the sky
They're coming down the road
They're coming to get me
I never should have come
I hide the time machine
I'm running down the hall
I think I'm in my old house
Pass the place where I grew up
Number nine Lake Road
Pass the swimming pool
And Mable park
And past Troy Clifford's house
To the Argonaut ?
To the fish and chip shop
Out the back and down the road
To the place I got beat up
Hey, put that rock down
Can't you see he's half your size?
Hey, he looks familiar
Oh my god, he's me, age nine
Put your shoes on
And run away from here
I can't get involved
This is all so weird
I'm meeting myself
This is all so clear
All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted
All I never did
All the dreams I had
All the things I would change
I can change them
All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted
I'm gonna make right
What I did wrong
And change how the future has come
Through appliance of science
I'll take a hold of my enemies
Take their obscenities
Kiss them, and leave them like lovers who've gone
I'll call my dad
I'll tell him I miss him
And tell my reflection: 'it's not your fault'
And now the moment has come
I'm traveling back in time
They're running down the hall
I've started the countdown
They want me to stop
But I don't think so
I'm ready to go
Let's get the job done
Put your shoes on and
Run away from here
I can't get involved
This is all so weird (It's me aged nine)
Let's get the job done
All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted
All I never did
All the dreams I had
All the things I would change
I can change them
Beyond the paradoxical
All the lights are dazzling
Pass the planes, and trains, and satellite navigation
Pass the time I spent today
Through the nearest wormhole
In a stunning ball
Of white
The light explodes into another moment

And so you've come back to me
And say the old love's growing, yeah
You've tried through all these weary years
You've tried too vainly to forget
Oh, no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives us back our youth
The loving heart, you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Come close and let me see your face
Your raven hair is tinged with snow
Oh, yes, it is the same dear face
I loved so many years ago
Oh, no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives us back our youth
The loving heart, you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Farewell, I think, I'll love yet
As friend to friend, God bless you, dear
And guide you through these weary years
To where the skies are always clears
Oh, no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives us back our youth
The loving heart, you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Oh, no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives us back our youth
The loving heart, you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Yours, my friend, in perfect truth

Yeah, yeah, okay
You say I don't treat you right
I say that you're too uptight
Then we have a stupid fight
I don't mean to hurt you but I do
Break up, and then take you back
Make you have a heart attack
Boom boom, there's a heart attack
I don't mean to hurt you but I do
Be my buttercup, be my star
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard
Even though I'm out, in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine
Be my lover boy, be my spark
Be my fire boy in the dark
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine boy
Just be mine, just be mine, just be mine, just be mine, boy
I want you like
Sometimes, I'm a crazy chick
Do things that'll make you sick
But I get away with it
I don't mean to hurt you but I do
You say that that I make you wait
That's true 'cause I make you wait
Just one of the things you hate
I don't mean to hurt you but I do
Be my buttercup, be my star
Beat it like a drum, beat it hard
Even though I'm out, in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine
Be my lover boy, be my spark
Be my fire boy in the dark
Even though I'm out in the night
Even though I'm wrong, just be mine boy
Just be mine, just be mine, just be mine, just be mine, boy
I want you like
I want you like
I want you like
I always messed up (I'm sorry)
Really mean it now (I'm sorry)
Just can't help myself (so naughty)
Uh uh uh, so naughty
I always messed up (I'm sorry)
Really mean it now (I'm sorry)
Just can't help myself (so naughty)
Uh uh uh, so
Oh
Boy
Oh just be mine
Oh, whoa
I want you like
I want you like

Who sleeps in beds when you've got the sunrise
Wasting time watching infomercials live on channel 9
Us and Billy Mays, nowhere else to rile
Stealing blankets, sleeping in a pile
They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse as to why we're still up
Just so we can feel a little bit better
About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step
On our door fucking step
Went to the house of some friends that I just met
Didn't feel okay so I bought some cigarettes
Tonight everyone's with everyone else getting it on
I'm alone asleep with my clothes on
Maybe still awake
They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse as to why we're still up
Just so we can feel a little bit better
About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step
On our door fucking step
Woke up with raccoon eyes and crackled face paint
From a night of campfires and MDMA
The sun comes over the hill in Joshua tree
Let's grab a bottle of wine, some of Jamesy's weed
If it's okay
They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse as to why we're still up
Just so we can feel a little bit better
About the neighbor's angry letter on our door step
They made the sunrise for people like us
So we have an excuse to watch it come up
It comes up

We were young and so inspired
We weren't the only ones who thought
We'd change the world
No sun would set without us
No one we knew could ever doubt us
We had our future figured out
We knew a love like ours would always save the day
And that we'd always be okay
[Chorus]
But would you know me now?
Would you lay me down beside you
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year?
You looked at me like no one else
But sometimes love just doesn't seem to conquer all
We search for someone else to blame
But sometimes things can't stay the same
[Chorus]
Holding on to the memories
Of when we were younger
I can't forget
'Cause when we were together
That's when I was at my best
And would you know me now?
Would you lay me down beside you
Tell me all the things I long to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year?
'Cause that was my favorite year

In a taxi chasing for the sun,
All around us strangers everyone,
With no hope for what they hope for,
We could drive all of our tears away.
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.
In a taxi ride that ends too soon,
The city skyline tries to kick the moon,
We have no time for what they wait for,
We can drive all of our tears away.
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.
You and I against the walled in generation,
You and I could kick the walls away,
We have no time for what they wait for,
We can run fast we can run far.
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.

Maginary girl
You lay awake in your bed
Speaking the words in your head
You think about what it means to be dead
You've got your wits about you
That's good, cause she's a vulture
You try to come up with a means to and end
Maginary girl
She comes on like the Gulf Stream
Like Devil's Night on Halloween
Now she's a total eclipse of the sun
She makes it obvious now
Her special weakness for
Softserve ice cream from the Dairy Queen
She's like twilight
In between day and night
Used to be grass roots
Now she's supernatural
She's like twilight
In between day and night
Used to be grass roots
Now she's supernatural
Maginary girl

me, I never keep any secrets from myself
I think I like the shame
just to say the words to the ones that I've hurt
it kills my pain
these are my hands that have
touched another man
these are my feet that are
drawn to the quick sand
chorus
I want to break
I want to fall
to be cut by
the jagged edges as I
learn to crawl
I'm not the one you think I am
I'm not the one you need
I'll only make you bleed
I'd give up everything I have
give up everything I am
to want you, the way you want me
these are my arms
that have held another tight
these are my lips
that he kisses well into the night
chorus
and yet he turns me so
I'll easily forget
all I have ever known
chorus out

Hello Daddy Baby
Hello Sexy Mama
[Verse 1]
Come on, bring your BAD self down here
I want to see you do your thing
Come on, come on
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Party time
[Verse 2]
You walk the walk, you talk the talk
We met by chance
Conversation's fine
But I haven't got the time
Coffee and small talk is the last thing on my mind
[Bridge]
We're doing it baby
We're out here on the floor tonight, yeah
No worries baby
Forget about the problems in your life
[Chorus 1]
Shake your bootie cutie
And show me you can dance
Come on, sexy belly baby
I want to watch you swing your pants, yeah
[Verse 3]
I'm a girl who likes to be kissed
I'm a sentimental freak
Who loves to get frisked
I'm not in the mood to analyze
But it's the way that you shake it
Not the shape or size
[Bridge]
We're doin' it baby
We're out here on the floor tonight, yeah
No worries baby
Forget about the problems in your life
[Chorus 2]
Shake your bootie cutie
And show me you can dance
Come on, sexy belly baby
I want to watch you swing your pants, yeah
Shake your bootie cutie
You are the dancing king
I'm Mr. Big, baby can you dig
You really make my thing sing
Shake that healthy butt
[Chorus 3]
Shake your bootie cutie
And show me you can dance
Come on, sexy belly baby
I want to watch you swing your pants, yeah
Shake your bootie cutie
You are the dancing king
I'm Mr. Big, baby can you dig
Every time you do it
You really make my thing sing
[Chorus 3]

I had a dream, there was a rainbow,
Over the mountains, over the sea
Just you and me, we were go walking together,
Watching the sunrise over the trees
Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo-Wa
Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Starshine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Star shine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
People like me, can always believe in
Love on an island surrounded by sea
We had a dream, of love never liven
But I know that love can't live in a dream
Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo-Wa
Wa-Oo-Wa-Oo
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Star shine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Star shine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
A-ha, have it all seems like magic (Have it all seems like magic)
Oh yeah (A-ha)
Dreams can come true (Dreams can come true), (Dreams can come true-oo)
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Star shine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Star shine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream but
True love, holding us together
Star shine, Fantasy Island
You know I wish that we could stay like this forever
Fantasy Island, you know we have a dream...

Why don't you sing 'I need you baby'?
'Cause it rhymes with crazy and it rhymes with maybe
It rhymes with lady and much much more
And it doesn't rhyme with the 'f' word
Well Simon le Bon stayed round my house before
And he was sick on the plants and he was sick on the floor
And he wouldn't go home until he'd sung his song
With a backing harmony from Paul Young
Shell we dance again?
In our special way
With our trousers round
our knees
Why don't your video have dancing girls?
With hips that curve and lips that curl
Legs are where the heartbeat starts
It's low in neckline and high in charts

Hey you know my friend Lisa
She's down from LA
We've been places like this
They're always the same
We'll loosen the rope just enough to Make you pay-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Say my memory is hazy
We're moving away
To rent a display home
Avoid all the grey
Two bees in a swarm
The honey's stuck us by the hair-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Hold music, hold music
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it, dare lose it
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it, dare lose it
When we're sleeping in daily
There's ice on the road
I bought us a dragon
To lighten the load
He's keeping us warm
The blood keep flowing to your head-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Hey I've never been stately
I'm legless at sea
My spirit has felt you since 1903
I'm trying to be normal
But there's evil in my head-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Hold music, hold music
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it, dare lose it
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it, dare lose it
You're so dangerous
Everybody's gonna hide out back
It doesn't matter that you're serious
Move along sad face your cover's blown
C'mon there you are
And we're outta space and you're out of space
I said change the beat fast
Or your enemies will see you naked
Hold music hold music hold
Hold music hold music hold
Hold music hold music hold
When we were out drinking
I found you a home
Four million in prizes
You left me alone
When we were forlorn
I found some poison in your bed-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Though you may mistake me
I'll never be free
I'm stuck in the crossfire
Between you and he
Tattoos on his arms
He got a needle for a head-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-hey-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Hold music, hold music
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it, dare lose it
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it, dare lose it
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me
Give it to me baby give it to me

Oh the first snowfall of the winter
Was a day that we all waited for
When it drifted to and frost
Why you should've seen the snow
It was near seven feet or more
By the old barn door
Oh the first snowfall of the winter
What a joy for a boy to behold
In each house you'll find a sleigh
That was waiting for this day
And of course, down the road a hill
For each Jack and Jill
Every winter breeze that scurries
Sets the snowflakes up in flurries
It's the good old sentimental season when
Folks put runners on their surreys
And forget about their worries
When a man becomes a boy once again
Oh the first snowfall of the winter
Jingle bells bring us spells ever dear
Under wintry skies of gray
It was snowing all the day
And it showed no signs of stopping
Every kid with eyes of popping
Will soon be belly-whopping on his ear

Reaching higher than towers
Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went
We had unbreakable powers
When our bodies meet, it's everything
This is was a beautiful vision
Even love was not a way you could describe it
And then there comes a collision
Nothing ever goes in the night
And they're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just spots
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?
Thought our love is insurmountable
He knows my heart is still aching
Never thought it would be caused by you
We're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just spots
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too
I know you think of me, too
I'll use this moment to really forget
I will soon, but for now
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
About you, about you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
About you, about you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on

facts round to false
statements state what you meant
the meaning gets lost under management
i've grown disinterested in numbers
the passing cars
of four-wheeled hearts
just exhaust and cancer
heard a whisper for a wishing
in a gas station i was thinking
about fuel force feeding
what was left wasn't much
unrelative and all out of touch
passion pushed off and never
never again bleeding red and real
now tell me how you fell
tell me how you feel
tell me how how
how do you feel now
imitating machines
before long with mechanical dreams
i'm not what you meant
you're not what i mean
dirty developments never go home clean

I felt picture perfect
On and off a shelf to a broken friend of mind, a broken friend of mind
It comes back and haunts me
A bullet undercover, it fooled me every time, it fooled me every time
But even if I lose it all
I've got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no
My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid
I will love you
Like I've never been hurt
Run through fire for you
Like I've never been burned.
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you,
I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt
You set fire to ashes
You fought through the darkness and brought me back to life, you brought me back to life
So even if I lose it all
I got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no
My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid
I will love you,
Like I've never been hurt
Run through fire for you,
Like I've never been burned
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you,
I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt
I will love you and forever
I will love you like I never
Like I never heard goodbye
Like I never heard a lie
Like I'm falling into love for the first time
Yeah
I will love you,
Like I've never been hurt
Run through fire for you,
Like I've never been burned
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you,
I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt

Succumb to the line
The finishing time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the corner
But I won't give up
Although I've stopped too
Before the end of me and you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchanged
Interpret the rooms
My tears in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
The ink is still drying
I told you the truth
And now I sigh too
The page turns on me and you
Across that white plain
The land is unchanged

You are my breath and I wait for You to come and rescue me
We will raise our hands and we will lift our eyes
To the hills where our help comes from
Where our help comes from
My God, how times have changed
There was a moment when I could call You friend
You gave me so much and I kept on taking
Now I am standing here and You don't recognize my face
What have I become that I can't call You friend
I never thought my walls would be stripped away
The way your love pours out it takes my breath away
Your hands have led me here and have never left my side
You leave me speechless
With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You
I need more of You because it's Your love
That has carried me through
The weight of the world seems to bring me to the ground
I know You're watching me above the clouds
I never thought my walls would be stripped away
The way your love pours out it takes my breath away
Your hands have led me here and have never left my side
You leave me speechless
With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You
With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You
With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You
With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You

You've got the words to change a nation
But you're biting your tongue
You've spent a life time stuck in silence
Afraid you'll say something wrong
If no one ever hears it how we gonna learn your song?
So come on, come on
Come on, come on
You've got a heart as loud as lightning
So why let your voice be tamed?
Maybe we're a little different
There's no need to be ashamed
You've got the light to fight the shadows
So stop hiding it away
Come on, come on
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers,
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it, oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
At night we're waking up the neighbors
While we sing away the blues
Making sure that we're remembered, yeah
'Cause we all matter too
If the truth has been forbidden
Then we're breaking all the rules
So come on, come on
Come on, come on,
Let's get the TV and the radio
To play our tune again
It's 'bout time we got some airplay of our version of events
There's no need to be afraid
I will sing with you my friend
Come on, come on
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers,
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it, oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah, we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
Now we're finally finding our voices
So take a chance, come help me sing this
Yeah, we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
And now we're finally finding our voices
Just take a chance, come help me sing this
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers,
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it, oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers,
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it, oh

Some people I know to lead fantastic lives
They never try to see
Just why they hypnotize
The truth I hear
Is not what I always see
They're praying hard that
Something happens to me
I wait for the water
I hope they'll drown
I've reasons in my head
For keeping myself down

There are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
For it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life
In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
For it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life
Oh wouldn't you believe me if I told you
That I love you, and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why don't you, why don't you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
Oh wouldn't you believe if I told you
That I love you, and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why don't you, why don't you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life [Repeat: x3]

You know tonight
I am feeling a little out control
Is this me
You wanna get crazy
Because I don't give a
I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
And If you really knew me
You'd know its not the norm
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it fuck you
The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this is my night
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm dancing a lot and I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls
Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it fuck you
The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
In the morning
When I wake up
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
But baby not tonight
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
Yeah, that feels good
I needed that
Get crazy
Let's go
That's right
Come on
Give it to me now, don't stop

Bless the day you came into my life, I still remember
Horny cowboy with your stars and stripes
Bringing the light into my day
With that Texan smile
Too afraid to love, to hope that you would stay
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
And you stayed forever and more
(I don't think that I)
Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December
All alone I watched the eagles fly
Even the light seemed to have changed
In the Californian sky
Through all of those battles then you came
Stepped out of the fading light
Said, "Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again,
Because I'm here to save your life"
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
But you stayed forever amore
And more, didn't you baby
Because I don't think that I could love and lose again
I don't think I have the strength
I don't think I have the strength
I don't think that I

How soon do we forget, how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same
Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh, how do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had
Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
You're, you're, you're, you're
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You're, you're, you're, you're
Mmm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

Oh, you think you found somebody that could treat you
(Like I did)
Spend the time doin' for you (Like I did)
And be there when you say, "I need you" (Like I did)
Now this I can't believe
Now do you really think she?ll hold it down for you
(Like I did)
Take all this foolishness from you (Like I did)
See, if she doesn't she will leave you (Like I did)
But don't come runnin' to me
Could have been you and me
But everything I feel is (Gone)
You had a good thing in me, now it?s (Gone)
The love I had for you is suddenly (Gone)
Go away from me
It could have been you and me
For actin' like my heart is (Gone)
And feel like a part of me is missin', it?s (Gone)
I didn't want to leave but I had to get (Gone)
'Cause he hurt me and now I don't
I don't need nobody
Who can't do right by me
I don't need you, baby
'Cause I'm worth much more you'll see
So just go 'cause I know
You cannot be faithful
Don't believe she's like me
Just do your thing
Never realize I really had a good thing (Like you did)
Then you'll realize you dogged me (Like you did)
But she never thought of cheating (Like you did)
Maybe then you'll see
It wasn't cool breakin' promises to me (Like you did)
Had no reason to deny me (Like you did)
How you claim you still act to me (Like you did)
And now it's easy to leave
Could have been you and me
But everything I feel is (Gone)
You had a good thing in me, now it?s (Gone)
The love I had for you is suddenly (Gone)
Go away from me
It could have been you and me
For actin' like my heart is (Gone)
And feel like a part of me is missin', it?s (Gone)
I didn't want to leave but I had to get (Gone)
'Cause you hurt me and I don't need
I don't need nobody
Who can't do right by me
I don't need you, baby
'Cause I'm worth much more you'll see
So just go ?cause I know
You cannot be faithful
Don't believe she's like me
Just do your thing
I know what you need
Don't care what you say
Gotta get away
I won't be second to no one
I can't live
With this choice I've made
Don't look back, no way
I can make it on my own without you
I don't need nobody
Who can't do right by me
I don't need you, baby
'Cause I'm worth much more you'll see
So just go 'cause I know
You cannot be faithful
Don't believe she's like me
Just do your thing
I don't need nobody
Who can't do right by me
I don't need you, baby
'Cause I'm worth much more you'll see
So just go 'cause I know
You cannot be faithful
Don't believe she's like me
Just do your thing
Could have been you and me
But everything I feel is (Gone)
You had a good thing in me, now it?s (Gone)
The love I had for you is suddenly (Gone)
Go away from me
It could have been you and me
For actin' like my heart is (Gone)
A part of me is missin', it?s (Gone)
I didn't want to leave but I had to get (Gone)
Just do your thing

When the lights go down on me
When the truth is hard to see
When hope is fading out of sight
Love is the only light
When my world becomes unreal
And the pain is all I feel
When I can't find the love I knew
It's sad but true
We find ourselves crying
'Cause we can't make it last
We hope for the future
Then reach for the past
When you find yourself alone tonight
Please believe me, love is the only light
When I find no reasons why
And it's time to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to say or do
It's sad, sad but true
We find ourselves crying
'Cause we can't make it last
We hope for the future
Then reach for the past
When you find yourself alone tonight
Please believe me, love is the only light
Burn my fingers, feel the pain
Kiss the flame and
Start again (start again)
And again (and again)
And again
And again, and again, and again
We find ourselves crying (we find ourselves)
'Cause we can't make it last
We hope for the future (we hope for love)
Then reach for the past
When you find yourself alone tonight
Please believe me, love is the only light
Love is the only light
When you find yourself alone tonight
Please believe me
Love is the only light

Sometimes I lock myself inside your closet
Breathe in the scent of your clothes
Take home a T-shirt and pretend I lost it
Hide it under my pillow, call me
Crazy, I'm crazy that way
Boy, I must be insane
Crazy, I'm in need, don't care what people say
I'm crazy that way, I'm crazy that way
Baby, I don't wanna talk about it
I got this feeling in me I know
There's no reason to deny or doubt it
Only thing that keeps me from going
Crazy, I'm crazy that way
Boy, I must be insane
Crazy, I'm in need, don't care what people say
I'm crazy that way
And my imagination runs away with me
I try and fight it but it's more than I can take
See the fire burning in my eyes and you realize
I'm crazy that way
Crazy, crazy that way
Boy, I must be insane
Crazy, I'm in need, don't care what people say
I'm crazy that way, crazy that way
La, la, la, la, la, la
I'm crazy that way

You say a man can change how he feels
To live by a plan
I find that impossible
Coz from the start
It's always been right
And here tonight
You know we're unstoppable
A crowded room is empty without you
But it light's up when you're around
In ways I never thought of
You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
Yeah night and day you're there to keep my feet on the ground
With a different kind of love
When we're alone, silence is right
You don't need to speak a word to convince me
And when we're close you take me away
That you feel the same, it's amazing
I can't imagine ever being without you
You're holding my heart in your hands
In ways I never thought of
You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
And when I'm down the words you say can turn it around
With a different kind of love
Yeah your love
You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
Yeah night and day you're there to keep my feet on the ground
With a different kind of love
You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
And when I'm down the words you say can turn it around
With a different kind of love

Turn up your radio now
I'm calling out your name
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back
We've both been acting strangely
And you can hardly face me
And I can see no fire in your eyes
We both know the answer
But one of us won't say it
Love's the only game in town
You sure know how to play it
The future of our love is on the line
The both of us could lose more than we find
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back
And if we think about it and come to the conclusion
That I want you, and you want me, we've come to the solution
And I cannot deny it, you were my perfect lover
If paradise is half as nice, I'd never find another
And now it's time, for making up your mind
The future is ahead don't look behind
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again
I want your love in my hands where I can feel it
Love in my heart, where I can keep it warm
Turn up your radio now
I'm calling out your name
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
The love we've got cannot be left behind
It's time for you to tell me that you're mine
So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby
When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again
I want you back in my life where I can hold you
Back in my dreams, where I can keep you warm
Here on my lips where I can
Taste your candy kiss

We've traded places times before
We were built for making love and not for war
I'm screaming fire! fire!
Watching from the door
I'm feeling burnt clean, under your eyes
Putting me out
Ooh ooh, baby don't hurt no more
Ooh ooh, keep from crying
Ooh ooh, baby don't hurt no more
Ooh ooh, Ooh baby don't hurt no more
And I feel it go
What we held so slow
Goes so quickly
And I need to know
All I need to know
Is the pain of lying
It's just a little too much on my mind, this time
It's just a little too much
On my mind
And I'm begging you please, singing
(Chorus)
It's not for you, It's not for you
It's not for you
Ooh ooh, ooh baby don't hurt no more
Ooh ooh, ooh baby don't hurt no more

Off to the races
I'm going places
Might be a long shot
Not gonna waste it
This is the big break
And it's calling my name
Yeah
[Chorus]
So far so great, get with it
At least that's how I see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, believe it
Can't take away this feeling
Taking a ride with chance to my side
Yeah, I can't wait
So far, so great
Might need to wing it
Still gonna bring it
Not gonna sink low
I'm going swimming
Swing for the fences
Sky's not the limit today
Yeah
[Chorus]
Everyone says don't get your hopes up
Learn the ropes and climb the ladder
I know in the end that just being here is the best
And it only gets better, it only gets better
[Chorus]
I can't wait
So far so great
Ba ba da da da ba da da da da
Ba ba da da da ba da da da da
Yow!

Word iz bond
Word iz bond
Word iz bond
Word iz bond
On and on
Word iz bond
On and on
Word iz bond
[Chorus: (x4)]
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
Woke up this morning
Chillin' on my head
Didn't want to wake my man
So instead I called my girlies
Let's chill today
Go out and play
Get in the car and let's cruise around the way
While the lead track plays
In the back so soothin'
The system is pumpin'
Got the kids on the block bumpin'
Just chillin' with my girls it's sumthin'
Got more funk in the trunk and it's funkin'
Me and the girls know the time before we enter
The center of my path finder
Flirtin' with the guys,cool with the girls
No members just just money
Or say in your world
Crusin' to the homebase
In Vegas where were livin'
Peace sign is up when we're ridin' through
Passin',hey how you doin'
This is how we do
'Cause we keep it goin' on
Word iz bond
[Chorus]
We be chillin' with the highest funk fashion
Donna Karen that's the gear we be wearin'
Pullin' out a list to get me back and get me fizzed
What I do when I chill with my crew
So just to get a shot to all my peeps on the street
We dedicate this song
On and on and on
To whom we've known so long
We gotta stay strong
Word iz bond
I shine like diamonds
On some straight Lariems
On the Benz glidin' through smoke foggy wind
Lay back in the Coupe
And tellin' ya smellin' like weed
Who creeps up on the side me
Talkin' all I need
Peep Dom P's in the bright pink and white rover
Pointin' to the nearest corner for shorty to pull it over
She cracked a smile,word iz bond
I almost crashin'
I blinked again and they was gone that fast
Word iz bond
[Chorus]

I'll get down on my knees
I'll do anything I can
I'll even walk upon water
I'll burn the soul of a man
I'm so sick with pain
I'm so sick with need
I'll lay before the cross and pray
I've done nothing to you
I'll bleed like holy rain
I'll say I'm searching for the truth
I'll rip the skin from God's face
If it can guide me to you
I'll give life to disease
I'll steal the light from Heavens gate
I'll give life to obsession
And then I'll do as I please
I'll give you one last sin or cure
I've got something for you

Don't need a miracle no matter what they say
Don't need the sunshine to make us feel okay
We got this on our own
Believe when no one cared
Have to shake off and let it go
And trust me we'll get there
We are more we are more than enough
Have no choice we won't give up
We are more we are more than enough
Don't you dare give up
We are fighters, strong survivors
Soldiers to the bone
We are champions, born to run the world
Gonna take it all
Fighters never fade away
Fighters never fade away
Don't let yourself down letting your sword fall
Keep your head up and hold it proud
We've come this far, after all
Now we got to hold our own
Stand up for what we can no longer bare
This is the path we chose
So close, we're almost there
We are more we are more than enough
Have no choice we won't give up
We are more we are more than enough
Don't you dare give up
We are fighters, strong survivors
Soldiers to the bone
We are champions, born to run the world
Gonna take it all
Fighters never fade away
Fighters never fade away
Let 'em come for us
We'll rise up
No we are not afraid
Try to take us down
Break us down
We are here to stay
Cause fighters never fade away
Fighters never fade away
We are fighters
Soldiers to the bone
We are champions, born to run the world
Gonna take it all
Fighters never fade away
Fighters never fade away

You wanna feel loose
You wanna see how I'm abused, I see
You wanna get faded
You never wanna concentrate on me
I'm too much of an angel
I'm too much of a saint though I can't be
I'm too much of a reject you don't expect much from
I wanna feel safe
I wanna feel like I'm not hated too
I wanna get closer I wanna feel the most I get from you
I'm too much of a rebound
I'm too much on the ground though you can't be
Your always getting higher
You don't desire me
So what have I got to prove
And what have I got to lose
When your not worth fighting for
And why am I feeling down
While your out messing around and you're
Not worth begging for
Just wanted to stop by
Just wanted to see you
One last time
Just wanted to say bye
Just wanted to get you off my mind
Just wanted to fit in
But then I saw you with him
So what have I got to prove
And what have I got to lose
When your not worth fighting for
And why am I feeling down
While your out messing around and you're
Not worth begging for
It's up to me, it's up to me
And I'm still falling
It's up to me, it's up to me
And I'm still calling
It's up to me
It's up to me
It's up to me and I'm still hoping
It's up to me for you to hold me
It's up to me to let you go
It's up to me
But for all you know
I'm already gone
So what have I got to prove
And what have I got to lose
When your not worth fighting for
And why am I feeling down
While your out messing around and you're
Not worth begging for
It's up to me
It's up to me
And I'm still falling
It's up to me
It's up to me
And I'm still calling

I called you on the phone
I said i was confused and in a daze
You said this uncertainty one day i would crave
So i wrote down exactly how i wanna live
And now it's a promise i'll never give
And it's a faint line
I'll trace to recreate
A semblance of love
Of some stability
It's just a faint line
I'll trace to recreate
A semblance of love
Of some stability
It's just a faint line
I'll trace to recreate
A semblance of love
Of some stability

Cold hands, warm heart
We just need some time apart
And everything will be okay
Oh no, not again
Why does it always happen?
It seems like every other day
You're too quiet, I'm too loud
Now we've rid a storm cloud
I'll see you on the other side
Old habits, young ways
Maybe we're just a phase
But we can say we really try
And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only see it this far
Well then I hate to say it, but it's obvious
I'm telling you, girl, there's no future for us
All talk, no action
So what's the big attraction?
And don't tell me it's "just because"
All work, no play
Don't wanna go on this way
I wanna go back to the way it was
And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only take it this far
Well then we've got to end it before it's too late
The love that is left turns quickly to hate
Cold hands, warm heart
We just need some time apart
And everything will be okay

It is not too late to carry on
So you've made mistakes, and here's another one
Oh, but you deserve another chance
Chasing 'round until you phase yourself
[Chorus:]
The world is flat and we're insane
And we have fallen off again
It really helps to know the way
What if you take more than you deserve?
(more than you deserve)
What if you give all and you get nothing back?
Sell your soul, nature's stereo
Take your favorite songs and sail away
The world is flat and we're insane
And we have fallen off again
The world is round and we are mad
And world opinion's where it's at
Don't make this so
Don't take the blow
The world is flat and we're insane
I won't be sad, I won't be sorry
I've no regrets and I don't worry
I'll roll this sail and I won't let go
I'd rather wait until tomorrow
There are some who do, and some do not (there are some who don't)
There are some who can't and we're the other ones
Shave your face, let your body go
Take your favorite songs and sail away

Oh alcazar

Celebration when we ring
The bells of alcazar
Celebration when we ring
The bells of alcazar

The mountains are steep and the valley's low
And already I'm weary but I have so far to go
Oh, and sorrow holds my hand and suffering sings me songs
But when I close my eyes I know to whom I belong
And who makes me strong
And I will be free, I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free, free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back 'cause he awaits for me
Oh, I will be free
A wise man, a rich man in pauper's clothes
A shepherd to lead us through the land of woes
Though many battles I have lost so many rivers yet to cross
But my eyes behold the Son who bore my loss and who paid the cost
I will be free, I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free, oh, free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back 'cause He awaits for me, oh
Oh, I will be free, oh
Oh and I'll dance on silver moonlight and I'll walk through velvet fields
Oh, and I'll run into the arms the arms that set me free
Oh, I will be free to run the mountains, I will be free
Free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back 'cause He awaits, oh
I'll never turn back
Don't you ever turn back
'Cause someday, someday we're gonna see
That we will be free

The dark's chasing you,
cause you to think life's untrue,
light never reached this far,
becoming who you are.
Painting maps on your wrists,
the unforgetable exists,
all this time waiting for change,
the rain's still pouring all the same.
Again you shake,
again you break,
your life feels like misery,
and bleeding a luxury.
You are so filled of fear,
every person, every eye stare,
but they'll never see through,
the walls built around you.
So tired and so weak,
whisper, scream and speak,
words is just a symbol of,
the dream of a life above.
Again you shake,
again you break,
your life feels like misery,
and bleeding a luxury.
You're not gonna make it this way,
you can't leave, can't run away,
a life in pieces waiting clear,
a burden you can't bear.
Again you shake,
again you break,
your life feels like misery,
and bleeding a luxury.

Ohhh
Chapter 1 tell 'em how the story goes
Every little thing that you said was true
I believed in you
But it wasn't meant to be
'Cause every little thing that you promised me
Wasn't honestly what you said would be, yeah
And I swear you'll never learn
So I'm giving you what you deserve
What you deserve
[Chorus]
You've been living in a fantasy
If you think that you could be with me
You tried, denied.
And now you've got to move on babe
Took a chance when you rolled the dice
Messed around, but you didn't think twice
What's done is done. I want you outta my life
Every time the phone rings, it's in your eyes
That you wear a disguise, oh who could it be
Who could it be?
How you think you can just take me back
But I'll never go back
To where we used to be
And you said you've changed 'cause you cried
But it's time for me to draw the line
Time for me to draw the line
[Chorus]
Ohhhh
I want you out of my life
Ohhhh
Riprock A.G.
BnG
I want you out of my life
[Chorus x2]

Could have been so easy
Could have been a friendly face

And It's something about the way (way that you talk)
Every time you say my name (I can't talk)
Ohh boy you know you got me (speechless)

To let you know this is what I want

Your 'fight them on the beaches' speeches make me despair
'Cause if there's one thing we can guarantee is you will not he there
Tidying your room, making up your bed
And if your diary's full that week you'll send us lot instead
Send us lot instead, put a poppy by my lovers bed
We believe you when you say you've hurt your back
Have you ever been away
Where were you when we took Calais?
You don 't know, you don't care
You 're just glad that you wasn't there
Have you ever been away
I'm afraid your Rule Britannia mania doesn't ring so true
If I was captain of the waves I'd turn the gun on you
Any last requests before you join dead?
I'll crap into your Union Jack and wrap it round your head
Wrap it round your head, take a look at all the blood we've shed
We'll believe you when you say it was worth it
Liberate the streets of Europe, give our kids a chance
Give them Beaujolais by tap and cheap day trips to France
But you have never seen or smelt this ungodly death
It's like the stench of roasted lamb upon your father's breath

I've been down a lonely street tonight
And I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me
The clouds cover up the Dublin sky
I don't know what's left of me
I don't know what's right with me
And I've tried to keep my distance
And I've sung Amazing Grace
I've tarnished all our memories
But there'll always be a trace of you
Of you
I remember laughing on that river's edge
Trying to get you to jump with me
Trying to get you to fall for me
And your trembling heart it beat so fast
Holdings hands you promised me
Holding hands we counted to three
And I felt your slipping fingers
And I saw you change your mind
If I hadn't dragged you in with me
You would have let me dive without you
Without you
They sent you all the way from Hollywood
And maybe that Dublin sky was changing you
It put diamonds in your eyes
I always thought we were going to make it through
But I wanted to hear it first from you
How many days am I going to regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all those years?
Held down by these tears?
How many dreams have I left deserted?
How many hopes have been diverted?
Have I been buried in the dirt?
Held down by this hurt?
How many loads did I let you hijack?
How many ways can I stand here in playback?
How did I end up lying here
Crying underneath the Dublin sky?
How many days am I going to regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all these years?
Drowning in my tears?
How many nights am I going to regret you?
How many days till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all these years?
Drowning in my tears?

I'm sinking under the weight of the water
Ease up, I'm ready to float again.
Seems like the world's neglecting to move; not asleep or sound.
And I watch the clock turn,
watch the clock churn... down.
I liked the Sun when its gaze was hotter.
For a time, darkness remained unseen.
Now I feel the shadows hunt for my mind, Am I asleep or sound?
But I'll watch the clock turn,
watch the clock churn... down.
And I watch the clock turn,
watch the clock turn,
watch the clock turn,
watch the clock turn...
And I watch the clock turn,
watch the clock turn,
watch the clock turn,
watch the clock turn...
I'm sinking under the weight of the water
Ease up, I'm ready to float again.
Seems like the world's neglecting to move; not asleep or sound.
And I watch the clock turn,
watch the clock churn... down.

Sky of ink and diamond stars
Empty streets of just occasional cars
Here we lie in a lullaby
Of the stillness in our room
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
All of the letters in all of the words
In all of the books all over the world
They're nothing but sounds and vowels and nouns
For talking to strangers, that's all they were
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Orchestra of tiny hearts
It's like pepper sprinkled on our hearts
We're threading a needle with boxing gloves
When we try and talk about love
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does

Wow oh baby (repeat)
Wow oh baby
Gotta make a little room for me to breathe
Gotta feeling that you're about to pull me in to deep
The more I try to walk away
The harder it gets to believe that I don't need you (oh no)
You've got a hold on me (there's no escaping baby)
Got to find the release (ooh)
Chorus
Why do I feel so weak
When you are near me
You've got me in too deep
So help me baby
You're living in my dreams
You're always with me
You're the dark in my light
You're the black in my white
And I'll always know you've got me where you want me
(you've got me where you want me)
You've got me tempted by what's forbidden
How can you be so sweet but uh so unforgiving
And I'm emotionally drained
Am I too gone to be saved
But I don't want it any other way
You've got a hold on me (there's no escaping baby)
Got to find the release (oh)
Chorus x 1
You pull me close
I can't let go
My hands are tied
You're all that I know
You pull me close
I can't let go
My hands are tied
You're all that I know (you're all that I know)
Chorus x 2
Why do I feel so weak
When you are near me
You've got me in too deep
So help me baby
You're living in my dreams

Woman, oh, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind, on your mind?
There's something wrong between us that your laughter cannot hide
And you're afraid to let your eyes meet mine
And lately when I love you I know you're not satisfied
Woman, oh, tell me, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind, on your mind?
I've seen the way men look at you when they think I don't see
And it hurts to have them think that you're that kind
But it's knowing that you're looking back that's really killing me
Oh, woman, oh, tell me, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind, on your mind?
A woman wears a certain look when she is on the move
And a man can always tell what's on her mind
I hate to have to say it, but that look's all over you
Oh, woman, oh, tell me, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
Oh, woman, oh tell me, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?

I seen highways in the rain
Waved goodbye to midnight trains
I seen sweet dreams disappear
All my life
I felt cold wind cut my skin
Waiting on ships that never came in
But I never cried real tears until tonight
If I should lose this love
If you should turn away
I couldn't bear to face
One more day
If I should lose this love
I couldn't stand the pain
I can do without better things in life and still get by
But if I should lose this love oh baby
I might just lay down & die
I staggered on the edge of hell
Stealing coins from wishing wells
And if the world went up in flames
What did I care
But when I look into your eyes
You know I suddenly realize
For the first time in my life baby I'm scared
If I should lose this love
If you should turn away
I couldn't bear to face
One more day
If I should lose this love
I couldn't stand the pain
I can do without better things in life and still get by
But if I should lose this love oh baby
I might just lay down & die

Hey, what's the silence for?
Lost in the herd that hides your eyes
Did you mean to run from me?
From the dreams, we have waited for
I want you to take me there
To The place that you cherished
Hope that light your world
Do I, do I, have to prove
That I am here for you
I hope you understand
Since you have been away
I have missed you so
I can't wait to hold you
Have you back again
So if you stop and turn around
Then you'll see me
I'll be there searching
Right there waiting for you
What is the anger for?
Wait, please don't turn away from me
Looking into my life
You know, that it means everything to me
I want you to take me there
To The place that you cherished
Hope that light your world
Do I, do I, have to prove
That I am here for you
I hope you understand
Since you have been away
I have missed you so
I can't wait to hold you
Have you back again
So if we stop and turn around
Then you'll see me
I'll be there searching
Right there waiting for you
No matter what you say
We'll get through each day
I am here to stay
If I need you there
Sometimes to weld
Then I'll be there
Since you have been away
I have missed you so
I can't wait to hold you
Have you back again?
So if we stop and turn around
Then you'll see me
I'll be there searching
Right there waiting for you
Since you have been away
I have missed you so
I can't wait to hold you
Have you back again
So if we stop and turn around
Then you'll see me
I'll be there searching
Right there waiting for you

I left school and hit the high street
Had my youth in six weeks flat
Top shelf dust and Glastonbury
Learnt to be a secretary
If I can't have it, nobody can
You follow the instructions, it's all part of the plan
When you start as you mean to go on
Lets get married, lets have children
Split up when we're twenty two
Cut our losses, screw our bosses
Get out while we're still young
If I can't have it, nobody can
You follow the instructions, it's all part of the plan
When you start as you mean to go on
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Paradise often falls apart
Home improvements for amusement
Smash this place to smithereens
Don't forget to pay the premiums
Go abroad, don't leave the gas on
If I can't have it nobody can
You follow the instructions, it's all part of the plan
When you start as you mean to go on
When you start as you mean to go on

There's no more little secrets we haven't yet disclosed
We bore the living daylights of anyone too close
And all our cards at Christmas are written to us both
Count them up who's got the most?
Said we'd be close
Said we'd work perfectly
Said that we'd toast
Beautiful company
Closer than a sister to her baby brother
Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother
It's too close for a lover
It's too close for a lover
We are each other
We are each other
We've been through all positions and this one's definitely best
You move Middle East and I'll move Wild West
What happened to our friendship we could easily have guessed
Add it up we're self-possessed
Said we'd be true
Said we'd be so so proud
Just me an you
We'd shout it out aloud
Closer than a sister to her baby brother
Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother
It's too close for a lover
It's too close for a lover
We are each other
We are each other
Remember we went shopping and we went by piggyback
I shaved all my legs and you grew hairs upon your back
Well no-one's ever been since to this lover's shack
It's a cul-de-sac
Said we'd be close
Said we'd work perfectly
Said that we'd toast
Beautiful company
Said we'd be true
Said we'd be so so proud
Just me an you
We'd shout it out aloud
Closer than a sister to her baby brother
Closer than a secret agent working under cover
It's too close for a lover
It's too close for a lover
We are each other
We are each other

I turned you into a secret
To memorize alone
To justify my behavior
Define who I've become
Every time I tell my story
I begin with you
And I recall the night when I, when I
When I broke in two
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were hiding our innocence, oh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were caught in the heat of it, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
I turned you into a reason
To keep myself tied up
So when I think that I'm crazy
It was you that screwed me up
But I don't wanna let you go, oh
No, I don't wanna let you go
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were hiding our innocence, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were caught in the heat of it, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
I told you I would always try to be brave
(I didn't mean it, didn't mean it, didn't mean it, didn't mean it, didn't mean it)
You told me you were happy making mistakes
(I didn't mean it, didn't mean it, didn't mean it, didn't mean it)
'Til it was too late
'Til it was too late
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were hiding our innocence, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were caught in the heat of it, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, oh

I used to sit right down and imagine
What it would be like
To have your loving arms around me
On a starry night
Oh but, I got tired of dreaming
'Cause dreaming is nothing to do
I got tired of dreaming
About you
My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
I'm gonna love you tonight
My guns are loaded
They're pointing at your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart
I used to sit right down and imagine
What it would be like
To have you lying there beside me
All through the night
Oh but, I got tired of dreaming
'Cause dreaming is nothing to do
And I got tired of dreaming
About you
My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
I'm gonna love you tonight
My guns are loaded
They're pointing at your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart
My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
I'm gonna love you tonight
My guns are loaded
They're pointing at your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart
My guns are loaded
You're in my sights

Mind stump. Here's my conclusion. Twelve phone calls and a postcard. This room is dim, why not turn the lights out. What more is it we're losing? I can't see you like this now. I'll just get bad impressions. See the world walking around trying to buy reasasurance. We want to know that someone hopes we're happy here. We want to read something saying tomorrow will be, something saying tomorrow will be better.

I took a bit of your love and held it deep inside
In calculating the reasons, you keep me SATISFIED
It's up to you for some love, around I'll make some time
I think I'm losing consciousness, I think I'm LOSING MY MIND
For you
Into the middle of all we had, be strong on me
We cannot fall tonight, no
Even when I'm gone away, you're one and all
Seen his thoughts
When you'll be strong, when I'll go
Oh no, this feels a mess, you got me paralyzed, baby
I'm tired of being alone, you will never see me again, no
Unless you're really alone
The beat goes on and on
ON AND ON
The beat goes on
We're haunted by the sight
Boom, boom, broken heart
Ghost of a lover gone
I don't wanna be a part
Girl, I don't wanna sing that song
The beat goes on and on, forever
ON AND ON
The beat comes back around
Boom, boom, got that start
Guys of another call
Oh, you don't wanna be alone
Girl, dancing in the night
I still believe I can never make it alone
Even when you can't deceive me
I know that we always fall
Because after all ??
Oh, no, this feels a mess
You got me paralyzed, baby
You will never see me again, baby
Unless you need me alone
No, no, you will never be alone

I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday
What's the problem?
You keep comin' in and keep comin' out and singin flat
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
What's wrong? What's wrong?
You're not concentrating
Yes, I am concentrating
No, you're not
I'm sorry, let's just do it again
Nonono, uh uh. What's the problem
There's no problem.
Dawn, what's wrong?
There's nothing wrong, Terry.
Kevin.
Mmhm
Please don't tell me it's Kevin.
Mmhm
Ew, Kevin Swahili, I knew it! He's got cooties.
And he's seeing Tamika right now
And everybody else
He is not seeing Raneka
He is.
How you know?
Wait a minute guys.
Wait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her, it sounds like it's
serious because we can't concentrate and get this right. So, let's deal with
the problem.
You see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk.
And it goes a little something like this - hit it.
Mmm.....
Baby girl (unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (a fool)
Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life
I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love, can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time, to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come
I've seen time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
(Give it up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
Give it up turn it loose
Turnin' it loose, baby

I'm gonna build a raft and set it on the water there
Hoping she will come, see the thing I made
What a thing I made
Today I'm gonna sail even if she doesn't show
The ocean can decide, love is like a wave
Love would never fail
Hope she gets here soon
I hope she isn't far away
But if she is, I'll sail anyway
Everyday that I love her I kill myself
It happens over and over, there's no one else
And I try to forget her but look at me
Giving everything away for free
And when I'm out at sea, I'm gonna write a song for her
I'll sing across the bay, hoping she will hear
Hoping she will hear
I think she's in her car and just above the ?
To hear my serenade reckoning her near
Reckoning her near
And then she's gonna swill
I didn't build my raft in vain
But if I did, we'll both drown anyway
'Cause everyday that I love her I kill myself
It happens over and over, there's no one else
And I try to forget her but look at me
Giving everything away for free
Giving everything away for free, free
Drown me, it'll stop the pain, if my love's in vain
'Cause I knew, I knew she'd never come
'Cause she couldn't bear the ocean
She couldn't stand the waves
So everyday that I love her I kill myself
It happens over and over, there's no one else
And I try to forget her but look at me
Giving everything away for free

I need someone to show a little kindness
If he can turn his hat, a little blindness
I know that I might seem a little nameless
And I can also be a little shameless
Do you know the way, I'm from out of town
I need a place to stay, someone to show me all around
A box of chocolates and a dozen flowers
Just a little mood to sit and think for hours and hours
I will take it all with little grains of salt
I make anything feel less like what it's not
Just say everything as if it's not been heard
I will listen hard, I'm hearing every word
Do you know the way, I'm from out of town
I need a place to stay, someone to show me all around
A box of chocolates and a dozen flowers
Just a little mood to sit and think for hours and hours
Do you know the way, I'm from out of town
I need a place to stay, someone to show me all around
A box of chocolates and a dozen flowers
Just a little mood to sit and think for hours and hours
Box of chocolates and a dozen flowers
Just a little mood to sit and think for hours and hours and

You see me sitting here
A smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things
Together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life
This world is not at ease
We seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me
To fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life
So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew
I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find
The answer to our life
Show me the way
Give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life

I can't sleep I'm incomplete
As long as you don't tell me baby
The one thing I need to know right know
If only you would, call me
And put on hold
Those dreams your lost in baby
Just let me know, let me know where I belong
I can't go on like this
I'm caught up in this twilight
Until you come around and set me free
[Chorus]
I don't want to hang on a string
I don't want to wait for you to ring
Tell me I can't read your mind
Don't keep me waiting
Keep me calling
Keep me hanging here on a string
Maybe, you hesitate
Twice shy, that's why your waiting
Maybe, I set my hopes to high
But all I want to, do now
Is hold you close
And tell you the way I'm feeling
It's like you got, you got a hold on me
I can't go on like this
I'm caught up in this twilight
Until you come around and set me free
[Chorus]
Every moment twenty 4-7
And everything in between
I wait for you to call me
I wait for you to tell me
I wait for you to set me free

It's so hard to say
How a love could end this way
The one that sed to care for you
Just turned and walked away
And it's so hard to find
To leave the pain behind
When all the things you're lookin' for
You're heart can't seem to find
I'll be the air that your breathe
I'll give the strength that you need
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I
You know you're not alone
Without a love to call your own
I'll always be right there for you
To help you carry on
A heart that's always true
Girl I'm giving mine to you
And everything you ever need
I promise I will do
I'll be the air that your breathe
I'll give the strength that you need
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I
Girl in all your sleepless hours
I will be right there for you
With a hand to hold
A heart to see you through
Each and every night
I will make it right
When life feels so wrong
Cause in my arms is where you belong
I'll be the air that your breathe
I'll give the strength that you need
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I

Julius Caesar came, saw, conquered, went away
'Cause it rained here all the time
Too many sniffs and colds
Got up his Roman nose
So he left it all behind for Eric the gardener to find
Eric the gardener
Eric the gardener will find Eric the gardener
Julius Caesar knew that when his life was through
Something of him would stay behind
Not in a Roman tomb or an Italian womb
But buried deep in English slime
For Eric the gardener to find
Eric the gardener
Eric the gardener will find Eric the gardener
Julius Caesar sleeps soundly beneath your feet
With the rest of humankind
Dig deep and dig some more
Dig to the planet's core
Dig 'til you've gone out of your mind
But all you will ever find is Eric the gardener
All you can ever hope to find is Eric the gardener

Eight o'clock and moving close
Now we're dressed to kill ready to go
'Cause tonight we're in the mood
So hold on tight
This roller coaster's cutting loose
There ain't no way we're holding back
Gonna raise the roof and that's a fact
So don't stop, no time to loose
Get on board, this hurricane is coming through
Raise your hands and get counted in
Swing your body, shake it down now
[Chorus]
So don't think twice
Join the celebration
First class ticket to a positive vibration
So feel the vibe all across the nation
Say yeah to the new groove generation
We're no angels there's no lie
We're gonna party till the end of time
If getting down is our only crime
We plead guilty and we're not afraid to do our time
Spread the word get ready to begin
Feel the power, here we go again
[Chorus: x2]
A little taste of heaven, can you feel it?
That's what you've been given
[Chorus]

In my head I hear a haunting melody
It reminds me of the way things used to be
There was a time when we had everything
We gotta stop living in that dream
No nothing remains the same
We can't hold on but baby, baby
We can change
Oh - we can change anything we want to yeah
Oh - we can change the world
And make it better
But first we gotta change together now
Oh baby baby we can change
There's a message in the falling rain outside
There's a message in the tears falling from your eyes
I swear we don't have to hurt anymore
Throw the old ways out and close the door
No, nothing remains the same
We can't hold on but baby, baby
We can change
Baby, when you're trapped something snaps
And you start to die
Living all those years with our fears and
You wonder why

What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
What can you do for me
Let me hear you say
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
What can you do for me
Well my mother always told me
Shouldn't wait for things above me
What goes up comes down
Now now girl
If the rings should fall from saturn
You'll find me skiing through manhattan
What goes up comes down
Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you
What can you do for me
Let me hear you say
Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you

When we go on our vacation
Gonna blow your imagination
What goes up comes down
Now now girl
Don't you feel intrepidation
Regarding my reputation
What goes up comes down
Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you

And any girl that touch

'Cause I don't give a fuck
Who are you to call my cell
Oh I'ma wish you well
'Cause any girl that tried has fell
Where my girls at
From the front to back

So don't play yourself
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well is you feelin' that
Put one hand up

Tryin' to take my man
See I don't need that

Anything that belongs to me
He is my
My property
So you must leave
(Repeat till end)

Star people
Counting your money till you soul turns green
Star people
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen
I do not count myself among you
I may be living in a dream
It's just seem to many of you
Can't help but hope
There's a difference between, you and me
You're a star
(I'm talking to you)
You're a star
Maybe your mama gave you up boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl
Star people
Never forget your secret safe with me
Just look at all wonderful people
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see
It's a dream
With a nightmare stuck in the middle
But where would you be
Without all of that attention
You'd die
I'd die
We'd die wouldn't we
(Well wouldn't we)
Big, big star
Should go far
Talk about your mother
Talk about your father
Talk about the people
Who have made you what you are
Talk about your teacher
The bully boy who beat you
Talk about the people who have paid
For that new sports car
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby
Do you have a little tale to tell
Is that why you're a star?
Is that what makes a star?
Nothing comes for nothing, baby
That fame and fortune's heaven sent
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling
When you can pay the rent
How much is enough?

My friends ask me if I'm doing ok
But it depends on if you've called today
So that means I'm not doing so good
And I'd forget you baby if I could
My friends ask me how I am tonight
And if I've heard from you I'll be doing a height
And that's the trouble with the situation
We go up and down, in and out of love, because
It's a circle game (it's a circle game)
I don't wanna play (I don't want to play)
I think I'm over it, then I hear you name,
I get lost in the sound and I can't find my way out
It's a circle game (it's a circle game)
Nothing's gonna change (nothing's gonna change)
Better half of me is telling me to lose your name
And I get lost in the sound and I can't find my way out
Everyday is different but it feels the same
My moods goes up and down with every move you make
If I could I'd get myself off this ride, and we'd be on the same
Page at the same time
It's a circle game (it's a circle game)
I don't wanna play (I don't want to play)
I think I'm over it, then I hear you name
I get lost in the sound and I can't find my way out
It's a circle game (it's a circle game)
Nothing's gonna change (nothing's gonna change)
Better half of me is telling me to lose your name
And I get lost in the sound and I can't find my way out
I want off of this merry-go-round
It gets hard to breathe
When your not here with me
And an hour can feel like eternity
So baby
What we keep going
Round and round and round we go
Where we stop we never know
Round and round and round we go
Where we stop we never know
Round and round and round we go
Where we stop we never know
Round and round and round we go
Where we stop we never know
Round and round and round we go
It's a circle game
It's a circle game (it's a circle game)
I don't wanna play (I don't want to play)
I think I'm over it, then I hear you name
I get lost in the sound and I can't find my way out
It's a circle game (it's a circle game)
Nothing's gonna change (nothing's gonna change)
Better half of me is telling me to lose your name
And I get lost in the sound and I can't find my way out

On the road
Holding on to the end of the rope
Have you lost your mind?
Where you left behind to find your way home?
To cries and lie
6 feet deep in lies
Can you hold your "now"?
Where were you when the lights went down?
And I will be right beside you
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
Look inside
See the misery deep in your eyes
Have you lost yourself?
Are you out of tears for the times you cried?
A heart of stone
Cold and left alone
Can you hold me now?
Will you still be here when the lights go down?
And I be right beside you
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
I'll do anything you want me to
(Oh, oh)
When you give it up I'll be with you
(Oh, oh)
When you feel afraid I'll pull you through
(Oh, oh)
I'll do anything you need me to
(Oh, oh)
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell
You're not alone
There is more to this I know
You will live to tell
You will live to tell

Our love's the sound
Of broken skies
Too blind to see
What lies inside
We love what shines
Before our eyes
Why can't we learn
What hides?
Waiting on the last train
Flicking through the highlights
Livin' in a suitcase
Positively uptight
Kissing in the full moon
Drowning in the sunshine
Walking on a tightrope
And everything is gonna be just fine
'cause I believe in your heart of gold
Automatically sunshine
Yeah glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
And we believe that there's a heart beats on
In the dark of the close down
Yeah glitter, glitter everywhere
Like working in a goldmine
And time not tied
Is time to feed
We lose our pride
We spill our seed
The worst of us
Escape so slow
The best of us
Just goes
They'll make you work for everything
Never let it roll
Never let it swing
Take control and let your heart sing

Sweat, sweat, 'cos Im a poisonous pill
Pop me in your mouth, baby, sit and be still
Not yet, I aint through wit you, girl
Put me in your glass, baby, give me a swirl
Dont stop, dont let it
(Oh)
Freeze up your trembling limbs
Dont you regret it
(Oh)
'Cos you can bet that this wont
Even ever happen again
So hold me close tiny dancer
The only thing Ive got is this electro rock cancer
I saw a picture on the canvas
Baby's got a ciggy in her lips and now shes cancerous
Yes, yes, in your tight white dress
Youre all alone and Im about to microphone check
Oh, yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electro rock and steady now clear
Yes, yes, in my tight white vest
Youre all alone and Im about to microphone check
Oh, yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electro rock and steady now clear
Sweat, sweat, 'cos Im a poisonous pill
Pop me in your mouth, baby, sit and be still
Not yet, I aint through wit you girl
Put me in your glass, baby, give me a swirl
I am ecstatic, hat full of magic tricks
You are kinetic, slow down, baby
Don't leave me so quick
So hold me close tiny dancer
The only thing Ive got is this electro rock cancer
I saw a picture on the canvas
Babys got a ciggy and he let her know shes cancerous
Yes, yes, in your tight white dress
Youre all alone and Im about to microphone check
Oh, yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electro rock and steady now clear
Yes, yes, in your tight white dress
Youre all alone and Im about to microphone check
Oh, yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electro rock and steady now clear
Steady now, steady, steady now, clear

Verse 1:
It seems like the longest
Before I remembered
that you haven't paged me
And I'm about to go crazy
Why can't I address this
I'm not on your guest list
Is it another chick
Let me know if I am ditched for her
And I came across your mind
I know I did I know I had to
And I know you value our time
Cause other wise we wouldn't have gone this far
And I spent my nickels and dimes
Just tryina be wherever you were
And you still ignore me now
Ooh you still ignore me now
I'm the only one that will be down
Chorus:
I want you to adore me
Place no girl before me
I should be the only
The only shoulder you lean on
When you cry and you're lonely
You got my digits call me
There's no denying
That we both have caught the eye
[Repeat Chorus 2x]
Verse 2
I took the stuffin' out the teddy bears
That you bought for me last year
And you're the one to blame
Cause you still haven't changed your ways
What you think this is funny
Boy you still owe me money
And I know you're feeling me
But you persist to play your games
And I came across your mind
I know I did I know I had to
And I know you value our time
Cause other wise we wouldn't have gone this far
And I spent my nickels and dimes
Just tryina be wherever you were
And you still ignore me now
Ooh you still ignore me now
I'm the only one that will be down
down...
See
Let me tell you something
I trusted you
and you know what you did with my trust?
You threw it away
I'm a tell you something
Boy, that's not how I opereate.
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Chorus]

True love is indispensable
Or we will fail
Yeah, I may look available
But I'm not for sale
I'm not gonna be a possession
So your friends will stare
Every time we make a connection
Do you feel it down "there"
People talk about money...
There ain't no shame in that
If I let the cash run me
There ain't no turnin' back.
Gold chain
You want me hanging like a gold chain
But I can't stand this
All day everyday keeping me swingin'
Cash ruled everything from the beginnin'
Your Gold chain
And I won't stand for
Back, forth, can't-be-sure, never committed
Cuz when the money's gettin' low,
Easy come, easy go...
My heart is not disposable
Handle with care
Good looks, good grades, I got 'em all
Do not go there
It's time to make a selection
What you gonna do?
Now will your bling obsession
Get the better of you?
People talk about money...
There ain't no shame in that
If I let the cash run me
There ain't no turnin' back.
Gold chain
You want me hanging like a gold chain
But I can't stand this
All day everyday keeping me swingin'
Cash ruled everything from the beginnin'
Your Gold chain
And I won't stand for
Back, forth, can't-be-sure, never committed
Cuz when the money's gettin' low,
Easy come, easy go...
Don't wanna feel my cold shoulder
I don't mind if you ain't got the dollar
If you lose the warmth, it's gonna be over
I want it back again...
Free of all the gold chains...
Gold chain
You want me hanging like a gold chain
But I can't stand this
All day everyday keeping me swingin'
Cash ruled everything from the beginnin'
Your Gold chain
And I won't stand for
Back, forth, can't-be-sure, never committed
Cuz when the money's gettin' low,
Easy come, easy go...

As we stand at the edge of the world,
Our hearts will journey.
For the light at the edge of the world.
Forever calls.
.
And though are travels may be lost and wandering.
From the dawn at the edge of the world,
One voice calls to you.
Fire may burn, and the sky may thunder,
Heroes crumble, and the sun will fall.
As the river circles on its endless journey
I will follow you.
Fire may burn, and the sky may thunder,
Heroes crumble, and the sun will fall.
As the river circles on its endless journey
I will follow you.
As we stand at the edge of the world,
There's a voice from the dawn of the world.
As the rivers encircle the world
I will follow you.

Follow blind
Heavy eyes hold position
You were right on time
It was a lucky prediction
Move on, move on
It's like the clock is pacing
The break of dawn
And our hearts are racing
Move on, move on
There's nothing changing
Don't undermine
My new resolution
Just to find
A different light, a new direction
Move on, move on
Now the record's skipping
I won't forget, I won't forget
The way you said
Move on, move on
There's no point in waiting
Move on, move on
It's like the clock is pacing
The break of dawn
And our hearts are racing
Move on, move on
There's nothing changing
Move on, move on
Now the record's skipping
I won't forget, I won't forget
The way you said
Move on, move on
There's no point in waiting
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah

Life in mono
The stranger sang a theme,
From someone else's dream
The leaves began to fall
And no one spoke at all
But I can't seem to recall
When you came along
Ingenue,
Ingenue,
I just don't know what to do
The tree-lined avenue
Begins to fade from view
Drowning past regrets
In tea and cigarettes
But I can't seem to forget
When you came along
Ingenue,
Ingenue,
I just don't know what to do
Ingenue, I just don't know what to do X5

Nobody cares, no one's concerned
We all stand watching while the city burns
Some are jumping from the windows.
Some are crying in the street
And the situation's worsening
While the chasms getting deep.
They outlawed compassion
They tarred and feathered hope.
The Church cried out "Have mercy!"
While hanging from a rope
But the gunman shouts the loudest
And the people listen well
While the city keeps on burning
In the rising flames of hell.

Get down
(hey-hey)
Hey-hey
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This how we get down
New in the neighborhood
Looking good to me
She's by your side,I can't deny
Got to know your name
You turn around,you see me now
I think its love I've found
My friends think I'm crazy
But I don't care cause baby I get down
[Chorus]
I get down like dat
Be like dat
I won't fret
She's no threat to me
(It may seem wrong but it's all about what I want)
Can I be like dat
It's on like dat
I won't get ya
If I like what I see,yeah
Da-da-da-da hey hey
[unknown] own my mind
I think your fine but you're with her
(And I don't care)
Can't let you get away
I want you just because
(She pulls you turns you,try's so hard to take your eyes away)
It's too late and you know it
'Cause I got you in a daze
[Chorus]
Tell me am I wrong
To go for what I like
When she holds you tight
You want me,it's only right
And I don't care
Her name1 is not step to you
That means she don't own you
I'm gonna make you mine
[Chorus: x2]

We're finally home at last
I've waited for this day to come
There's just something about you that rubs me wrong
You're not worth my attention
I built this with my own two hands
If you could sever the ties and stop using me as your next misconception
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent forever, it haunts me
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent forever, it haunts me
It won't be long before you meet your end
You're nothing more than a passing frame
So keep those cameras rolling
You think I wouldn't remember?
You're just another whisper in myself
You can spare me the lies
You don't believe in me
Your life's a contradiction
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent forever, it haunts me
Move
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever
And I wont forget the days that we spent forever, it haunts me

I remember the moment you told me, our love was lost and ooh...
How it split me in two pieces, never thought you'd be so cruel.
So calm and so cool, stop for a second and see.
Can you see, can you see?
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking on the sunny side of the street.
In the sunshine, in the sunshine.
Well, I guess I was wrong when I thought I heard my heart say
That you must be the one, 'cause it's only a couple of weeks now.
And it's already gone, yes, she's already gone.
And now I'm moving on and on and on.
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking on the sunny side of the street.
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking on the sunny side of the street.
In the sunshine.
You said it was over, over, it's over, you said it was over.
I'm not the one looking over your shoulder.
You said it was over, over, it's over, you said it was over.
I'm not the one looking over my shoulder, looking over your shoulder.
Stop for a second and see.
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat.
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking on the sunny side of the street.
Me that's walking, me that's walking on.
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking on the sunny side of the street.
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat.
Oh, look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking on the sunny side of the street.
Is my heartbox, is my heartbox missing a beat?
In the sunshine, in the sunshine, feels all right.
In the sunshine, in the sunshine, in the sunshine, feels all right.

It's over boy
Everyone can tell
No need to hide it from your friends
It's sad, but it's true
You've got your self to blame
And you (and you)
Will never understand
Don't try to talk me into it again
I will believe it when I see it
With my own eyes no more lies
I will believe it
When I receive the love that makes me feel alive
I will believe it when I see it
With my own eyes no more lies
I will believe it
That I can feel your love so now I realize this is goodbye
This is goodbye
Let's face it boy
It wasn't meant to be
You and me
Don't you understand
Don't try to talk me into it again
I will believe it when I see it
With my own eyes no more lies
I will believe it
When I receive the love that makes me feel alive
I will believe it when I see it
With my own eyes no more lies
I will believe it
That I can feel your love so now I realize this is goodbye
This is good bye
This is good bye

No Santa this morning
I guess my note got through
I told him quit calling
'Cause all I want is you
Gotta get a minute
Gotta get you on your own
Your baby sister's sleeping
And your daddy's on the phone
I'm sure you're hiding something hot
You wanna give to me
And not another pair of socks from
Underneath the tree
Oh, oh, you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Oh, oh, I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours
No stocking this morning
But that don't make me blue
There's one thing I'm wanting
That I can only get from you
Gotta get a minute
Gotta get you on your own
Your baby sister's sleeping
And your daddy's on the phone
I'm sure you're hiding something hot
You wanna give to me
And not another pair of socks from
Underneath the tree
Oh, oh, you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Oh, oh, I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours
Oh, oh, you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Oh, oh, I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours
Don't get crazy, Santa baby
You know I'll always leave a little treat for you
It might sound stupid but I need cupid
More than all the presents that I think I'm due
Oh, oh, you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Oh, oh, I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours
Oh, oh, you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Oh, oh, I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours, baby

Just as much as ever
I need you and want you to be here
Just as much as ever
I love you, and always will, my dear
Even though we two are parted
My feelings for you never drop
For loving you is something I started
And don't know how to stop
Just as much as ever
I'm hoping that you'll be mine again
Darlin', 'cause I'll never be satisfied till then
For I am still the same old me
With the same old love for you
Just as much as ever, my heart beats for you
(Just as much as ever)
(I'm hoping that you'll be mine again)
Darling, 'cause I'll never be satisfied till then
For I am still the same old me
With the same old love for you
Just as much as ever, my heart beats for you

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long.
Looking back I could have played it differently
One of few more moments who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well.
Wasn't it good? Oh so good
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me
More She needs security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well.
No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide.
Looking back I could have played it differently
Could have played things some other way.
Learn about the man before I fell
I was just a little careless
But I was ever so much younger then.
I was so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well
Wasn't it good? Oh so good
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?
Didn't I know how it would go?
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart?
Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
More She needs security
He needs his Fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took time to understand me
I know him so well.

I could feel you reaching out for me before we ever touched
And I knew you would always be someone I could trust
I felt your presence through the good times and the bad
You kept the faith you always had
When you saw me getting nowhere
Trying to find a new direction
For a stubborn little voice that said
I didn't have a prayer
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings and you were there
I felt like I was falling
Falling over the edge
And in this new altitude
I couldn't catch my breath
I turned my face to heaven
And it was then I realized
My guardian angel was here by my side
When you saw me getting nowhere
Trying to find a new direction
For that stubborn little voice that said
I didn't have a prayer
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings and you were there
This song belongs to you
And you know every word is true
I always knew that I'd be lost without you
When my star began to fade
And I found the stage was bare
I looked into the wings
I looked into the wing
I looked into the wings
And you were there

Whoa, girl if I didn't have a plan could I be yo man still
And if you couldn't watch cable would you able to understand and
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings take you out things or do nothing
Special would you deal would stick around and chill would you keep it
Real
[Chorus]
Tell me would you be here if I had nothing, Would you be here if I was
Struggling, if I had nothing, would you be here at any cost, would you
Be here if I didn't have a boss at any cost , would you be here to pay the rent
Would you be here no benefits, girl if that was it, would be here if I gave up
Straight outta love, would you give a what
Girl if all hope was gone, we didn't have a phone, would you stay at home with
Me and how long would stay by my side if I applied and wasn't qualified
Baby What if I was finished couldn't do nothing else with it would you forget it
Girl do you swear to tell the whole truth nothing but the truth I'm listening
Baby
[Chorus]
The day may come when things ain't going to good so for our sake I
Gotta be sure who I'm choosing is all the way wit it (yeah) and down the
Line I don't wanna get caught in a stick situation cause you never know might
Not be so cold might get a little older(ooh)
[Chorus: x2]
What if I was ugly and struggling and crummy would you love me
If I was rusty a little dingy would you defend me
If I was ugly and struggling a bunny would you love me
If I was rusty and struggling would you hug me (ooh)
[Chorus]

I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here
Where I can
[Chorus]
Run as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better
You keep makin' me ill
You're makin' me ill
[Chorus]
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills, they were different
Maybe I should get some help
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here
Where I can
[Chorus x2]
Where I can
[Chorus]

I'm lost for words this time
I'll spend my life looking vainly
So hard to find my place in this world
This world
If I could see a possibility
If I could see (if I could see) you here with me
I can't, can't wait, got lost in the forest
So blind, oh so blind
Even though there you are
If I could see a possibility
If I could see (if I could see) you here with me
If I could see, it would be so
If I could see, it would be so
So complete
You and Me

Flaxen, the dress is born
Crush a crushing stone
Tie a starching walls
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Flaxen, the dress is old
Fingers, this dress is tied
Tie a starching walls
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a

Ready to embrace the day as we both break.
When the light stole in it found me wide awake.
Wasted from a sleepless night, I reach to touch your hair.
Withdraw an empty hand, for you're no longer there.
In between the silence, leaving is an empty space.
Save the ticking of a clock
Whose hands are sweeping past its face.
And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.
But as I look around me, I just feel that way for you only.
I turn my hand to something that would clear my head,
But I could not forget the parting words we shared.
I opened up my mind to all the pictures I could trace.
But I could not recall the contours of your face,
And, oh,
He slipped away before I had the chance to say,
"If I did something wrong, please tell me;
I'll accept the blame."
And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.
For you only.
And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.
For you only.
In between the silence, leaving is an empty space.
Save the ticking of a clock
Whose hands are sweeping past its face.
And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.
For you only.
And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.
For you only.

So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting
The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
I wouldn't change a thing that happened
On my way to you...

Lady of Spain, I adore you
Right from the night I first saw you
My heart has been yearning for you
What else could any heart do?
Lady of Spain, I'm appealing
Why should my lips be concealing
All that my eyes are revealing?
Lady of Spain, I love you
Night in Madrid, blue and tender
Spanish moon makes silver splendor
Music throbbing, plaintive sobbing notes of a guitar
While ardent caballeros serenade:
Lady of Spain, I adore you
Right from the night I first saw you
My heart has been yearning for you
What else could any heart do?
Lady of Spain, I'm appealing
Why should my lips be concealing
All that my eyes are revealing?
Lady of Spain, I love you

ba ba ba ba
we never know what's coming next
i have no clue, i just continue
and gather scenes for my next guess
in from the rues, an artifice
to place an installation now
for all to come, and bring what they think about
you define then torn apart
the recognizable shapes froms its space when it
starts!
we waited for this day to come
and now it's here so we can leave when we cannot
you know it just because
that speech you wrote, you won't give up
so stand beside insidious ones
with conquered eyes, the things that they're living on
suicide, your repertoire
they criticize us, to create this relation to
us!
go!
you're a fiend!
go!
you old fiend!
move on
move on

When you're a little girl, the future looks so bright
No one ever tells you that it hurts to live
And things don't always have to turn out right
No one ever tells you 'bout love and how it can make you cry
No one ever tells you how your heart can break
When someone that you love tells you goodbye
And when the pain begins and the teardrops start to burn
No one ever tells you how it hurts to live
No one tells you you just live and learn

I lost my keys in the great unknown
And call me please 'cause I can't find my phone
This is the stuff that drives me crazy
This is the stuff that's getting to me lately
In the middle of my little mess
I forget how big I'm blessed
This is the stuff that gets under my skin
But I've gotta trust You know exactly what You're doing
It might not be what I would choose
But this is the stuff You use
Forty-five in a thirty-five
Sirens and fines while I'm running behind
Whoa
This is the stuff that drives me crazy
This is the stuff that's getting to me lately
In the middle of my little mess
I forget how big I'm blessed
This is the stuff that gets under my skin
But I've gotta trust You know exactly what You're doing
It might not be what I would choose
But this is the stuff You use
To break me of impatience
Conquer my frustrations
I've got a new appreciation
It's not the end of the world
Oh Oh Oh
This is the stuff that drives me crazy
This is the stuff
Someone save me
In the middle of my little mess
I forget how big I'm blessed
This is the stuff that gets under my skin
And I've gotta trust You know exactly what You're doing
It might not be what I would choose
But this is the stuff You use
Oh oh oh oh
This is the stuff You use

Son bella pastorella, che scende ogni mattino,
Ed offre un cestellino di fresche fruta a fior
Chi viene al primo albore avra vezzoso rose
E pmo rugiadose, venite al mio giardin.
Son bella pastorella, che scende ogni mattino
Ed offre un cestellino di fresche fruta a fior.
Ah.
Chi nel notturno orrore smarri la buona via
Alla capanna mia ritrovera il cammin
Venita, o passagiero
La pastorella e qua
Ma il fior del suo pensiero
Ad uno sol dara! Ah.
I am the beautiful shepherdess,
who descends every morning,
and offers a basket full of
fresh fruit and flowers.
Who comes on the first harvest
will have nice roses
and very good pommels
come to my garden.
I am the beautiful shepherdess,
who descends every morning,
and offers a basket full of
fresh fruit and flowers.
Ah.
which during the frightened night
the right way is lost,
in my shelter
you will find the fireplace
come, oh passer-by
the shepherdess is here,
but her inner thoughts
will only be given to one!
Come, oh passer-by,
the sheperdess is here,
but her inner thoughts
will only be given to one!
Ah.

There's a gap in the world
Only love can fill
And we can bridge that gap
If we have the will
No it won't be easy
We'll need help from above
But if everybody pitches in
We can build a bridge of love
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
Hand in Hand
Side by side
That's what it's gonna take
Then one day we'll cross that
Bridge to a better life
And we'll leave behind us
That old world of strife
When we reach our new world
Hate we'll never fear
And I bet if we could see God's face
He'd be smiling from ear to ear
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
Hand in Hand
Side by side
That's what it's gonna take
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
Hand in Hand
Side by side
That's what it's gonna take
Let's build a bridge of love
Across the sea of hate
From nation to nation
Standing through each generation
Let's build a bridge of love

Every minute I come home
And turn on all the lights
I still see you in the shadows
Even when it's bright
Put music on the radio
Play it way up high
I can hear you in the silence
And all I do is cry
Changing, places
But I'm always looking for you
In that endless sea and faces
What am I gonna do
I keep running
Going nowhere
I can't leave your love behind me
I keep running
Never moving
Getting lost so you can't find me
I keep running
Slow motion
Hoping someday yeah soon I'll see
I'll see
You'll come running on my darling back to me
Every morning I wake up
And try to turn on the pain
Sunlight in my window
Might as well be rain
Driving after midnight
To help my heart up wide
Your memory keeps tearing
At the edges of my mind
Starting over
But I'm always thinking of you
Oh fewer
Farther
What am I gonna do
I keep running
Going nowhere
I can't leave your love behind me
I keep running
Never moving
Getting lost so you can't find me
I keep running
Slow motion
Hoping someday yeah soon I'll see
I'll see
You come running on my darling back to me
Changing, places
But I'm always looking for you
In that endless sea and faces
What am I gonna do
I keep running
Going nowhere
I can't leave your love behind me
I keep running
Never moving
Getting lost so you can't find me
I keep running
Slow motion
Hoping someday yeah soon I'll see
I'll see
You come running on my darling back to me
I keep running
Oh

Well I'm convinced that underneath that black hair
There's a listening device planted there
And there's a man who follows me everywhere
And I shouldn't care
I sit and watch as the world takes shape
In streaks of color and fields of rage
Until the lions are burned at the stake
It's a choice that we all have to make
It's a choice that I'll have to make
[Chorus]
Eyes on the horizon
The sun is so blinding
And it's not so surprising
That it's nowhere
It's nowhere
But you're so happy to be there
Whatever happened to the boy next door?
We never see him around anymore
I heard he drowned and washed up on the shore
Or maybe somebody evened the score
Or maybe somebody scored
I found a tracking device in my shoe
Isn't there something that someone can do
I trust no one and especially you
You told them everything that you knew
(everything that you knew)
You told them all that you knew
(told them all that you knew)
[Chorus]
Here I am and it's nowhere again
And your eye's on me and your hand is a pen
And you're writing it down but you don't have an end
It's so good to be here with my old and familiar friend
Nowhere
Well I'm convinced that underneath that blond hair
There's a listening device planted there
And there's a man who follows us everywhere
And we shouldn't care
No we shouldn't care
No we shouldn't care
Eyes on the horizon
And it's only thunder and lightning
And it's so very frightening
And again you're surmising (And again you're surmising)
That it's nowhere (That it's nowhere)
Oh, but you're still happy to be there
Oh, nowhere
Nowhere (Nowhere)
Nowhere (Nowhere)
Nowhere (Nowhere)
Nowhere (Nowhere)
You told them all that you knew (Nowhere)
I found a tracking device in my shoe (Nowhere)
Isn't there something that someone can do (Nowhere)
I trust no one and especially you (Nowhere)
You told them all that you knew
Nowhere

On this New York City day
Kiss me goodbye at the gate
My plane is waiting to take me away
One more time i breathe you in
Dont know when Im back again
Just say youll be waiting.
waiting, waiting
Baby, were onto something
Miles and minutes melt into nothing
Im on the other side, of the world tonight
But in this heart of mine Im on New York time, Im on your time
The paris air the streets of Rome
Don't feel the same when Im alone
Youre still the place I want to call home
And i'll be counting every second til the moment that you're in it
Just say youll be waiting (waiting)
And Ill be waiting
Baby, were onto something
Miles and minutes melt into nothing
Im on the other side, of the world tonight
But in this heart of mine Im on New York time, Im on your time
And Ill be just killing time under these skies
til I see the city skyline in your eyes
And Ill be waiting.
Baby, were onto something
Miles and minutes melt into nothing
Im on the other side, of the world tonight
But in this heart of mine Im on New York time, Im on your time

I come disguise I was hypnotized
Lost a track, struggled back
I wanted easy stuff to please me
Something in the dark began to squeeze me
Seen it, there, then there in the mirror
Totally focused, no hocus pocus
Dare I give in to this thing gripping my skin
To win, thinking how to
As
The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams
Come out
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
I lie down in the dust just under your eye
A scrap of paper, thin as vapor
Filling my clothes like smoke
A couple of the wires in my heart are broke
I throw, I miss, something, nothing
But dreams, schemes, moments wasted
Taste I tasted
Fate I'm fated
Re-edited again then copy pasted
As
The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams
Come out
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
When I wanna quit, I suffocate it
I chew bubblicious, stress repetitious
Vicious, I'm one outsider
Up above the streets on the DCY-er
Higher, fire in my guts
In a rut, but what I've got
Is in no can, no other human
But I do get lonely, scared I'm phony
As
The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams
Come out
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

The days are okay
I watch the T.V. in the afternoon
If I get lonely
The sound of other voices
Other rooms are near to me
I'm not afraid
The operator
She tells the time
It's good for a laugh
And there's always radio
And for a dime I can talk to God
Dial-a-prayer
Are you there?
Do you care?
Are you there?
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold
Fix the heater, getting old
I am wiser now you know
And still as big a fool concerning you
I met your friend
She's very nice, what can I say?
It was an accident
I never dreamed we'd meet again this way
You're looking well
I'm not afraid, yeah
You have a lovely home
Just like a picture
No, I live alone
I found it easier
You must remember how I never liked the party life
Up all night
Lovely wife
You have a lovely wife
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold
Fix the heater, getting old
You are with her now I know
I'll live alone forever, not together, now
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold
Fix the heater, getting old
You are with her now I know
I'll live alone forever, not together,

I love to waltz with a man in a dark linen suit
All alone-at a party with someone I knew
From a time gone by turned into stone
You could be Garbo or even Marlene
You could be Marilyn...
Or you could forget
I play the part but then all of us do
And I do it so well as I do it to you
In this town full of strangers
In this town full of fools
Venus doesn't glitter when she stands next to you
When you're waltzing through stardom
You miss what you lose
Lose yourself in a silvery dress
For you think you must do what you feel you do best
And you mustn't give it up for you're still but a guest
You could be Garbo or even Marlene
Or you could forget

Doin' time in the passin' lane,
Bubba's got the hammer down,
About the time we get where we're goin',
Were rollin' out of town,
Our lives change with the weather,
And it's comin' down in sheets,
Don't get me wrong, we love what we're doin',
But it sure would be nice to be
[Chorus]
Back home in the country,
When a storm blows in,
Where it feels like heaven,
When that water his my skin,
We live in a downpour,
But it's just not the same,
Nothin' washes my soul clean,
Like that Carolina Rain
Sixteen hundred miles away,
Cruisin' thirty thousand feet,
Dog tired from last nights show,
Dozin' in the window seat,
I was dreamin' 'bout a beautiful woman,
I left her with tears in her eyes,
When I'm back in her sweet arms,
Then I'll know that I'm
Chorus]
Sweet water pourin',
Rain, I can feel it now,
Rain, Lord it takes me
[Chorus]

You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock
You're shuckin' and jivin'
Stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock crack rock crack rock
Crooked cop dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot
300 men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock
Crack rock
Crack rock
How you feeling girl
How's the gutter doing
Crack rock

[Chorus]
I know just what you need
Oh let me love you please
I want to show you my love
And when I start it up
Oh you won't get enough
I want to show you my love
Yes I'm seeing you
And what you're going through
You deserve something better
See what I see your doing
I've come to the conclusion
That we should be together
I really can't explain it
It's just a natural thing
For you to be apart of me
I want to show you somethin'
Know just what you're wantin'
Baby can't you see that I just want to
[Chorus]
Sometimes there is confusion
When you don't know how you really feel
But I have come to the conclusion
That what we have is real, oh
[Chorus: xx2]
Oh I want to show you
Want to show you,want to show you
Oh I want to show you
Want to show you,want to show you
Oh I want to show you
Want to show you,want to show you
Oh I want to show you
Want to show you,want to show you

They say our feelings could not be real
We know the deal yeah!

Cause girl I'm so crazy 'bout you
And I know it's not wrong
Because I want to be everything that you need

I want to be with you
You want to be with me
I want to be with you

Have you seen behind the screen
That severs life from art?
Or do you see the same as me
Completeness come apart?
And who am I to qualify
The contents of your heart?
It's a simple understanding
Of the way you hand it over
And hold on to it, too
With the lightness of a feather
It's the web that ties together
What is true
Make it happen
Make it happen
Create the night anew
It's a hymn to the grace
That's found a place in you
Could I look into a book
And find the answer there?
Or do the angels prearrange
An eye for what is rare?
And would the prize anaesthetise
The ache that makes me share?
It's a simple understanding
Of the way you hand it over
And hold on to it, too
With the lightness of a feather
It's the web that ties together
What is true
See the others flappin'
With their fingers snappin'
Tryin' to make it happen, too
It's a hymn to the grace
That's found a place in you

Well, my friends, I feel it's time
To reassess the situation and decide what's mine.
Every time you steal me blind,
With no consideration for the way I feel inside.
And you just look at me like you don't understand.
How could we... how could we let it get so out of hand?
Don't steal me blind.
You, my friends, would bleed me dry,
And with no hesitation you would pass me by.
And you keep telling me that you don't understand.
What's the use; there's no point in building on sand.
Don't steal me blind.
Well, my friends, I feel it's time.
There's a fortune in friendship.

Sweet ride
Give up, you won't survive
You'll never get out alive
This world won't let you
I bet you
And if it did
What's it gonna get you?
What counts is a-how you feel inside
Girls, love's the sweet ride, mmm
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet ride
You'd better hang loose
Don't come undone
It's better to walk than run
Each day is just something to glide on
And each night's made to slip and slide on
What counts is a-how you feel inside
Girls, love's the sweet ride
It's such a sweet, sweet ride
Yeah, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet ride
Sweet, it's such a sweet, sweet ride, yeah
Hang loose
Don't come undone
It's better to walk than run
Each day is just something to glide on
And each night's made to slip and a-slide on
What counts is a-how you feel inside
Girls, love's the sweet ride
Love's such a sweet, sweet ride
Mmm, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet , sweet, sweet ride
Sweet, such a sweet, sweet ride
Yeah, it's such a sweet, sweet ride
You'd better hang lose
You'll never survive
'Cause love is such a sweet, sweet ride
Sweet, such a sweet, sweet ride
Sweet

Only tell me that you still want me here
When you wander off out there
To those hills of dust and hard winds that blow
In that dry white ocean alone
Lost out in the desert
You are lost out in the desert
To stand with you in a ring of fire
I'll forget the days gone by
I'll protect your body and guard your soul
From mirages in your sight
Lost out in the desert
If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track
I'll be the moon that shines on your path
The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above
For snow to fall on the Sahara
If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts
I'll hold you up, and be your way out
And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above
For snow to fall on the Sahara
Just a wish and I will cover your shoulders
With veils of silk and gold
When the shadows come and darken your heart
Leaving you with regrets so cold
Lost out in the desert
If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track
I'll be the moon that shines on your path
The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above
For snow to fall on the Sahara
If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts
I'll hold you up, and be your way out
And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above
For snow to fall on the Sahara
For snow to fall on the Sahara
For snow to fall on the Sahara
For snow to fall on the Sahara

Go!
Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo, boo.
Back of boogaloo,
What d'yer think i'm gonna do?
I got a flash right from the start.
Wake up, meat head,
Don't pretend that you are dead,
Get yourself up off the cart.
Get yourself together now
And give me something tasty.
Ev'rything you try to do,
You know it sure sounds wasted.
Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo.
You think you're a groove,
Standing there in your wallpaper shoes
And your socks that match your eyes.
Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.
Get yourself together now
And give me something tasty.
Ev'rything you try to do,
You know it sure sounds wasted.
Back off boogaloo,
What d'yer think i'm gonna do?
I got a flash right from the start.
Back off boogaloo,

Back off boogaloo,

Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.
Back off boogaloo,
I said, back off boogaloo,
Come on, back off boogaloo, boo.

Everybody's doing a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learning your A-B-C
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips, now
Come on, baby
Jump up
Jump back
Well, now, I think you've got the knack
Wow, wow
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on, come on
Do the Loco-motion with me
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Move around the floor in a Loco-motion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
(Come one)
You gotta swing your hips, now
(Come one)
That's right (do the Loco-motion)
You're doing fine!

Jump back (do the Loco-motion)
You're looking good
(Come one, do the Loco-motion)
Hm-hm-hm, jump up
(Come one)
Jump back (do the Loco-motion)

I've seen that recipe
Lawmen and royalty
And nothing on earth can take that taste
And make it something sweet
I saw the news today
A broken everything with years to pay
And nobody else can save us now
And that's alright by me
'cause I say
We make love in the face of it all
Feel the freedom and the purity
And what we need is not security
Something more than a law
We walk at night in a blind wind
Through the streets where the rich ones lived
And what we want's beyond the will to win
Something more than a law
I feel the rain on me
I'm soaked in memory
And never will I betray that love
'Cause that's not love by me
I know prosperity
But he could never be a part of me
The snow and the stone
Feeling never at home
Well she's my poetry
'Cause I say
And when we're lonely
It's more than lonely
So we turn around to say something bigger than us
But then who do you blame when your love is gone?

They used to tell me
You got to choose a side
Now it's four years later
And they beg for advice
Don't trust the critic he's a cynic
Make the call for yourself
This is my ten-step course to not be like everyone else
I know it's not the easiest route
And I know
It leaves you overflowing with doubt
But if you want it you can have it
Hope it's all that you dreamt
Cause once you got it your gonna get it
You wont be leaving this
You can't trust everyone you meet
They won't amount to anything
Go tell them
Go tell them it's not as simple as you think
You can't trust everyone you meet
They never meant that much to me
Go tell them
Go tell them it's not as simple as you think
Clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
I said clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
You'll get what you deserve

If the waters cool
I might just swim
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
I'd drift away
In a sunken state
I'm busy lappin' it up
I might be here all day
With the tides and their little secrets
Whispering to me to sleep
Would you take away my weakness?
"drift on
Drift on"
If the waters cool
I might just swim
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
I'd drift away
In a sunken state
I'm busy lappin' it up
I might be here all day
With the ripples and their stories
Cooking up a storm.
Will you carry all my weakness?
"Drift on
Drift on" If the waters cool
I might just swiiiiiiiiimmm
I'd drift away in a sunken state
I'm busy lappin' it up
I might be here all day
With the under current lurking
Watching sideways from afar
Could you take away
My weakness
I'm not that strong?
You see I feel so heavy
Without you
And you say
"Drift on
Drift on
Drift on...
...drift on
Mmmm
Stay strong
Drift on"

Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again, with you
Sometimes I think about you
And I remember all the things we went through
And I realize that I need you
I'm fallin' so in love with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again, with you
Oh, it's funny how things change
Not long ago I thought my love for you would fade away
Your love gets sweeter everyday
So in love I want to stay
So, baby
Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
'Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart
Don't you know
And the feelin' is strong
And I can't let you go
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again, with you
Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
'Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart
Don't you know
And the feelin' is strong
And I can't let you go
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again, with you
It's all that you want and more
I just want to close the door
And share my love
And share my love
I just want to be with you
Show you that my love is true
What you don't see
Believe in me
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again, with you

Wishin' I was skinny
Wishin' that the whole world knew my name
Wishin' I was thrillin', that I would never be
To blame, wishin' I was kissin' a girl with lips
Smooth as pearl, wishin' I was pretty, wish that
I could twist the world round my finger, wishin'
I had money wishin' for the time to spend it all,
Wish that I could wrap the world round my finger,
But I would always love you, I guess that would
Never change.

I disagree with prisons, I disagree with war
I disagree with powers and all that they stand for
I disagree with violence it's survival having a say
I disagree with war because I know that's not the way
I disagree with class distinction, labels and names
I disagree with cold belief that binds you in chains
I disagree with law because it's Mother hypocrisy
Man cannot be caged, man is love and love is free
I disagree if you believe a mind can be controlled
I disagree if you believe a soul can be sold
I disagree with murder cos I know that that is wrong
I send peace out to my brother, brother help me to be
strong
I disagree that we can't live as one family
I disagree a rose should be born with no leaves
I disagree this world will end on 2000 years
Cos I know the Lord will come before the final fall of
tears

Once my life
Had no direction
I was lost as could be
I was caught in a world
Spinning around in misery
I needed a friend
You took me in and you touched my heart
With your song of love
You gave me a brand new start
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Just like you said
Angels singing
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me
Now I'm lost inside your love
I tasted just enough
To make me hunger for more of you
Now I'm hooked on your lovin'
And I don't wanna break loose
With my heart in my hand
I'm yours to command
I'll do what you say to
Just never let me go Lord
I'm so in love with you
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Just like you said
Angels singing
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me
Now I'm lost inside your love
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Just like you said
Angels singing
Joy bells ringing inside my head
Now there's beautiful music
Flowing all through me
Just like you said
Angels singing

Seven days has gone so fast,
I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.
But you're not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least by that I'd know that you're okay.
A guy like you ain't meant to go away, no no
Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame.
I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.
I saw a guy that looked like you,
I did not know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.
Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame
And if you see me coming.
Look away, look away.
And if your mind is made up.
Look away, look away.
And if your worry about me
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame.

You and I were finished
I was through with you
Splitting up forever
Seemed the thing to do
I said I can't stand you
With your honey touch
This time you were cheating me
One time too much
Just then I remembered
That a friend I knew
Told me one thing
I should never do
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night
Everything may look so different in the early morning light
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark
What you're getting into may be just a lark
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance
Sure there was this guy
Right next to me
Mine just for the asking
He said he would be
But to leave my man
Seemed to me all too strange
And I'd say that I'm glad
I didn't make the change
Now our life is almost
Like a Paradise
Let me pass on to you
This advice
Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night
You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right
But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool
When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool
Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell
Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well
Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight
Changing lovers in the middle of the night
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night
Everything may look so different in the early morning light
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark
What you're getting into may be just a lark
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance

I'm in love with everything that breaks the grip of caution
On our getting up and leaving for a bigger day, still some say
That all you need is money to be free from what is poor
Well that's the lie of looking up from somewhere down
Because the sun will show to testify that all the
Time between belongs to you and I, to be still on fire
And when the strongest words have all been used
And all the new ones sound confused, to be still on fire
Somewhere in the middle we could see through all the people
And be playing second fiddle and be feeling sore
Shown the door to chase out all the child in you
Is throwing out the baby for the chance to make it easy to be more
And the sun will show to testify that all the
Time between belongs to you and I, to be still on fire
And when the strongest words have all been used
And all the new ones sound confused, to be still on fire
When the sun will show to testify that all the
Time between belongs to you and I, to be still on fire
And when the strongest words have all been used
And all the new ones sound confused, to be still on fire
And the sun will show to testify that all the
Time between belongs to you and I, to be still on fire
And when the strongest words have all been used
And all the new ones sound confused, to be still on fire

Oh, oh
You make me believe
You are the one for me it seems
But now I find it's hard
The way you're treating me, it's mean
Cause time after time
I keep changing my mind
And I can't get myself over you
The moment you leave me,
The moment you're gone
I don't think that I
Could last another minute
But when we're together,
Something's so strong
I don't think
That we'll ever find a limit
What's going on (what's going on)
What's going on
Each time you're down,
I helped you on your feet but then
Just as soon as you're ready to,
You left me on my own again
Cause time after time
I keep changing my mind
And I can't get myself over you
The moment you leave me,
The moment you're gone
I don't think that I
Could last another minute
But when we're together,
Something's so strong
I don't think
That we'll ever find a limit
What's going on (what's going on)
What's going on
When you lie that you love me
And small promises you couldn't keep
How I tried to believe you
But my tears they just cut so deep
And I can't get myself over you
The moment you leave me,
The moment you're gone
I don't think that I
Could last another minute
But when we're together,
Something's so strong
I don't think
That we'll ever find a limit

An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances,
One too many dances down the narrow street of time.
Remember how we faced the world, like two tramps shining.
Please, don't let that magic ever end.
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.
That day the long and dusty road had us both crying,
We used up our last joke just to try to smile a again.
And only now I find I know what we were learning,
Though it's dark and you have traveled far.
Every long night gives you one bright shining star.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I can still show you who you are.

It's cold in the cave
I've been here for days
Frostbit Lipstick Frigid Shame
Could you remember the way we felt?
I'm freezing now but you used to make me melt
You told me one day you'd be at my side
And all of your love would drip into mine
All of my blood turned blue for you
None of my prayers are coming true

IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASY - Deveria Ter sido fcil
IN THE MORNING WHEN I GET UP
De manh quando me levanto
I SEE YOUR FACE IN MY COFFEE CUP
Vejo seu rosto na minha xcara de caf
LOOKING BACK AT ME, LOOKING BACK AT ME
Retribuindo o olhar, Retribuindo o olhar
ANOTHER MORNING IN ANOTHER DAY
Outra manh em um outro dia
STILL I'M FEELING THE SAME OLD WAY
Ainda me sentindo da mesma velha maneira
I'M STILL MISSING YOU, MISSING YOU
Estou ainda sentindo falta de voc, falta de voc
IT SHOULD BEEN EASY, IT SHOULD BEEN EASY
Deveria ter sido fcil, Deveria ter sido fcil
SHOULD BE IT ALSO EASY TO DO
Deveria tambm ser fcil fazer
BUT I'M STILL GETTING OVER YOU
Mas estou ainda tentando esquecer voc
I CAN SEE AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE
Eu posso ver um velho amigo
THEN I'LL SMILE IN THE SAME IN TIME
Ento ao sorrir no mesmo momento
I GET OVER YOU
Eu tento lhe esquecer
I'LL BE NEW IN THIS NEW
Me renovarei com o novo
I GET SOME HOW, SOME DAY I WILL
Eu consigo de alguma forma, algum dia consigo
I'LL FORGET YOU I KNOW, BUT STILL
Eu esquecerei voc eu sei, mas ainda
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME - Isso tomar algum tempo
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME - Isso tomar algum tempo
IT SHOULD BEEN EASY, IT SHOULD BEEN EASY
Deveria ser fcil, Deveria ser fcil
SHOULD BE IT ALSO EASY TO DO
Deveria tambm ser fcil fazer,
BUT I'M STILL GETTING OVER YOU
Mas estou ainda tentando esquecer voc
IT SHOULD BEEN EASY, IT SHOULD BEEN EASY
Deveria ser fcil, Deveria ser fcil
SHOULD BE IT ALSO EASY TO DO
Deveria tambm ser fcil fazer,
BUT I'M STILL GETTING OVER YOU
Mas estou ainda tentando esquecer voc

Out on the sea we'd be forgiven
Our bodies stopped the spirit leaving
Wouldn't you like to know how far you've got left to go
Somebody's child
Nobody made you
It's not what you stole its what they gave you
In or out you go
In your silence your soul
Would you rather go unwilling
The heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left
In hind of sight no peace of mind
Where you begin and I'm defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell in spite of me
In hind of sight no peace of mind
It begins and we'll be fine
Where shadows bend and suddenly
The world becomes
And swallows me in

Don't whisper love and dream of wedding bells
Don't do all the talking, let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself
So when you feel a little tatty and unhappy with your face
Let it breathe into us and put you back in place
Let it breathe, let it breathe
From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave
For it will, it will go
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass
'To the world's greatest mum
From the oldest swinger in town'
Let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself
Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk
When we're too tired to talk
And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off
Let it rot, let it rot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot
In a knot, in a knot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot
Hang them from a cleaver and say 'Look what we've got
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot'
'To the world's greatest mum
From the oldest swinger in town'

I'll need tonight to sit and think about this
Think what to do.
I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow.
Hollow sorrow's nothing new.
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
Until I believe in my soul.
Tonight I lost sight of all purpose
Despite all this trickery you told me was right.
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah you must be fucking joking.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.
I'll punish the body to believe in the soul, I will punish
my body, until I believe in my soul

A half full moon in Mexico City I think of you
And when I saw the Southern Cross I wished you had too
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you
Oh, I've been spending half the year in a plane going up and down
And you've been seeing other people from a nearby town
Been obsessing and getting depressed about us
Excess baggage and other stupid band stuff
I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you
When you said the veins in my left hand were shaped like a tree
Was that the very last time you really looked at me
I'm in training to become as cold as ice
I'm determined to protect my feelings to disguise
When I said I didn't love you I told a lie
Because there is no one above you though I try
Would you laugh at the time I spent calling your name
Over and over and over and over again
I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you
The trouble is I got me close to hating me
And when I wake up in the morning it's your face I see
Oh, you once made me feel less afraid
You've got me pouring myself over this page
I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
Ooh, I wish my heart was cold but it's warmer than before
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you
I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew
But it's as warm as saxophones and honey in the sun for you

We talk talk talk
Close but not the same
Putting back the pieces that remain
You said it would be easy
But I can feel the strain
Does everything mean nothing?
I'm back on the scales weighing it up cause
I don't want to be the same anymore
Got to find what I'm here for
But it's so hard to change when life gets in the way yeah
We crash crash crash
With nothing left to burn
We try to turn the tables
We have turned
Covering the cracks
Won't make them disappear
I've lost count of the times that we've been here
What's the way?
Name the price I must pay cause
I don't want to be the same anymore
Got to find what I'm here for
But it's so hard to change when life gets in the way
Yeah
Seems everyone around me has moved on
Where's the spark when the spark has gone?
It's so hard to change when life gets in the way
Tell me what it takes to get through
Is everyone better as two?
If life is what you choose
I choose to leave this all behind all behind
For you
I'd leave it all behind for you
I don't want to be the same anymore
Got to find what I'm here for
But it's so hard to change when life gets in the way
Oh oh
Seems everyone around me has moved on
Where's the spark when the spark has gone?
Oh it's so hard to change when life gets in the way
The way

Head to my lips

Love has gone as surely as it came
Leavin' me mistaken
Leavin' you no shame
But that's not all
A child will be forsaken
Thinkin' she was safe
And who will be to blame?
We gotta put away the heartache
You gotta quell your desire
We gotta sacrifice, we must not break
You gotta put out the fire.
Thrown in my dreams, my hopes an' expectations
Believe me, I don't wanna make a fuss
But I can't allow you these new found aspirations
This little girl needs both of us.
You' gotta put away the yearnin'
We gotta hide all the pain
You gotta sacrifice the burnin'
Well let me help you smile again.
Remember sunny days when we would laugh
An' we would play
Throwin' stones in the sea, makin' castles in the sand
An' all those rainy days when we would walk
And stay out late
An' she'd go splashing in the puddles
Got her stockings saturated
Comin' home tired in the dark
Pickin' up sticks
An' kicking at the leaves
Laughin' at those crazy women
She was smilin' at the men.
But love has gone as surely as it came
Leavin' me mistaken
Leavin' you no shame
If that's not enough
A child will be forsaken
Thinkin' she was safe
Now sharin' all the pain.
We gotta put away the heartache
You gotta quell your desire
We gotta sacrifice, we must not break
You gotta put out the fire.
You' gotta put away the yearnin'
We gotta hide all the pain
You gotta sacrifice the burnin'
Well let me help you smile again.

Lately in my life I'm
Finding it hard to be
Certain of feelings that I
Thought would always be
Playing the game was easy
Saying the things that pleased me
But through it all I can see
Your love has slipped away
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Set my soul and spirit free
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Let me be what I can be
Go, make it easy on myself
Lately in my life I'm
Finding I'm strong if I'm
Picture myself no longer
Underneath your spell
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Set my soul and spirit free
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Let me be what I can be
Go, and just leave me
Go, and make it easy on myself
I can't stand to see you
Couldn't bear to feel you
It's tearing my heart and soul in two
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Set my soul and spirit free
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Let me be what I can be
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Take this love away from me
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
Can't you see what I can see
Gotta, gotta say goodbye now
That with you I'll never be
So, take your love away from me
Go, and just leave me
Go, make it easy on myself

as I look into your eyes
and I tell you how I 've been
I still can't find the words to say
what I really feel within
I guess I'll keep pretending
that everything is fine
and act as if I'm over you
and that you never cross my mind
but if my heart beats wild when I'm close to you
will you see the spark in my eyes
before we say
our goodbye's
(chorus)
don't you hear the music that we dance to
since we missed our chance
share the moments that we plan to
can once dance do any harm
baby won't you hold me like you used to
forget I ever know you
if it happens that i lose you
this one dance will keep you close to my heart
I've missed you tender touch
I've dreamed of being here
but even sweetest dreams
you'd always dissapear
so I can't be sure what you're lookin' for
or expect forever again
when even tonight
has to end
(chorus)
memories, I tossed away
returned as good as new
so how can I just walk away
from one last dance with you
when even now... I'm still in love with you
I can't stop thinking we're meant to be
more than old friends meeting tonight
and the light in your eyes
says I'm right
(chorus)

Don't look at me
Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone left the puzzle undone
That's the way it is
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down
Don't you bring me down today
No matter what we do
(no matter what we do)
No matter what they say
(no matter what they say)
When the sun is shining through
Then the clouds won't stay
And everywhere we go
(everywhere we go)
The sun won't always shine
(sun won't always shine)
But tomorrow will find a way
All the other times
Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down
Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today

I'm leaving you
I'm not sure if that's what I should do
It hurts so bad
I'm wanting you but can't go back
Trying to find, find
That all elusive piece of mind
Stuck here somehow
I'm shrouded beneath my fear and doubt
And I don't need it
Cause I'm walkin' down this road alone
And figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you, is you my love
My head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for the droplets, droplets
You left a mark
I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best
When I'm with you
Everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret and I don't need it
Cause I'm walkin' down this road alone
And figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you, is you my love
And my head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting to fall and sink into your skin
You are like the raindrops, the raindrops falling down on me
So you left a mark (you left a mark)
She left a mark (he left)
She left (he left)
She left a mark
And I don't (I don't)
Need it. (Need it)

Her eyes are underneath the ground
I have heard the crying sound
No one can stop you now
No one can stop you now
Her eyes are basking in the sun
No one knows why she did the things she's done
Ocean, swallow me now
Ocean, swallow me now
In the garden with my mother
I stole a flower
With my mother, in her power
I stole a flower
I saw six eyes glistening in my womb
I felt you calling to me in the gloom
Rest assured your love is pure
Rest assured your love is pure
In the garden with my mother
I stole a flower
With my mother, in her power
I chose a flower

Lord, Your mercy came and it made me sing
With all my heart
Blessed be the name of the one who brings
Such a fresh new start
Ah, now the air smells clean
And the grass looks green, the sky looks bluer
Than I have ever seen
You have made my sweetest dream come true
And I want to live for You
For the rest of my life, for the rest of my life
And I want to give to You
All the rest of my life, all the rest of my life
Lord, You've proved again You're love extends
To the deepest need
When I hit the end You're love begins
And from there you lead
Lead through an open door
To a golden shore a royal kingdom
Where my heart explores
And the more I learn, the more I sing
And I want to live for You
For the rest of my life, for the rest of my life
And I want to give to You
All the rest of my life, all the rest of my life

Whatever you need baby
Baby you don't ever have to be afraid
Surrender to me for anything that you want
Cause you're my lady and you don't even need to go to work
Cause I got your act in so many ways
We'll spend some time
Relax a while and we won't think of no one else
I'll put you before myself
I'll never find another girl like you
Who can love me like you do
So I can give my love to you
Whatever you need baby (whatever you need baby)
To keep you satisfied
Whatever it takes to keep you smiling
Whatever you need baby
To keep you by my side
Whatever it takes to keep you smiling

I've got bad news baby
And you're the first to know
Yes, I've got bad news baby
And you're the first to know
Well, I discovered this morning
That my wig is about to blow
Well, I've been rocking on my feet
And I've been talking all out of my head
Yes, I've been rocking on my feet
And I've been talking all out of my head
And when I get through talking
I can't remember a thing I've said
Now, I used to be a sharpie
All dressed in the latest styles
But now I'm walking down Broadway
Wearing nothing but a smile
I see all kinds of little men
Although they're never there
I tried to push a subway train
And poured whiskey in my hair
I'm a gal who blew a fuse
I've got those blowtop blues
Last night I was five feet tall
Today I'm eight feet ten
Every time I fall downstairs
I float right up again
When someone turned the lights on me
It like to drove me blind
I woke up this morning in Bellevue
But I've left my mind behind
I'm a gal you can't excuse
'Cause I've got those blowtop blues
Well, I got high last night
And I took my man to his wife's front door
Yes, I got juiced last night
And I took my man to his wife's front door
Oh but she was a 45-packin' mama
And I ain't goin' to try that no more

I forgive your weakness
In light of all this bleakness
You were merely human
Destined to be ruined
Startled as your brevity
Turned to my longevity
I can't follow your steps
Can't go the places you went
I must forge my own path
Overcome and surpass
Startled as your brevity
Turned to my longevity
The more I see around me
The more it does to ground me
At peace with all my limits
Grateful for all I'm given
Startled as your brevity
Turned to my longevity

Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight
I drill you deep into my chest
That's where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
'cause I don't want to be alone
'cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing another song
Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes
With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue,
'Cause I don't want to be alone
'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song
Mary Jane,
I've been hoping alone
Mary Jane,
Since you came along
Mary Jane,
I'm almost home
Mary Jane,
Sing another song
'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song
'Cause everyday that I'm breathing, sweet Mary Jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song

It's a pleasure to be here
All it takes to love oneself
Just switch it off, put all cares aside
And don't deny it, life is quiet
What a charming
Pick yourself up off the shelf
'Cause who can tell, you're such a pretty sight
Beautiful, sensational
A hit in black and white
Before you know
You could be the queen of the nation
Queen of the nation
Before you know it
Life is flashing before you
Flashing before you
It's a pleasure to be here
And an honor to meet you
We only have one life
This is not a rehearsal
Blink and it's over
Life is a riot
We only have one life
This is not a rehearsal
Gentle believer
How deep is your faith?
Tomorrow may come
And sweep you away
There is no sense in suicide
To be a bomb, an Anglo-Russian spy
A great defector, love detector
Multi-racial
Gravitate and float on out
Be a kid, what else is there to be?
'Cause life's a riot, don't deny it
Technicolor dream
While we are walking
Through the rain and the thunder
Rain and the thunder
Before you know it
Life is flashing before you
Flashing before you
It's a pleasure to be here
And an honor to meet you
We only have one life
This is not a rehearsal
Blink and it's over
Life is a riot
We only have one life
This is not a rehearsal
It's a pleasure to be here
Gentle believer
How deep is your faith?
Tomorrow may come
And sweep you away

Coke machines on the ho chi minh trail
Russian spies shopping at bloomingdales
Killer bees swarming up the rio grande
Hey baby where'd you get that tan
Rome burns as we dance cheek to cheek
Titanic's sinking but oooh do we look chic
New york city's got the hong kong flu
And I can't take my eyes off you
Mx gi joe
Rsvp ufo
Abcia
I still want to know who shot jfk
Let's dance
To the rhythm of romance
Let's swing
'neath the stars above
C'mon let's dance
To the rhythm of romance
Let's kiss
Let's fall in love
Johnny woke up from his american dream
Rich man poor man and a desert in between
Crystal chandeliers hangin' by a thread
We're in the pink baby just two trillon in the red
And I hear gabriel blowing his saxophone
Through a great big hole in the ozone
Who cares it the sun don't rise
When I look in to your ultraviolet eyes
That's life, this is war
I took it on faith, can't take it anymore
Old, young, yin and yang
We'll all go together in the next big bang
Boom shug a lug a lug a boom
Let's dance
To the rhythm of romance
Let's swing
'neath the stars above
C'mon let's dance
To the rhythm of romance
Let's kiss
Let's fall in love

Ya!
Yeah...
Aay, shorty.
(Britney giggles)
You're so sweet
Britney:
Stranger, A stranger
Candy from a stranger
Excuse ma, but you're sick
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss
Come, be my desert in this
I put my spoon in your dip
Oooh!
We got one night only
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me
Then she told me;
Britney:
I don't even know you
But here, I got a snicker for you, here!
[Chorus:]
Britney:
What's in front of me?, I just can't believe
Oh, you're tempting me
(Oh oh 'cause you're so sweet)
It's been too long
Oh, it feels so wrong
Danger, Danger, candy from a stranger
You don't need to sugar coat it
I got it, and you know it
All of the pieces with it
(mama told me don't)
Take candy from strangers
Candy from strangers
Candy from a stranger
Shorty, have a bite
I will fill your appetite
I know your mom said not to
But, I'll change your life after tonight
Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it
And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't fight it
Come give it to me
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Britney:
A stranger
Laze:
Come get some
Britney:
A stranger
Laze:
Just like that
A stranger
Don't be scared, don't be scared
[Bridge x2]
Mama use to tell me
Don't take candy from a stranger
But girl, you look so sweet
You got me reaching with my fingers
She said don't take candy from a stranger,
candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger
[Chorus x2]

I see the stars in your eyes
Where our universe collides
Lay beside me
Feel my heart beat
Take me through the night
Standing there in front of me there's nothing I can say
Cause boy you really take my breath away
Ooh baby
No denying I'm in heaven when you look my way
And you can't hide it's written on your face
Take me far away it's where I want to be
Together for eternity
Eternity
(chorus)
I see the stars in your eyes
Where our universe collides
Lay beside me
Feel my heart beat
Take me through the night
So let our bodies move in time
The moon and stars are all in line
You're the one I've waited for
Don't have to search no more
Close your eyes
Drift away
Touch the stars
Golden rays shine through the haze and touch us where we lay
Destiny has handed me my fate
So lay your head up on my pillow and watch the angels play
Close your eyes and we can drift away
Lay your hands on me
Our bodies will entwine
I love you till the end of time
The end of time

Big bills
Cheap thrills
Style kills
You say you set your standards way too high
So you convincingly effect a compromise
Some unsuspecting body's gonna pay
When you discover that you can't always
Have your way
Big pain, big pills, style kills
If he won't you will style kills
You say your lover's got a lot of nerve
'Cause he won't keep you in the style that you deserve
You kid yourself you're only marking time
Till you fulfill the revenge in the back
Of your mind
Clear out, no frills, style kills
You never take the blame for your mistakes
Why should you give anyone an even break
If he won't - you will style kills

I'm the kind of guy a girl takes home to mom
Pleated khaki pants, and cologne that's the bomb
(you sure smell perty)
Shake her dads hand
Look him in the eye
And tell him Straight up im just a regular guy (ill have her home by 9 sir)
I'm a regular guy who stays out of trouble( let me get that for you mam)
A regular guy says mam on the double( I'm on it)
I'm a regular guy just like Dawson's Creek
A regular guy just don't call me a geek, a geek yeah
But sometimes I remember what got me here
It was Friday and cussing
Back off I'm in a boy band
And showing no fear
I watch Jay Leno (he's funny) 7th Heaven too
And I ask myself sometimes what would jesus do
Grab me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
I'm buds with my mom
And I hang out with my dad..he's my buddy
I play everything safe so I'll never be sad (boo hoo)
I'm a regular guy who stays out of trouble( let me get that for you mam)
A regular guy says mam on the double( I'm on it)
I'm a regular guy just like Dawson's Creek
A regular guy just don't call me a geek, a geek yeah
Don't push me.
Damn't sometimes I wanna smash things up
Jacked up and wrapped up I'm in a boy band.. a boyband
And have to pee in a cup
I'm a regular guy who stays out of trouble( let me get that for you mam)
A regular guy says mam on the double( I'm on it)
I'm a regular guy just like Dawson's Creek
A regular guy just don't call me a geek, a geek yeah

Warm all over, warm all over
Every time you smile, you get me warm all over
Sometimes I feel kind of odd in the cold
But when I touch your hand and I'm home
Home again and warm all over, warm all over
Gone are all the clouds that used to swarm all over
Please always let me keep feeling the way I do
So warm all over with a tender love for you
Please always let me keep feeling the way I do
So warm all over with a tender love for you

I can't touch you anymore,
I can't tell you how I feel,
As I fall, You would walk.
Heavy hearts do bury words
Under promises and "anything you wants," you'll have.
Like a body without warmth
Feels the blood arrest
And blackens from the cold, I'd cave
For kings and queens misunderstand
Heaven isn't held
But takes you by the hand, so I've found
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel
As I fall, You would walk.
Tame your thoughts and let me in
Break your callous ways and press me to your skin
Save a rose

Monkeys dressed in uniforms
Thinking they own the place
Threatening to break my face
Cryin 'cos they wont let me in
You cant win with these guys
I wanted just to see you
Wanted just to see you
Adieu Clo-Clo
Goodbye to you my brother
Adieu Clo-Clo
Goodbye to you my brother until the end
Swimming in electricity
Stand back now could you please
Come on theres nothing to see
Watching the black and white flickering
Foreign to these ears
Something always breaks you
Something always breaks you
Adieu Clo-Clo
Goodbye to you my brother
Adieu Clo-Clo
Goodbye to you my brother until the end

Today I woke up smiling
In a misty morning mood
Watched your face as you were sleeping
I felt sure you understood
Well, you know, you know how I love you so
More than ever now with each single day
And you know that I'll still be loving you
1000 years from today
Hey, got that deeper kind of feeling
That a younger me kept pushing aside
Let me be for you all that I'm longing to
Right by your side
Well, you know, you know how I love you so
More than ever now with each single day
And you know that I'll still be loving you
1000 years from today
Yes, you know a lifetime to be with you
Seems so little now yet so far away
But you know that I'll still be loving you
1000 years from today, yeah
All of my longing and all my belonging
All I can give you, all my life with you
Oh, well you know, you know how I love you so
More than ever now with each single day
And you know that I'll still be loving you
1000 years from today
Yes, you know a lifetime to be with you
Seems so little now yet so far away
Oh, but you know that I'll still be loving you
1000 years from today, yeah
Yes you know, yeah you know how I love you so
More than ever now with each single day
Oh, but you know that I'll still be loving you
1000 years from today

Cross her off your short list
My blood is a red winged bird
The way will be lit by the bridges we burn, oh
And come, tornado, carry my away from the croft
Ruffle my hair, bear my body aloft, oh
As the cutlass came down on a Saturday night
Left an unplanted field, left my daughter and wife
Called away into service for a clerical life
Left an unplanted field, left my daughter and wife
Thought I was a sad boy
Now I know, I know, I know I was wrong
Since you came alone I can see how content I had been
It'll drive a man crazy to age from the outside in
But I have a plan, it's a trick with the prick of a pin
As the cutlass came down on a Saturday night
Left an unplanted field, left my daughter and wife
Called away into service for a clerical life
Left an unplanted field, left my daughter and wife

Another heartache for me
Another thorn in my side
Another warning, another warning

Remember Russia (dying)
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Another stain on humanity
Another scar we can't heal
Another warning, another warning
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
And damn those satellites to hell
Another waste of brain
And now they've poisoned
They've poisoned our rain
Another warning, another warning
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
Remember Russia (children)
Remember Russia (dying)
And damn those satellites to hell
Remember Russia, remember Russia
Remember Russia, remember Russia
Remember Russia, remember Russia
Remember Russia

Grains of sand slip through your hands
Never ceasing time
Fold your hands in silent prayer
Eternal peace you'll find
[CHORUS]
Like two rivers flow
to the open sea
Someday we'll reunite
for all eternity
Let the rain falling on your face
Run in to your eyes
Can you see the rainbow now
Through the stormy skies
[CHORUS]
Like two rivers flow
to the open sea
Someday we'll reunite
for all eternity
Like two rivers flow
to the open sea
Someday we'll reunite
for all eternity
Standing in the rising tide
Heaven's light shines on you
On you, on you
Test the sea rising at your feet
How far can you go
Til you need God's helping hand
To ride the under-toe
[CHORUS]
Like two rivers flow
to the open sea
Someday we'll reunite
for all eternity
Someday we'll reunite
for all eternity
Someday we'll reunite
for all eternity

Her name was Suzy
Met her in a Ja'causezi
Nearly twice my age
She had a son my age
From sepultura
To Bali
I'm made of metal
I was born in a desert
And I haven't seen water for years
Her Kawasaki
Runs on saki
You can burn rubber but it takes a while
She took a quarter mile with a smile
You don't phone me
You don't answer my call
I don't want to lose you
For lollapalooza
You and me
On TV
I love you smile
Tribal war
We're not into that
Bbc
Mtv
National tabloid
National front line
Watch your business
Mind your business
Manimal
Understandable
I signed with Sony
You ride a pony
You wear stilettos
Check your history
I love to burn weed
Learn to love electro
Can't find no cooks on a Sunday
Gonna take some of this money
And open up my own chicken run
Ital is vital
Use your fork
You know Bjork
You know New York
Bathe in the dark
You can point out a shark
You test me
Talk to you manana
You are my familiar
Walk with you tomorrow
I don't know who's got a bigger trigger
But I don't think of myself as a PCP Lsd THC
Yes mister t come make a track with me
You don't phone me
You don't answer my call say
You'll embarrass me
And I just laughed at you

I will take your childhood dreams
And turn them into to beautiful film
I will take your most important things
Cast them gold fill a mueseum
So your heart doesn't know where mine's been
I'll never let your heart go where mine's been
I will kiss away every tear
They'll disappear in my mouth
And i will believe in all your fears
You let them in, i'll let them out
And put them in their place, my love
So your heart doesn't know where mine's been
I'll never let your heart go where mine's been

(diana ross/freddie gorman/janie bradford)
Go deep in circles
To find it in me
Rain falls around to my beginnings
So many riddles of my identity
I know all the answers of who I'm supposed to be
I am me
Good or bad
I am myself
I'm no carbon copy of no one else
Right or wrong
I will stand up like a tree
Happy or sad
Good or bad
I am me
I am me
Following a move
Set up by some others
I would lose myself
And become another
Should I fail
And come to my ruin
Or if I succeed
It would be, be my doing
I'm me
Good or bad
I am myself
I'm no carbon copy of no one else
Right or wrong
I will stand up like a tree
Happy or sad
Good or bad
I am me
I am me
Different images
So many people see
Not knowing themselves
They are unique
To copy may be flattery
I understand
I can be a better me
Than anyone else
I am me
Good or bad
I am myself
I'm no carbon copy of no one else
Right or wrong
I will stand up like a tree
Happy or sad
Good or bad
I am me
I am me
I am me

Baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
Since we've been together baby
It hasn't been too long
But I slowly feel myself
Falling love again
And I want to give you more of what I have inside
But if I open up to you
Baby you got to love me too
Everytime I think about the time we spend together baby
Holding hands and making love
Long walks and morning talks
I can't believe you only thought
We were friends
Boy you can't pretend
Baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
My baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
Take some time to listen boy
It's not so hard to do
Why can't you understand
After all that we've been through
If you cut away your pride
And search within yourself
I know you'll change your mind
Cause I'll be with someone else
Baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
My baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
Everytime I think about the time we spend together baby
Holding hands and making love
Long walks and morning talks
I can't believe you only thought
We were friends
Boy you can't pretend
If I didn't have you baby
I don't know what I'd do
Cause you make me happy and I'm
Giving you all my love
I never want to be without you
I don't know what I'd do
Cause you make me happy so boy
Don't be afraid of my love
Baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
My baby don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love

Give me your black lungs
And your blue eyes
And we'll trade them in for a new disguise
Give me your best bet
And your worst lie
And we'll fill them in with a straighter line
You could be everything I wanted
If you just gave up on holding back
And Ive never lost so many words
From kissing just one girl
Youve got potential
Wait for it
Wait for nights that compliment you
Ignore the girls that just resent you
Its easier to pretend you dont care at all
Now wait for it
Wait for boys that overwhelm you
And tell them that youre not that type of girl
And you would rather sit and talk about your goals
You give me black lungs
And your blue eyes
And we'll trade them in for a new disguise
Give me your best bet
And your worst lie
And we'll fill them in with a straighter line
You could be everything I wanted
If you just gave up on holding back
'Cause I never lost so many words
From kissing just one girl
Youve got potential
Wait for it
Wait for nights that decimate you
Wake up and then pray for saving
Hope has never seemed so far away from you
Now wait for it
Wait for years to pass you by
Youre looking back at all the times
You wish you hadnt compromised at all
Well I tried
Well I tried
Well I tried to make you see
That you lost reality somewhere
I tried
Give me your black lungs
And your blue eyes
And we'll trade them in for a new disguise
Give me your best bet
And your worst lie
And we'll fill them in with a straighter line
You could be everything I wanted
If you just gave up on holding back
And Ive never lost so many words
From kissing just one girl
Youve got potential

If this is kissing an angel
(Then I'd rather burn in hell)
Your lipgloss tastes like cherry
(Why does it burn like cyanide?)
I won't waste any time now
(Straight for the jugular)
Poison arrows for this heart now
(Love lost, love less)
So cut away all the ties we have
Cut the veins attached to my heart
Break away from love and sticky notes
I won't stay for one second more
Unspeakable my starlet, beauty's lost its sparkle
Love lost and love less
Love lost and love less
If this is love at first sight
(Then light my eyes ablaze)
Your tender touch, on my back now
(Pull out the knife you dug so deep)

For a little face, that's the biggest yawn
Look at teddy bear yawning too
All those animals sleeping in your bed
Do you really think there'll be room for you?
Time to tuck you in, warm and cozy-like
Are you comfortable little lamb?
Such a sleepy smile you must surely know
All the lovely things you'll be dreaming of
Swinging tree top high, sliding belly down
Eating jelly beans to your heart's delight
In a fairy tale in a wonderland through the night
[+]
I hope that she forgets and leaves my door open
So I can have a little light from the hallway
If I can hear them talking, if I can hear them laughing
I know I won't be frightened, maybe
At night I know that's just my chair, the nice red one
But it looks different than it looks in the daytime
Sometimes I think it's moving, a big enormous monster
A dinosaur or dragon maybe
I close my eyes and there are ghosts and witches
I'm scared a wicked witch will eat me
Oh, how I wish it wasn't always dark at night
For a little face, that's the biggest yawn [+] [sung in duet]
Look at teddy bear yawning too
All those animals sleeping in your bed
Do you really think there'll be room for you?
Time to tuck you in, warm and cozy-like
Are you comfortable little lamb?
Such a sleepy smile you must surely know
All the lovely things you'll be dreaming of
Swinging tree top high, sliding belly down
Eating jelly beans to your heart's delight
In a fairy tale in a wonderland through the night

Baby, someday you're gonna know
There's more to get than what you've got
You gotta learn to let go stop living it up, ready or not
'Cause you don't know what you want
But I can show you what you're missing
You say you've played around and then some
But you've never had it all
All in one woman before
The way that you want her to be
Look at me, I'll be everything you ever need
You want sexy baby, I got it
Undress me whenever you want it
Everybody needs somebody, I can be that woman
So take it easy, but take it, feel me
If you need someone to make you feel this good
I can be that woman
Time to act, make your move
You gotta react, honey, you've got nothing to lose
But the chains on your heart, the clothes on your back
And that didn't I make you get down?
And didn't I make you feel better?
Okay, we fooled around but you haven't had it all
All that we had was one time
A taste of the best you can find
Step inside
Feel me driving you out of your mind
You want sexy baby, I got it
Undress me whenever you want it
Everybody needs somebody, I can be that woman
Take it easy, but take it, feel me
If you need someone to make you feel this good
I can be that woman
I can be that woman, I can be that woman
Sexy, undress me
If you need someone to make you feel this good
I can be that woman
Taste me, feel me
If you need someone to make you feel this good
I can be that woman
You want sexy baby, I got it
Undress me whenever you want it
Everybody needs somebody, I can be that woman
Take it easy, but take it, feel me
If you need someone to make you feel this good
I can be that woman
I can be that woman, I can be that woman
I can be that woman, I can be that woman
I can be that woman, I can be that woman, yeah
I can be that woman, I can be that woman

Money don't make my world go round
I'm reaching out for the higher ground
To a warm and peaceful place
I can rest my weary face
Life's answers we're trying to find
Battling inside our minds
Where do I go from here?
Will all my friends be there?
[Chorus]
Cause we're living, we're living in a crazy maze
And we're fighting, we're fighting to rise above the haze
Light's at the end of the tunnel
Sometimes the journey's long
There are many theories
Who's right and who's wrong?
The pressure's on I have to choose
I've got nothing to lose
I close my eyes I take a chance
Now I dance a different dance.
What's the key to a happy life?
A healthy mind and lots of spice
Running barefoot through the trees
That's my idea of free
[Chorus]
I packed my bags, I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm gonna stay
I'm on a train bound destiny
I can set my spirit free.
[Chorus]

When I was young at heart, I never had much money
But I never let faith depart, I kept it right beside me
When I was only seventeen, I knew just what I wanted to be
On the stage, on the front page with the spotlight shining
The spotlight shining on me
Take a chance to be a hero, a chance to play in this game
A chance to be somebody who you're gonna recognize my name
A chance to be a hero, a shot at the big time
A chance to be somebody new, a chance to be a hero
Funny, how time can fly right through you fingers
When the parade passes by, you know it's too late then
When your lifelong fantasy floats underneath the door
Down the stairs, out on the street, it won't be coming back
It won't be coming back anymore
Take a chance to be a hero, a chance to play in this game
A chance to be somebody who you're gonna recognize my name
A chance to be a hero, a shot at the big time
A chance to be somebody new, a chance to be a hero
When your lifelong fantasy floats underneath the door
Down the stairs, out on the street, it won't be coming back
It won't be coming back anymore
Take a chance to be a hero, a chance to play in this game
A chance to be somebody who you're gonna recognize my name
A chance to be a hero, a shot at the big time
A chance to be somebody new, I only wanna be
Only wanna be, I wanna be a hero

You've listened to too many T-Rex LPs
For me to think I could tame you
You crave power, like women
The next most beautiful one on the block
Where the grass is greener,
The grass is greener
Then you betray for kicks
A stylish man, with all your words,
They get me everytime
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
Too sour to swallow
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
A pointless fetish for me
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
Too sour to swallow
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
A pointless fetish for me you are
And Angel's tears could not deter you
You crave lust, like wanting me
Weak, me, the devil, just kissed all the doubts again
(the grass is greener)
I damn you
(greener)
I hate you
(the grass is greener)
Yes, I do
(greener)
(the grass is greener)
I damn you
(greener)
I said "I hate you"
(the grass is greener)
With all your words, they get me everytime
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
Too sour to swallow
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
A pointless fetish for me
(repeat 3 times)
(oh, you are)
Oh, you are
Like bitter lemon,
Too sour to swallow
(oh, you are)
I hate you
Yes, I do
I said now "Damn you!"
(oh, you are)
I said "I hate you"
Yes, I do
(oh, you are)
Damn you
I hate you
Yes, I do,
Like bitter lemon
(oh, you are)
Damn you
I said "I hate you"
Yes, I do
(oh, you are)

The room's all set and the door bell is ringing
The first to arrive switch their dials to swinging
The lights are dim to match the conversation
Strangers grin that stoned expression
He looks so cool says a girl with a giggle
His handkerchief bulge slipping from the middle
Strokes his chin as his eyes refocus Tonight's victim smiles back
He's gettin' so excited
They're revving it up
He's getting so excited
Excited
The music's dark begins to get blacker
People start to move towards each other
Some hold back some peel off the layers
The atmosphere erupts with the drunken liberators
Walls flare up with animated shadows As dancers jump like emancipated jackals
It won't be long till the first couple's clich? She turns to him to say
"I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that!"
She's getting so excited
They're trashing it up
She's getting so excited
Excited
The smoke mist clears to reveal drunken Jimmy
Whose just turned up, seen his woman getting friendly
With a charmer boy in a second-hand leather
Lights go green there's gonna be danger With two great strides there's a push and scuffle
You can't make out through the naked muscle
A high pitched scream a broken bottle A ribbon of blood on the floor

If you need someone
to hold you
when you are afraid
I'll hold you
If you need someone
to make you
happy when you're sad
I'll try to
If you need someone
to tell you
everything
is gonna be all right
I can do that
I can do that
If you need someone
to make you
feel safer than safe
I'll try to
If you need someone
to comfort you
when tears fall down your face
I'll do what I can
If you need someone
to make you
feel any danger
is far away
I'll do what
I can
I can
If you need someone
to tell you
everything
is gonna be allright
I can do that
I can do that
I can

Spiritual love spiritual love spiritual love
That's what we want
Spiritual love spiritual love spiritual love
That's what we want
Spiritual love that's what we want
Spiritual love that's what we need
Spiritual love that's what we always wanted
Spiritual love spiritual love
And we're living in a waste land with a cancer
So deep rooted in the hearts of all men
Whatwe need is a little miracle
Well here is comes
Spiritual love ah the spiritual love
Spiritual love for the good of man
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love
Spiritual love for the spirit of the man
Spiritual love in this world full of politics
Spiritual love in a world full of leaders
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love
And he said I love you
And I said I love you too
To free the world it's an emotion away
To free the world you must free your mind
To free the world in an emotional way
To free the world from the blind leading the blind
Spiritual love ah spiritual love
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love
Spiritual love sing it loud for the spiritual love
Spiritual love that's what we want
To all my enemies
To the power crazed dictators
To all the far flung legionnaires
To all the empty cynics
To all the negative forces in the world
To the non-believers
To the corporation owners
To their guilt ridden sleepless nights
From the seven oceans (poetic license)
From the beautiful mountains
From the birds in the sky
From the animal kingdom

Music:reinhard falk, lyrics:david-ceal vanian
When I saw you with my eyes I was somehow paralysed.
But honestly I didn't know what to say.
You were standing with your friends watching me with confidence, but all I did was hiding away.
It's true when they say it's not easy to be in a love at first sight.
So there's only this one thing that I just can do, which is telling you straight what I'm feeling for you.
You are the one you are my star
I know for sure you're like the sun and I just want you by my side
Feeling like a fool of love, praying to the lord above to send me down some clever words to say
But suddenly you start to smile and it only took a little while.
You walked up to me and asked: "what's your name? "
It's true when they say it's not easy but sometimes they're simply not right.
So, there's only this one thing that I have to do, which is kissing you straight
So you're kissing me, too
You are the one
You are my star
I know for sure you're like the sun and I just want you by my side
( repeat chorus )
I just want you by my side, that is right.
So, you can shine on my dreams come true.

Hey, I think in love
I'm trippin' on you
Can't believe it
When you say
You're feeling your heart
And that it goes boom
Something's happened to you
I want to follow you baby
Tonight, tomorrow
[Chorus]
And everyday when I'm feeling like this
I know you're gonna be
Thinking about what you say and what you do to me
Cause when the light's down low
And we play it slow, whoa
And when you love me like this
That's all I really need
Thinking about what you say and what you do to me
Cause when the light's down low
Then you got me where I can't say no
Let's bump, bump
Come on and bump, bump, bump
Ooh bump, bump
Come on and bump, bump, bump
Brr, bump, bump
There's nobody, just you
Wherever you go
That's where I'll be
Cause your love, it reaches up
Just like a rainbow
Spread your colors all over me
I want to follow you baby
Tonight, tomorrow
[Chorus]
Let's bump, bump
(Thinking about what you say and what you do to me)
Come on and bump, bump, bump
Ooh bump, bump
(And when you love me like this)
Come on and bump, bump, bump
That's all I really need
Brr, bump, bump
If there ever was a question
No I know, I got the answer
You're not just another lover
You're the one I can't live without
[Chorus]
Let's bump, bump
[Chorus]

When you fall too hard
When you're bruised and scarred
Wherever you are
I'll find you
When you're weary and thin
And your heart's caved in
Whether near or far
I'll find you
Whenever you feel like you've got nothing
Baby remember something
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity
Whenever the world just don't make sense
And your head is in a mess
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity
When you're lost and scared
And there's no one there
Wherever you are
I'll find you
Stream and tears
When your eyes won't clear
Wherever you are
I'll find you
So whenever you feel like you've got nothing
Baby remember something
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity
Whenever the world just don't make sense
And your head is in a mess
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity
If your stars are falling
I'll put them back in your sky
Yea, I'll always be there
Whenever you feel like you've got nothing
Baby remember something
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity
Whenever the world just don't make sense
Your head is in a mess
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity
I'll always be
Your centre of gravity

Your hills and dales and flowery vales
That lie near the Moorlough Shore
Your vines that blow by Borden's grove
Will I ever see you more
Where the primrose glows
And the violet grows
Where the trout and salmon play
With my line and hook delight i took
To spend my youthful days
Last night I went to see my love
And to hear what she might say
To see if she'd take pity on me
Lest I might go away
She said, "I loved an Irish lad,
And he was my only joy,
and ever since I saw his face
I have loved that soldier boy"
Perhaps your soldier lad is lost
Sailing over the sea of Maine
Or perhaps he's gone with some other one
You may never see him again
Well if my Irish lad is lost,
He's the one I do adore,
And seven years I'll wait for him
By the banks of the Moorlough shore

I'm in Outland
Sex tension
She whispers things I need
Look in her heart
Slow motion
'I've been expecting you.'
I'm in Outland
I'll do anything.
I'm in Outland
Storm my heart
Tear me up if you like.
Come closer
Say nothing
I've got something for you.
I shape sound
I shape time
I'll shape your world for you.
I'm in Outland
I'll do anything.
I'm in Outland
Emotion
Dark whispers in my head.
Got the sex scream
On new film
I've got the friend I need.
Don't play safe
Don't play clean
Don't play if you can't lose.
I'm in Outland
I'll do anything.

Humpty-Dumpty got so drunk he thought that he could sing
Now every rag and glossy mag thinks he's the next big thing
Watch the floodgates swinging open
Now the heart of rock and roll is broken
Mary, Mary, only rarely have I heard such shit
But still the DJs give you three plays every nine minutes
Shall the truth be left unspoken
Now the heart of rock and roll is broken?
Jack and Jill popped every pill till every thrill was gone
They looked inside and could not find the will to carry on
My worst fears have re-awoken:
Now the heart of rock and roll is broken

On the surface not a ripple
Undercurrent wages war
Quiet in the sanctuary
Sin is crouching at my door, oh
How can I be so prone to wander
So prone to leave You so prone to die
And how can You be so full of mercy
You race to meet me and bring be back to life, oh
I wake to find my soul in fragments
Given to a thousand loves
But only one will have no rival
Hangs to heal me, spills His blood, oh
How can I be so prone to wander
So prone to leave You so prone to die
And how can You be so full of mercy
You race to meet me and bring be back to life, oh
Curse-reversing day of Jesus
When You finally seize my soul
Freedom from myself will be
The sweetest rest I've ever known, oh
How can I be so prone to wander
So prone to leave You so prone to die
And how can You be so full of mercy
You race to meet me and bring be back to life, oh
How can I be so prone to wander
So prone to leave You so prone to die
And how can You be so full of mercy
You race to meet me and bring be back to life, oh

I don't want to be what you want to be
I just want to be what's right for me
I don't want to see who you want to see
Because your friends are no good for me
You say that love's an open door
I see you walking out but I hear you taking more
Now you want to kick it cause you dropped on the floor
I don't want to go where you want to go
'Cause when you go you move too slow
I just want to see what I want to be
And now it seems that I want to be free
I'm hearing what you're saying
But I don't know what you're doing
And I need some things explaining
'Cause you're evil and you're using
This giving and mistaking
This reality that you're faking
Can't you justify the feeling
And the pain that you're making

Oh hey Marki, listen to this song, oh no
I don't know if it's right or wrong
It's not easy, to tell you my feelings
Oh hey Marki, when you're old enough, oh no
You'll see, this life is tough
It's not easy to tell you my feelings
Oh my time, my time will slip away
Can't hold it baby
And you're getting older every day
If you're crossing the river
If you're crossing this river, oh no
You're not a little boy oh anymore
Not a little boy
If you're crossing...
Oh hey Marki, it's not a lie, oh no
There were million tears I cried
It's not easy to tell you my feelings
Oh hey Marki, I was so alone
Without you there's no home
It's not easy to tell you my feelings
I was strong, but my heart it was so weak
Can't hold it baby
See you tonight oh in my sleep
If you're crossing...
If you're crossing...
No more

She's like a frostfern in my head
The lamplight burns my eyes and then she fades away
My pencil's frozen in my hand
And the letter I can't write, it seems to be a desert without end
I woke up late at night
She called me up then disappeared
And the echo of her voice filled the empty places in my dreams
With the silent tide
She fades away
Again
She fades away
She fades away again,
Don't go now, please stay
My senses are cruising through a void
As pale reflections play on the deserted road
I hear a humming of machines
A distant sound like thunder
Crawling through the cold
There's no escape, I know,
I run around in circles without end
And the more the memory grows
Dissolving from reality
With the silent tide
She fades away...
... don't make me cry
This time, I've got to learn
I know, she won't return

*Mike and Wanya talk in the beginning:*
Mike: Hey, what's wrong squirt?
Wanya: I don't know man. Sometimes around this time of year I just get depressed.
Mike: Man, this isn't the time of year to be depressed. It's the time to be happy and giving, man.
Wanya: You know, sometimes I think about things that are happening in the world today, things I didn't have. I just feel like crying.
Mike: We all feel that way sometimes. But, it'll be alright.
Wanya: I just, I just wonder why.
Every day at this time of year
I wonder time and time again
Why are kids suffering?
All of the tears 'cause being caught in the crossfire (Why?)
Somebody tell me why
As the joyous day comes along
The eldest feel there's something wrong
He's looking for Mom but she's not there
Kids are looking for reindeer in the air
[Chorus:]
She messed up again
Why?
My brother and my sister
They ain't got no toys
What am I supposed to do
When growing up for me wasn't joy?
It's gonna be a why Christmas
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a
A why Christmas
No one was there but Grandma and her friends
A time of heartache is setting in
There's nothing I can do
Just sit and feel pain run me through
I often wished they were never born
The thought of them not having no toys
Their little hearts were torn
I was young and I cried as well
I didn't have a job
But I prayed to the Lord that there'd be better days
Yes, he gave me a reason to live
He gave me a sign
But I still think to that day when
[Chorus]
Brother and my
Brother and my
Brother and my
Sister
(repeats a lot)
[Chorus ](repeats to fade out)

You're stuck in my head, stuck on my heart, stuck on my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you
Ooh
This is the part, you've got to say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, we're leaving tonight when everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you
Ooh
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Ooh
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you
Ooh
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Ooh
Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Hold on to me
I never want to let you go
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold, oh oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
(We could turn the world to gold)
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh my baby, take me to the feeling
(Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me (just run away with me)
Run away with me (away with me, yeah, yeah)
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me

Hey darling, I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singin'
La, la la la, la la la
'Til everyone is singin'
If you can wait 'til I get home (I get home)
Then I swear to you that we can make this last
(La la la)
If you can wait 'til I get home (I get home)
Then I swear come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
It might be for the best
And hey sweetie, but I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't wanna be leaving
Yeah, you want it but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singin'
La, la la la, la la la
'Til everyone is singin'
La, la la la, la la la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last
(La la la)
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
It might be for the best
You know you can't give me what I need
And even though you mean so much to me
I can wait through everything
Is this really happening?
I swear I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually
La, la la la, la la la
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la (If you can wait 'til I get home)
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la (Then I swear we can make this last)
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Now everybody's singin' la, la la la, la la la
Then I swear we can make this last
Now everybody's singin' la

Your touch
My skin quivers letting down my guard
Who knew giving in would ever be this hard
Cause I can't go on pretending you are nothing more
Than one night, heeeyyyy
Heart stops
Pretend not to see you and slowly walk away
Eyes lock
Crowds I won't push through, tell me and I'll stay
Cause I can't go on pretending you are nothing more
Than one night, heeeyyy
CHORUS
We just can't go right back to how it used to be
I see you look at me
You want it, I want it....ah haa hahahaha
Just look into my eyes and tell me what you see...
How 'bout another try....aaaaaayyyyyyyyy
Lips lock
Feels like the first time, two in one collide
Awestruck
Love only part time, terror is sublime
Cause I won't go on pretending that you are nothing more
Than one night, heeeyyy
CHORUS
We just can't go right back to how it used to be
I see you look at me
You want it, I want it....ah haa hahahaha
Just look into my eyes and tell me what you see...
How 'bout another try....aaaaaayyyyyyyyy
BRIDGE
Oh oh oh, oh, oh oooohhh, oh oh
Hey ey, heeyy ey, ayyyyyyyyyy
CHORUS
We just can't go right back to how it used to be
I see you look at me
You want it, I want it....ah haa hahahaha
Just look into my eyes and tell me what you see...
How 'bout another try....aaaaaayyyyyyyyy ah haaa hahahahaha

There ain't nothing like 'em first loves baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights come n' dances
Givin' my old letterman's jacket away
To hold us a name
But now it's you and me talking on the phone til 4 AM
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed
Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
Girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she ain't got nothin' on you tonight
'Cause you're like the summer lovin' don't come or go
Never had to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like a first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine
Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Lookin back I wish I could put you inside every memory (every memory)
You can be my first love
My first kiss
My first and last everything
Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
And climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get your butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Yeah just like we're 17 again
17 Again, Oh

I couldn't feel the wind blow
Or see the rain fall
I couldn't smell the flowers
Hear the oceans roar
I couldn't sing a love song
Or say a word
I never had imagined
The mountains I could climb
Until I found you
Baby I believe
That I did the best I could
There was nothing to me
I was all that I could be
Then you came to me
And you showed me how to love
Didn't know love was true
Until I found you
And now I dream of places
That we can go to
I can feel the fire
Burning deep inside
And even in the darkness
I can fell you with me
I know that you will always be right by my side.
I couldn't sing a love song
Or say a word
I'd never had imagined
The mountains I could climb
Baby I believe
That I did the best I could
There was nothing to me
I was all that I could be
Then you came to me
And you showed me how to love
Didn't know love was true
Until I found you
Every day
Was harder than the others
There was times when I
Kept running for covers
Then you came to me
Showed me love forever
And you made me see
That I'm in love
Baby I believe
Baby I believe
That I did the best I could
There was nothing to me
I was all that I could be
Then you came to me
And you showed me how to love
Didn't know that love was true
Until I found you

You are a thunderous thing, wondrous king
The face of rival-less gods, deep in your thoughts
Come here, oh, closer to touch, never enough
Let me climb under your skin, oh let me in
From your lips a precipice
I hang from every word
Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
The calm of turbulent seas, fallen to sleep
And when the troubles arise, we hold on tight
How can a body contain something so great
My shell may suddenly burst out will come birds
From your, lips a precipice
I hang on every word
Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way
And we are high and seeking,
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
And we are high and seeking,
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
And we are high and seeking,
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high

Old Red eyes is back
Red from the night before the night before
Walked into the wrong bar walked into a door
Old Red's in town
And sitting late at night he doesn't make a sound
Just adding to the wrinkles on his deathly frown
They're only red from all the tears that I should've shed
They're only red from all the women that I could've wed
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
Listen up Old Red
You never listened to a word the doctor said
He told you if you drank another you'd be dead
Old Red Eyes is back
His shoulders ache all over and his brain is sore
He pours a drink and listens to his body thaw
They're only red from all the thoughts unused inside my head
They're only red from all the things I could have done instead
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
Blue is a street without an end
Red is the color of my hell
Blue is a greeting from a friend
Red is the color of farewell
Old Red he died
And every single landlord in the district cried
An empty bottle of whiskey laying by his side
A lazy little tear running from each eye
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue
They could never be blue

if I knew what i wanted
I would go and get it right away
but I am in the game again
remembering my name again
hope destroyed
heart is annoyd
feel the void
brand new dress
for excess
look your best
I go on and on and on
I can't stop my heart from beating
I go on and on and on
always chasing what I'm needing

He had a ticket
But
What
Was
Weird
They found it in his ear
She gave a fortune to those in need
But her heart was saved for me
Monday is my birthday, Tuesday is her birthday
Blue balloon for you, red balloon for her
Outside the sky is filled with rain
And I'm glad to be home again, oh yeah?
The sky was bullfrog green
Man you would have been amazed
The rain beat up the fields
My mind turned from less fortunate days

I've got three children to think about first
I've got so much to do
Little time to work
I've paid my dues as you can see
Been in all kinds of drama in my life series
The world needs to know that I
Gotta move on, gotta be strong
Can't let no one get me down, oh no
Problems they come, problems they go
Can't let no one get me down, oh no
What I'm thinking of
Life's not that important if you don't have love
Striving for perfection every day
I must make it better than it was the day before
Never will I be a fool and take my blessings for granted
I know God's been by my side
And everything's gonna be all right
Gotta move on, gotta be strong
Can't let no one get me down, oh no
Problems they come, problems they go
Can't let no one get me down, oh no
What I'm thinking of
Life's not that important if you don't have love
Striving for perfection every day
I must make it better than it was the day before
Even though you may have to cry
(Dry your eyes)
It will be all right
(Just put your faith)
Put your faith in the one who makes you strong
The one who makes you strong
What I'm thinking of
Life's not that important if you don't have love
Striving for perfection every day
I must make it better than it was the day before
Life will pass you by in the twinkling of an eye
If you didn't, now you know
You can't keep wasting time
We're getting older every day
There's more to life than just today
Our future's not that far away
You can't keep wasting time
Life will pass you by in the twinkling of an eye
If you didn't, now you know
You can't keep wasting time
We're getting older every day
There's more to life than just today
Our future's not that far away
You can't keep wasting time

What if we could go back?
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear
You come to me in dreams at night (come to me in dreams at night)
I wake up and I see the light
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone?
When I needed someone?
When I needed you, hey?
When I needed you, hey?
Once upon a time I
Thought you were the hero
I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kissed me like a sunrise
I feel it through my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
I'm not myself
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone?
When I needed someone?
When I needed you, hey?
When I needed you, hey?
You come to me in dreams at night
You come to me in dreams at night
I don't want to work it out
I'm not goin' to work it out
I don't want to work it out
No I'm not going to still
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone?
When I needed someone?
When I needed
When I needed
When I needed you?
When I needed you?
When I needed you?

Pink and blue were dancing
Empty floor, shadows lancing
Red and blue combination
Old man finds elation
Love me see what I see tonight
Let us find elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight

Blood pressure's rising
Can't catch my breath
Every time I hear footsteps coming nearer
These strange vibrations
I can't resist
The feeling scares me so
I lose control
My head is shaking
And my knees are weak
I feel the ground moving under me
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
This strong sensation
Is burning in me
Every time I hear you whisper in my ear
Got to have hold of my heart
Like gravity, I can't try to hide it
No way to fight it
My hands are shaking
And my knees are weak
I feel the ground moving under me
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending me,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
Heaven knows I tried
To keep my sanity
But mama never told me
What a man like you could do to me
Hey, shockwaves
Hey, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves

There's so much going on
You can think of me
When your hope is gone
You can think of me
To get through anything
You can think of me
I'm here as long as you need me
When nothing seems to work
You can think of me
Your heart is on a search
Let it come to me
I'll make it all reverse
When you think of me
Baby you can see new life through me
[Chorus]
Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that I'll make everything ok
Think of me baby in any way
I'll be all you need
Let me be the one you turn to when there's pain
Baby I will take it all away
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place
'Cause it's all in me
When it seems no one loves
You can count on me
When pain is all too much
You can count on me
Need someone to trust
You can count on me
I'm here as long as you need me
When you see brighter days
Know that it was me
Tears are wiped away
Don't guess it, it was me
When you realize your pain
Was suffered too by me
Then you know the love in me
[Chorus]
2-Step
Anything you could ever need
Baby I promise you can find in me
Don't matter if it's a hope or dream
I promise I'll make it a reality
Never really do much for you
Anything that's possible, I will do
Make it all so clear to you
Me loving you is more than true
Anything you could ever need
Baby I promise you can find in me
Don't matter if it's a hope or dream
I promise I'll make it a reality
Never really do much for you
Anything that's possible, I will do
Make it all so clear to you
Me loving you is more than true
Everyday, every night
Break of dawn
Air of night
Come to me
I'll make it right
If you let me
It's all in me
Everyday, every night
Break of dawn
Air of night
Come to me
I'll make it right
If you let me
It's all in me
[Chorus]

Let's take a map of the world
Tear it into pieces
All of the boys and the girls
Will see how easy it is
[Chorus]
To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom, and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse
All that we need at the start's
Universal revolution (that's all)
And if we trust in our hearts
We'll find the solution's
[Chorus]
Took a plane across the world
Got in a car
And when I reached my destination
I hadn't gone far
Let's take the whole of the world
The mountains and the sand
Let all the boys and the girls
Shape it in their hands
[Chorus]

I've been dreaming over
I've been dreaming over half the lies
You've been looking at me
You've been looking at me eye to eye
Take it easy
Lift your feet up off the burning ground
You don't see it
You get so high up 'cause you don't look down
She wants to hold you in her arms
She wants to tear you away from my heart
Does she light up like a lantern to show you the way through the dark?
Does she give you what you're missing? It's more than enough where we are
In her arms
In her arms
In her arms
In her arms
You believe in me
You believe in me alone tonight
But in my empire
I am king and I own the sky
Are you sleeping?
Now the bed you made is burning down
Keep breathing
All the birds you caged are breaking out
She wants to hold you in her arms
She wants to tear you away from my heart
Does she light up like a lantern to show you the way through the dark?
Does she give you what you're missing? It's more than enough where we are
In her arms
In her arms
Let there be smoke in my eye
Stop slipping there
I see her arms open wide
I stop slipping then
She wants to hold you in her arms
She wants to tear you away from my heart
Does she light up like a lantern to show you the way through the dark?
Does she give you what you're missing? It's more than enough where we are
In her arms
In her arms

Love reaction

If love is what you seek you can come to me for - love reaction.
Everynow and then you will need a friend for - love reaction.
It's the right time for love reaction.
It's the right time for love reaction.

Well, if you're in from the start
Then we're in this together
If you're not then I'll have to take on this world
'Cause this world can't take on me
I won't let go
I feel so lost without it
Crawl down my throat
I just can't think about it now
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And if you drop the bomb
Then I'll pick it up
I'm afraid to be
I stick it out but my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give, burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world
If the timing is right
Then I'll turn back the clock
And as the minutes count down
I'll put my trust in this world
'Cause this world can't trust in me
I'm holding on
I just can't believe that
All hope is gone
I'm such a wreck without it now
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And you bring the heart
Then I'll bring the beat
I'm afraid to be
I stick it out by my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give, burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world
I have to take on this world
'Cause this world can't take on me
I'm holding on
And as the minutes count down
I'll put my trust in this world
'Cause this world can't trust in me
I won't let go
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And if you drop the bomb
Then I'll pick it up
If it's your turn to live
Then it's my turn to give it up
And if you bring the heart
Then I'll bring the beat
I'm afraid to be
I stick it out by my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give, burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world
I'm afraid to be
I stick it out but my heart can't hack it
Just an example of inconsistency
I feel like I'm jaded
I've given it all I have to give, burnt out, frustrated
I feel like I'm an enemy of the world

I knew I shouldn't have left the apartment
I knew I should've stayed in watching TV
If I'd looked at the moon and looked at my stars
I wouldn't be in this mess I'm in right now
I should've known when my car would not get started
It should've clicked when indecision read its question mark
If I'd ran back for the phone but instead I let it ring
I wouldn't be in this mess I'm in right now
Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurt
I could've left all my cash and talent a credit card
I should've said, "Don't wear no jewelery you're looking fine"
If I'd ran back for the phone but instead I let it ring
I wouldn't be in this miss I'm in right now
Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurt
Please don't take all of my money mister
Don't take my money all money, money
Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurt

Two steps forward, and three steps back
And I don't know where we are
You see it your way, and I see it mine
And we're lost here in the dark
Not just a matter of talking it out
(You know) it don't mean nothing if there's something to hide
And oh, I know you know just what I'm talking about
There's an unspoken hesitation we both feel inside
Am I here, am I gone
Tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
Am I wrong, am I right
Are we saying good-bye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause all that I need is a reason
It's complicated, so overrated to say all we need is love
My baby believe me, I wish it was that easy
But sometimes love just isn't enough
This indecision here is wearing me down
I can't hold onto something so undefined
And I, I've got to know if what was lost can be found
This situation's got me crazy, goin' out of my mind
Am I here, am I gone
Tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
Am I wrong, am I right
Are we saying good-bye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause all that I need is a reason
And, oh, if you would only just let your feelings flow
I'd be the one who would never let you go, and you'd know and I'd know
All that I need, all that I need from you, all I need, all that I need..
Yeah, tell me where I belong
You know all that I need is a reason
Am I wrong, am I right
Are we saying good-bye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause all that I need, all I really need is a reason
Show me where I belong
All that I need, am I wrong, or am I right, are we saying good-bye
Give me something, wohhh
'Cause all that I need is a reason

Go away, never return
Lovers play, while some of us burn
It's high time to release your mind
When can you come join the festival fun?
Dream three days, make your mistakes
Soon one day awake will seem fake
But the time is now to never ask how
When will you come join the festival fun?

Have you seen the old man in the closed down market
Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride,
And held loosely at his side
Yesterday's papers telling yesterday's news
CHORUS:
So how can you tell me you're lonely?
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind
In the all night cafe, at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there all alone
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea cup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone
CHORUS
Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London
Dirt on her face, and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags
CHORUS

She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5.01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I'm way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again
And we're both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you
When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula I
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again
And we're still so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

If I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd help you, yes I would
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd be there if I could.
Well those in the know would have you believe
That the jackdaw is bad an' he steals
He's a symbol of darkness, a crow, the devil's own
An' the poet Laureate don't like 'em
An' Alfred Hitchcock didn't like 'em
An' it's a pretty safe bet that you don't like 'em
Well let me tell you something, I love 'em.
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd help you, yes I would
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd be there if I could.
But those in the know they'll scoff an' they'll say
If you were a sparrow or a robin you'd despise jackdaws
They steal your eggs an' eat your babies
Well I've thought about this an' I'll tell you
There might be a few rogue jackdaws
But they get their comeuppance, most care
If one in the flock gets left behind or set upon
Others return to help and secure its safety and well-being
An' I'll tell you something, I love 'em.
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd help you, yes I would
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd be there if I could.
An' I'll tell you something else what a jackdaw told me
"Your pecking order's all wrong", he said
"You're burning your book and soon you'll be no better
Than the fish in the sea
Listen to me".
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd help you, yes I would
An' if I was a born again jackdaw
You know I'd be there and I would.

Deep in the valley of our soul
Tired of worries you can't control
With so many mountains left to climb
Unanswered questions left to find
We go on
We go on
It's the first lesson learned when you're born
On the wings of angels
We ride out the storm
You and me
We go on
Pull a stranger from the water
And in that moment he's your brother
There's a gift when you receive him
Love is the greatest reason
We go on
We go on
It's the first lesson learned when you're born
On the wings of angels
We ride out the storm
You and me
We go on
Faith happens when you can't see
Against all odds you believe
We go on
We go on
It's the first lesson learned when you're born
On the wings of angels
We ride out the storm
You and me
We go on

You know, you never change your ways
And I don't mean the way you brush your hair
You know, you never change your ways
And I don't mean the clothes you wear
And I don't want you to lose your inhibitions
Just be a bit more flexible
By dictionary definition
Be a bit more ductile like me
You know, you never change your ways
And I don't mean the life you lead
You know, you never change your ways
And I don't know what you need
And I don't want you to lose your inhibitions
Just be a bit more flexible
By dictionary definition
Be a bit more ductile like me

As I write this letter
I hope you're feelin' better
Than I am as I sit here
Fightin' back a tear
'Cause my mind keeps shiftin'
Back in time it's driftin'
To the days when you were near
'Cause those were greener days
That we knew
Just me and you
Sharin' the world together
But as they came
They went away
Our days of green turned into grey
So I watched the sunrise
Hopin' maybe your eyes
Will come shinin' down on me
To brighten up my world
Like it once was glowin'
When your face was showin'
Me the way to find our love
Those were greener days
That we had
It's kinda to bad
They couldn't last forever
But we'll go on
Our separate ways
'Cause our greener days
Has turned into grey
I better close and sign my name
It's gettin' late
But don't forget our chance
To twist the hands of fate
So the greener days
Will return deeper they'll grow
With every spring rain of love
Rainbows will shine
You will be mine
And our greener days
Will never fade away
Yes, the greener days
Will return deeper they'll grow
With every spring rain of love
Rainbows will shine
You will be mine
And our days of green
Will never fade away
They'll never turn to grey
They'll never fade away

When all the rain is pouring down
And there is no one else around
Don't believe that I would ever share my world with anyone
But you
If there is water leaking in
And all the cracks are wearing thin
Don't believe that I would ever share my world with anyone
But you
And if they don't hear the door
Just knock louder
And if they still don't
We'll scream at the top of our lungs
We'll scream at the top of our lungs
I will never share my world with anyone
But you
But you
If you should be first to pass on
Even if I am still quite young
Don't believe that I will ever give my heart to anyone
But you
Sometimes a moment comes along
You've heard about it in a song
Don't believe that I will ever give my heart to anyone
But you
And if they don't hear the door
Just knock louder
If they still don't
We'll scream at the top of our lungs
We'll scream at the top of our lungs
I will never give my heart to anyone
But you
But you
I will never share my world with anyone
But you

Lover don't love too much
It's a bad thing, a sad thing
It is heaven to the touch
Hey everybody's got a moment in their lives
They can't change
(don't they baby)
I know you don't care
What's right or wrong
All that I know
Is that love don't belong heer
So it's better to turn the page
Watch me walk away my dear
Watch me walk away
You say
[Chorus]
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you
I want you baby
More than ever
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you
But it's never gonna be that easy
I don't want to waste your time
Lover don't love too much
I'm a bad boy, a sad boy
And I'll never give you much
Hey everybody's got some moment in their lives
They can't change
Yeah
So I do not dare
Take you home
All that I know
Is that something's so wrong with this heat
Why do you touch the flame
You know you feal the pain my dear
You always find it here
You say
[Chorus]
But it's never gonna
So what happens everytime
It's so easy to forget myself where
A little while you want a boy
In a place you will be all mine
Can't you see
Oh, I'm losing you baby
Chorus
But it's never gonna be that easy
You want a lover, I am just a friend

First, He's inched her latch down
Anxious, Her hand begs, And now my distraction
Distraction
I will learn, To focus on
Oh, you hoo hoo..., Cause you won't
Recognize it, Stablize it
Things take- take me
To exception look for respect
Respect
Down- down there
You're not a nice track footfall
Round
Will we still hold, Rain
Things we couldn't do
Strive, For me to leave
Rights of her, Rights
Treasure her, Treasure
Her freshness
First
He's inched her latch down
Anxious
Oh, her hand begs
And my distraction
Distraction
I will learn to, I will learn
Focus on you, To focus on
You hoo hoo..., Cause you won't
Recognize it, Recognize
Stablize it, Stablize it
He even finds a way
Supreme, man improves
Lkie what might see
Her life for everyone
Will it still hold
Rain
Things we couldn't do
Strive
For me to give
Rights of her
Rights
Treasure her
Treasure
Her freshness
I will learn
To focus on you
You hoo hoo...
Cause you won't
(fade out)

You look kinda like Jesus
In those Italian paintings
You seem so familiar - maybe that's why
You're accustomed to sorrow
It's part of your make-up
You speak the language of hunger
So do I
Where was your God?
Where was your mother?
Where is the honor in hurting a child?
Your blood on his hands
A voice like thunder
You won't give him the pleasure of seeing you cry
(chorus)
Alabama boy inside a man
Living your life the best that you can
With a childhood full of not enough
You could've chose hate but you chose love
When you're in the room
It's there on your face
So clear to me that you're walking in Grace
I'm always amazed at the things that you do
You illuminate me
And those around you
And I don't even know you
But I've know you forever
We were forged by some holy fire
Far away eyes
Filled with sadness and joy
Contradiction, benediction, Alabama boy
There's a raft on the river
It's sacred water
Sparkling beneath a southern sky
Little Boy Blue
Part Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer
Floating away with a dream in your eye

Love will always find you
No matter where you hide
Love is gonna find you
And it's only just a matter of time
Love's our common hero
It always gets its man
Cause love is so much stronger
Don't you know it will win in the end
Love will always find you
Love will always find you
No matter where you are
Love is gonna reach you
Cause it's never really that far
No, no man is a island
We weren't born to be alone
Life is made for sharing
And love is gonna find you home
I spent my time waiting
I lost my faith in love
Just as i was hurting
Well then you just turned up
So never give up hoping
You can't see you around the bend
Well you be sure of one thing
Love's waiting at the end
Love will always find you
No matter where you hide, yeah now
Love is gonna find you
It's only just a matter of time
Love's our common hero
It always gets its man
Love is so much stronger
Don't you know it will win in the end
Love will always find you
No matter where you hide, oh yeah
Love is gonna find you
It's only just a matter of time
Love's our common hero
It always gets its man
Love is so much stronger
It's only just a matter of time

Said you wanted space, you wrote it in a letter
Left a bitter taste fora while
How could you waste all the love we made and
Throw it in my face, with a satisfying smile
'Cause yeah, I know we fought, but still I thought
Once said, words were over and once over you forgot
They'd make us strong, what went wrong?
I hope you change your mind if you want me back
I'm sleeping in the same sheets, haven't changed a thing
Since you left me alone, do you want me back?
'Cause I can't stand the suspense all at my hearts expense
Am I wasting my time, tiptoeing around you
Watching my words, fall down at your feet
The truth is without you I'm incomplete
I dream that we're tied together when I'm asleep
Wake up, you're gone, what went wrong?
I hope you change your mind if you want me back
I'm sleeping in the same sheets , haven't changed a thing
Since you left me alone, do you want me back?
'Cause I can't stand the suspense all at my hearts expense
I hope you change your mind if you want me back
I'm sleeping in the same sheets , haven't changed a thing
Since you left me alone, do you want me back?
'Cause I can't stand the suspense (all at my hearts expense)
I hope you change your mind if you want me back
The pictures in the same place, looking at the same face
Since your gone, do you want me back?
'Cause I can't stand the suspense all at my hearts expense

Every little thing you do
Makes me feel a little love for you
And every little thing you say
Makes me say, oh baby we should float away
I could never calculate
Everything out on a plate
'Cause every little thing you say
Makes me feel like I can't wait
What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What would you say? What would you do?
If everyday I was here all over you
Would it be nice boy if you knew
What it be like with my eyes all over you?
What would you say if I could prove
That I could light every light inside of you?
What would you say? What would you do?
I wanna do it too
What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
Baby, come on over
Why don't you come on over, know you should?
I got a little for you
I got a little taste of what tastes good
Baby, come on over
Why don't you come on over, know you should?
I got a little for you
I got a little taste of what tastes good
What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe

Take your chance
Bring your life up to the top
And you never ever stop
And you try to do it right
You better take your chance
And luck will always be around
Keep your feet down on the ground
And you will never be alone
Come on come on take your chance
Your life is very hard
No time for romance
You know that life is hard
But you know that you'll make it
There is only one chance in life
And you better take it
You got some hard time
You got some bad time
You got some ruff time and you got some sad times
Listen to the word from the man smooth t.
We all get bizzy with da fun factory
Once you're the winner
But then you lose the game
Don't try to hide your sadness
'Cause we all feel the same
Praying to God and I hope he's going to save me
'Cause when he's around
I feel a special kind of safety
Take it take it just don't fake it
Put me in the spot and i won't fake it
Take your chance
Common take your chance
Ringidingiding ringidingidingdong
Me feel so sad ya'll
Me feel so sad ya'll
Can't control the beat of my heart ya'll
Me felt so sad when i left my family
Broken heart sad eyes low mentality
You better watch me
You better watch me
When I come to you
Nobody can stop me
Listen to the words from the man Smooth T
We all get busy with da Fun Factory
Take a look over troubled waters
Think about today what's up for tomorrow
What you really want is a chance to be free
How you're livin' what's about 'g'
Take a look in a looking glass
In a life class
Just watch me blass
That microphone is right straight to your heart

Wake up to the sound of
Young love uprising
Kicking and fighting
In this world of no restraint
Wake up to the sound of
Young love uprising
Kicking and fighting
For they know no other way
Nobody I know should be
Satisfied with nothing
Boxed in and forgotten
In this world of no restraint
We do the same
Different ways
No love no shame
We take no blame
We do the same
What's with all the tears
You know nothing ain't easy
I could be wrong, I could be dreaming
In this world of no restraint
Whatcha get for thinking
Work hard and try your best
One hard earned happiness
In this world of no restraint
We do the same
Different ways
No love no shame
We take no blame
We do the same
Despite all claims
We do the same different ways
We do the same

Gold and amber shining through swear by the moon
I'll wait for you
Silent treasures tender blushes
Soft surrender to discover
Feel the wings we whisper and sigh
As the angels glide on the touch of our skin
A fragile voice I hear that trembles and deceives
The deep blue oceans in your eyes desire grows inside
Veils of mist covered kisses
Swear by the moon I want you
Pearls of steam and the dance begins
Free the heat make us stronger still
No more promises we are here tonight
Come togehter in sweet firelight
Here untuil dawn sets us both apart
A love that's true swear by the moon I live for you, for you
For you, for you, forever for you
Precious hours fires dying down
While the night gives way to clear morning light
Perfumes gracing the senses of our souls
A love that's true swear by the moon
I'll be here for you, for you, forever for you
For you, for you, forever for you

Body, body, bo-bo-bo-body, body
Body to body
Body to body
Body to body
Nobody does it like you do
Body to body
I love the way you make me feel
When you do what you're doing to me, oh
Touching me the way you do, you know, know you've got to feel it too
When you body's next to mine, you've got me hypnotized
Body to body
Body to body
You know I like the way you do what you do when you do it to me, oh

Nobody does it like you do
Body to body
You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no
Oh, what you do
Flowing through this magic night
I love to feel you hold me tight
You are the one that's right for me
You got me feeling tingaly
Share the night with stars above
I think I've found this thing called love
Fever running through your eyes
You are my heavenly device
Body to body
Body to body
Body to body nobody does it like you do
Body to body
You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no
Oh, what you do
You opened up the world to me
You changed my life so tenderly
I know you are the only one
You're brighter than the burning sun
Don't know where you're going to
I don't care as long as I'm with you
That certain sparkle in your eyes
Has got me feeling oh so high
Body to body
Body to body
Body to body
Body to body
I like what you do when you do all those things to me
Body to body....

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't want to tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I want to set it off, but
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Hear voices I don?t want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
Maybe I just can?t believe it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
I can't deny, tired of trying
Open up the door, but just keep on seeing you
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh

Every little word
With every lesson learned
I think I know why hearts are made of stone
Every little pain
Fans a bitter flame
Nothing stops me loving you
Can't you see that we belong
Oh how I want it to be
So tell me do you feel the way I feel
Baby like the rose
Oh darling you put color in my life
Baby take my heart forever
Cause I don't want to be afraid
No no
Turn another page
The story will never fade
Sleep with thoughts of you until daylight
And when you're far away
Forever love will stay
Keep this loving feeling deep inside
Can't you see that we belong
Oh how I want it to be
So tell me do you feel the way I feel
Cause you're the color in my life

you bleached the night with your headlights. blinded and caught fire to all my secrecy. and now i'm burning down. can you take one good look around. there's more to see in this rain. i'm having trouble listening on the inside. there's too much going on. on the outside in the sun shine. gravel in my coffe again. headaches for a friend, from a friend. mutual flame extinguishing. and it's because of you. because of you, because of me. we'll never sleep again if we follow the creases. pick up the pieces and sift the gravel from my coffee.

Yeah I got all your messages
30 seems a bit excessive
Could I be less interested in you
What do I have to do to make you get the message
It couldn't be that hard to figure out
I haven't called you back since last December
You know it's summer now? Do you know it summer right now?
Chorus
Do you I have to dumb it down?
Do I have to dumb it down for you?
Sit your ass on the ground
Draw a picture with a line through you
(Dumb it down for you)
You don't seem to hear a thing I say
So let me spell it out another way
Maybe I'll C U Next Tuesday
What do I have to do to make you get the message
It couldn't be that hard to figure out
I haven't called you back since last December
You know it's summer now? Do you know it summer right now?
Chorus
Do you I have to dumb it down?
Do I have to dumb it down for you?
Sit your ass on the ground
Draw a picture with a line through you
(Dumb it down for you)
What do I have to do to make you get the message
It couldn't be that hard to figure out
I haven't called you back since last December
You know it's summer now? Do you know it summer right now?
Chorus
Do you I have to dumb it down?
Do I have to dumb it down for you?
Sit your ass on the ground
Draw a picture with a line through you
DUMB IT DOWN FOR YOU (repeat)

When morning comes to town
I'll be moving on
When evening comes back 'round
I'll be somewhere alone
Somewhere far away
What about you?
All things have to end
They have to and they do
And they do
We started to believe
To one another we belong
We know that?
You're not mine but I'm not yours
I never wanted this
For us to carry on
Knowing that it leaves
And knowing what we want
What we want
This way it is the way no rain?
I'm happy to go out like this
Happy is the word
I'll think of you always
For you know it as well as I
?
Would still die
When morning comes to town
Something?
And for all of time
Because of how we feel
?
Us afraid to be alone
Not saying anything
Knowing somethings wrong
Somethings wrong
This way it is the way no rain?
I'm happy to go out like this
Happy is the world

Lead me Lord
lead me by the hand
and help me face the rising sun
comfort me through all the pain
that life may bring
There's no other hope
that i can lean upon
Lead me Lord,
lead me all my life
Walk by me Walk by me
across the lonely roads that i may face
take my arms and let your hand
show me the way
Show the way to live inside your heart
All my days,
all my life...
(chorus)
You are my light
you're the lamp upon my feet
All the Time, my lord i need you there
You are my light
I can not live alone
let me stay, by your guiding love
All through my life
Lead me Lord...
Lead me Lord,
even though at times
i'd rather go along my way
help me take the right direction
Take your road
Lead me lord
and never leave my side
all my days, all my life...
(chorus)
You are my light
you're the lamp upon my feet
All the Time, my lord i need you there
You are my light
I can not live alone
let me stay, by your guiding love
All through my life...
You are my light
you're the lamp upon my feet
All the Time, my lord i need you there
You are my light
I can Me... oh, Lord...
repeat chorus.....
Lead me Lord......

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair, now
And wondering what dress to wear, now
I say a little prayer for you
[Chorus]
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me
I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work, I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you
[Chorus]
I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me
My darling, believe me
For me there is no one
But you

Vandals in ermine
Rip city skylines
Dodge truth and virtue
With slick city bylines
A paragon of virtue
Until they hurt you
In power and in status
We know they hate us
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Power is preaching
The virtues of poverty
Poor are left feeding
On cruel comedy...sad laughter
Rescue us all now
From fumes that choke us
Shift then these sad lives
Into sweet focus
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Prestige it sits high
On mammons alter
Porsche hungry pinheads
On champagne and oysters
Head full of hollow thoughts
Handful of sushi
Plug into dallas babe
Plug into dynasty
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Now i am loving
Where once i was hating
Leading a good life
Stopped paging satan
Played devils advocate
So many times
Lived in the shadows
But the sun will shine. shine. shine
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Where is the kingdom?
You say we squander?
Where the hell is the heaven?
Must we wait much longer?

Let's have a black celebration
Black Celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you
How you carry on
When all hope is gone
Can't you see
Your optimistic eyes
Seem like paradise
To someone like
Me
I want to take you
In my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Black Celebration
Black Celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you
And your strong belief
Me, I want relief
Tonight
Consolation
I want so much
Want to feel your touch
Tonight
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today
Black Celebration
I'll drink to that
Black Celebration

Tears roll down my face
Smiles can't take their place
Living down hanging around try to understand
All you gotta do us hold my hand
You don't understand
Try to see the plan
Cause if you start to falling
To the things you did before
You ain't gonna see me anymore
And it's high time
You got something going
Everything you did till now is wrong
Look like my time
I'd should be a knowing
I should find out before too long
SOLO
And it's high time
You got something going
Everything you did till now was wrong
Look like my time
I'd should be a knowing
I should find out before too long

Living this world as you see
Is too hard to take and too much for me
And everything's in blue
Walk in the rain spearing out
I can't find myself
Knowing the sun can be found
It always comes to
There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night
That's long
That can't find a day
As long as I can dream
There's a better world oh
There's a better world
I see it shining
And in my dreams I see
There's a better world oh
There's a better world
As long as I can dream
In my heart there's a place
And there's always hope and always a way
to make it through the night
(make it through the night)
In my soul have a ???
If I just have faith and I will be free
I will be alright (be alright)
There's not a soul that's lost
And can't find its way
There's not a night that long
that can't find the day
As long as I can dream
There's a better world oh
There's a better world
I see it shining
And in my dreams I see
There's a better world oh
There's a better world
As long as I can dream
Na na na na na na na na
Oh yeah ooh yeah

There's a better world
I see it shining, shining, shining
And in my dreams I see

As long as I can dream
As long as I can dream ah

So you little Italian devils,
You want to know about love?
Saraghina will tell you.
If you want to make a woman happy,
You lie on what you're born with,
Because it is in your blood.
Be Italian
Be Italian
Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss
Be Italian
Be Italian
When you hold me don't just hold me but hold this
Please be gentle, sentimental
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat
But be daring and uncaring
When you pinch me try to pinch me where there's fat
HA!
Be a singer be a lover
Pick the flower now before the chance is past
Be Italian
Be Italian
Live today as if it may become your last!
Hey!
Be a singer be a lover
Pick the flower now before the chance is past
Be Italian
Be Italian
Live today as if it may become your last!

Trying to be
To be so strong
I look into your eyes
And say hello
So hopelessly
I wait for your reply
When suddenly you grab me close
And press your lips to mine
You read my mind
Every memory
Every embrace
Every time my lips touch your face
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
Every single touch
Every on my mind
Cross my heart
Don't know why
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
Loving you
And hopin' I'll be
That I'll be strong
I looked into your eyes
And say goodbye
And as I step away
The pains too much
And I turn my face to see your open arms
And I run to you, to you
Every memory (oh)
Every embrace (oh yeah)
Every time my lips touch your face (yeah)
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you (oh no no)
It's nothing like loving you
Every single touch
Every on my mind (My mind)

Every single touch
Every on my mind
Cross my heart
Don't know why
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
Loving you

As much as I've been trying to say
As much as I appear okay
I'm holding on, pretending nothing is wrong
There's many things I wanna see
But first of all I gotta see me 'cause I can't breathe
Now that we're over, life's getting colder
Trying so hard to feel the sun
Can I begin to re-live my life?
Release all the pain inside
Over done now, I wanna love again
Every day is a different vibe
Up and down like a fairground ride
Over done now
How can I begin?
Oh, oh, oh
How can I begin?
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not trying win
Oh, oh, oh
How can I begin?
To love again
Situated in my bed
Pictures running through my head
Some are good
Some wish I never took no, no
The probability of me
Feeling down and lonely
I'm no longer scared
Now that we're over, life is getting colder
Trying so hard to feel the sun
Can I begin to re-live my life?
And release all the pain inside
Over done now, I wanna love again
Every day is a different vibe
Up and down like a fairground ride
Over done now
How can I begin?
Oh, oh, oh
How can I begin?
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not trying win
Oh, oh, oh
How can I begin?
To love again
Hold on
When all the hope is gone
I'm starting at the ending
And I'll just move on
Fall down, still wearing my crown
Nothing's gonna hurt me
'Cause what goes around comes around
Yeah, oh, oh
What goes around comes around
Baby, can I begin to re-live my life?
And release all the pain inside
Over done now
How can I begin?
Oh, oh, oh
How can I begin?
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not trying to win
Oh, oh, oh
How can I begin?
To love again

the cells of this body
have all lost their memory
confused by each other
to work out of order
and i hate that they require
the need to be together
how could they go wrong
this terrible anatomy
will surely get the best of me
maybe they'd grow in someone else
we head back to your place
its not such a nice place
i'm still a little nervous
i thought you would notice
and i hate that this requires
for us to be together
maybe i was wrong
a simple little strategy
to get rid of all thats wrong with me
maybe they'd grow in someone else
watch as they grow in someone else

my smiles are pretend
and no matter what you do
I'll never be the one for you
you can shower me with gifts
but I'll never want your lips
I don't love you
I don't really want to hurt you
but I tried so hard to warn you
but you smiled and walked away
you may think that maybe time
can make me want you
please stop trying
understand you're not the man
every time I close my eyes I see him
remembering how it feels
keeps getting stronger, can't wait no longer
I wanna live my life with the one I love
and I feel alive when I think about him
touching me and kissing me all night long
please don't let this go on
do the right thing, tell them why
'cause it ain't right to live a lie
we followed tradition
to make them happy, but loves a decision
you can.t take lightly
open your eyes
I don't really want to hurt you
but I tried so hard to warn you
but you smiled and walked away
you may think that maybe time
can make me want you
please stop trying
understand you're not the man
true love lets your heart decide
who and where it wants to be
and everytime I hear his name
I fall in love with him again
'cause he's the only man that's made for me
everytime I close my eyes I see him
remembering how it feels
keeps getting stronger, can't wait no longer
I wanna live my life with the one I love
and I feel alive when I think about him
touching me and kissing me all night long

Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Come on and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Sprawled out on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Girl, get a grip, come on, pull it together
It's only a sun shower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a "Dear Ja" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my baby be mine
Here at W-I-Z we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the muthafuckin hits

I wish I had your pair of wings
Had them last night in my dreams
I was chasing butterflies
Till the sunrise broke my eyes
Tonight the sky has glued my eyes
Cause what they see's an angel hive
I've got to touch that magic sky
And greet the angels in their hive
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
And all the sweet honey from above
Pour it all over me sweet love
And while you're flying around my head
Your honey kisses keep me fed
I wish I had a pair of wings
Just like last night in my dreams
I was lost in paradise
I wish I'd never opened my eyes
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
But there's danger in the air
Tryin' so hard to be unfair
Danger's in the air
Tryin' so hard to give us a scare
But we're not afraid
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
I wish I were you
I wish I were you

I'm a woman
Lord knows it's hard
I need a real man to give me what I need
Sweet attention, love and tenderness
When it's real, it's unconditional
I'm telling y'all
'Cause a man just ain't a man
If he ain't man enough to
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feeling low
He's giving you his last
'Cause he's thinking of you first
Giving comfort when he's thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done
When you really love someone
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling y'all
'Cause you're a real man
Lord knows it's hard
Sometimes you just need a woman's touch
Sweet affection, love and support
When it's real it's unconditional
I'm telling y'all
'Cause a woman ain't a woman
If she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feeling low
She's giving you her best
Even when you're at your worse
Giving comfort when she's thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done
When you really love someone
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling y'all
Sometimes you wanna argue
Sometimes you wanna fight
Sometimes it's gonna feel like it'll never be right
But something so strong keeps you holding on
It don't make sense but it make a good song
'Cause a man just ain't a man
If he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher
When the world got you feeling low
He's giving you his last
Cause he's thinking of you first
Giving comfort when he's thinking that you're hurt
Oh, that's what's done
When you really love someone
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling you
That a woman just ain't a woman
If she ain't woman enough to
Love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher and higher
When the world got you feeling low
She's giving you her best
Even when you're at your worse
Giving comfort when she's thinking that you're hurt
That's what's done
When you really love someone
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling y'all
I'm telling y'all
Hm hm yeah

Oh baby baby I'm in love with you
I really need you to feel the same way too
Oh baby baby when I feel so blue
I close my eyes and I know you are the one for me
Do you really know what I feel for you?
I think your love's gotta something new
I really want you to be my boy
I know you want me too
Nothing's gonna change what you mean to me
I need you baby to set me free
So give me time to say how much I love you boy!
Oh baby baby I'm in love with you
I really need you to feel the same way too
Oh baby baby when I feel so blue
I close my eyes and I know you are the one for me!
Do you know the way I feel for you?
Without you baby I can't through
And I know that you love me boy
It's like a dream come true
Nothing's gonna take it away from me
I need your love and let it be
So give me time to say how much I love you boy
Oh baby baby I'm in love with you
I really need you to feel the same way too
Oh baby baby when I feel so blue
I close my eyes and I know you are the one for me

Maybe if I lay real still
It will go away, maybe it will
Maybe this time I won't budge
Maybe I just need a little nudge
Maybe this time I won't flinch
Maybe this time it might be a sinch
Maybe this time I won't run
Maybe I'll own up to what I've done
What have I done?
What have I done?
Maybe I'm just damaged goods
And, baby, you're a babe in the woods
And me, I'm just a little lost lamb
But you love me wherever I am
And maybe I've been caught red handed
Making off like a lucky bandit
And this wasn't how I planned it
Maybe this time I could stay
And let myself get carried away
Maybe this time it's too late
We could make a move or we could wait
Maybe she will understand
And not expect too much from one man
Maybe she can or maybe she can't
Maybe when I've changed my tune
I'll come out of my solitude
And start to live my life anew
And spend the rest of my days pleasing you
And on the path to righteousness
I'll swept the dust
Whatever it takes to gain your trust
I'll do what I must
I'll do what I must
I'll do what I must
I'll do what I must
I'll do what I must do
I'll do it up
Maybe I'm just damaged goods
And, baby, you're a babe in the woods
And me, I'm just a little lost lamb
But you love me wherever I am
And maybe I've been caught red handed
Making off like a lucky bandit
And now I walk this planet
Forever it's a joke, the alternative to love
Forever it's a joke, the alternative to love
Forever it's a joke, the alternative to love
...

Time has come to get the troops back together
No one's cruising for a bruising
It's a landslide, can't die
Time to get what's coming to me
Time to let things go
There is no way to stop the yellow danger
Time has come for you

You've been warned now
Either join or step aside

You've got a sweet tooth
You only want what's bad for you
You're making your move
You're hungry for what I could do
Leavin' you tongue-tied
I'll take you to the other side
Your body's designed
To take it like a man tonight
(Oo oo oo oo)
You, me and cherry wine
You got me feelin' fine
It happens all the time
(Oo oo oo oo)
Love me or love me not
I don't want this to stop
I'll be your cherry on top
The only girl to make your eyeballs pop
The sweetest thing you ever caught
Come grab a taste while it's still hot
But I don't need a man who will always think twice
I'm a combination of naughty and nice
Boy if you want what I've got
I could be your cherry on top
It's kinda blurry
This ringin' in my ear's so loud
By seven thirty
I'm ready for the second round
The second round
(Oo oo oo oo)
You, me and cherry wine
You got me feelin' fine
It happens all the time
(Oo oo oo oo)
Love me or love me not
I don't want this to stop
I'll be your cherry on top
The only girl to make your eyeballs pop
The sweetest thing you ever caught
Come grab a taste while it's still hot
But I don't need a man who will always think twice
I'm a combination of naughty and nice
Boy if you want what I've got
I could be your cherry on top
On top
Boy I know you're missin' out on something
(Missing out on something)
I'll be the girl to keep your heartbeat jumpin'
(Keep your heartbeat jumpin')
Boy I know you're missin' out on something
(Missing out on something)
I'll be the girl to keep your heartbeat jumpin'
(Heartbeat jumpin', heartbeat)
I'll be your cherry on top
The only girl to make your eyeballs pop
The sweetest thing you ever caught
Come grab a taste while it's still hot
But I don't need a man who will always think twice
I'm a combination of naughty and nice
Boy if you want what I've got
I could be your cherry on top
On top

Line one is the time
That you, you first stayed over at mine
And we drank our first bottle of wine
And we cried
Line two we're away
And we both, we both had nowhere to stay
Well the bus-shelter's always OK
When you're young
Now you're older and I look at your face
Every wrinkle is so easy to place
And I only write them down just in case
That you die
Let's take a look at these crows feet, just look
Sitting on the prettiest eyes
Sixty 25th of Decembers
Fifty-nine 4th of Julys
Not through the age or the failure, children
Not through the hate or despise
Take a good look at these crows feet
Sitting on the prettiest eyes
Line three I forget
But I think, I think it was our first ever bet
And the horse we backed was short of a leg
Never mind
Line four in a park
And the things, the things that people do in the dark
I could hear the faintest beat of your heart
Then we did
Now you're older and I look at your face
Every wrinkle is so easy to place
And I only write them down just in case
You should die
Lets take a look at these crows feet, just look
Sitting on the prettiest eyes
Sixty 25th of Decembers
Fifty-nine 4th of Julys
You can't have too many good times, children
You can't have too many lines
Take a good look at these crows feet
Sitting on the prettiest eyes
Well my eyes look like a map of the town
And my teeth are either yellow or they're brown
But you'll never hear the crack of a frown
When you are here
You'll never hear the crack
Of a frown

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five"
They played the mash
They played the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
They played the mash
They played the monster mash
Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash
It's caught on in a flash
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash
The monster mash
And do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash

"Come to the well", she said
"Come, eat my bread, come drink the water of life
Enter my valley deep, let the angels weep
Rejoice and touch the good Earth tonight"
And there was gingham and silk
Sage, honey and milk, sweetmeats, spirits and wine
She bathed us in sweet balms of rose
Lit candles of clove and lay her glistening body on mine
We lay locked in love, in leaves of green and gold
She touched, I trembled, we kissed
I poured the contents of my aching heart and soul
Soon she woke up with the sun
Filled with seeds of worlds to come
"Come to the well", she said
"Come, eat my bread
Come and drink the water of life"

Beautiful child in razor heels,
Sashays into the room.
All the boys, they catch their breath,
And the mirrors swoon.
Now she's running down the hall,
Head scarf, and a Hollywood smile.
She's got a dagger in your back,
And a killing style.
Love and hate, it's all the same your way,
Just another twisted game to play.
Evil, child star, movie queen.
Evil, sweet charm, Mabeline.
Evil, no one gets the better of me.
Your father's rage and a cocktail dress,
With a bullet proof heart.
Why is your life in such a mess,
If you're so damn smart?
Judy Garland, Jimmy Dean;
You tragedy queen.
Give me fat girls, give me rough boys,
Give me what I dream.
Love and hate, it's all the same your way,
Just another twisted game to play.
Evil, child star, movie queen.
Evil, sweet charm, Mabeline.
Evil, such a pretty boy that I've never seen.
Love and hate, it's all the same your way,
Just another twisted game to play.
Evil, child star, movie queen.
Evil, the sweet charm, Mabeline.
Evil, no one gets the better of me.
Evil.
Evil.
Evil.
No one gets the better
No one gets the better
No one gets the better

I swear
I swore
Boiled pain
We can't stay his
I swear
I swore
By and by
By and by
(x3)

Read in the paper nearly day
People breakin' up and just walkin' away from love and that's wrong
That's so wrong
A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
When neither one of them will love and understa-a-a-a-and
And take it with a grain of salt
Oh, now believe that
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And even the sad love is better than no love at a-l-l
Got to believe that
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
No love at all is a poor old man
Standin' on the corner with his hat in his hand
And no place to go, he's feelin' low
No love at all is a child in the street
Dodgin' traffic and beggin' to eat on a tenement row
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
Standin' on a bridge at the end of the wor-or-or-or-ld
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And even the sad love is better than no love at a-l-l
Got to believe that
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Oh you got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And even the sad is better than no love at a-l-l
Got to believe me
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Got to believe me
Fade
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind

Making impressions in the sand.I use my feet..I use my hands.I make my mark on my land.I have the power to be free.Power to plan my destiny.You too can learn..you can be free.Soo rise and dust your ball and chains.The sky is calling you.Calling you outside to watch your pride.Don't fall prey to insecurity no.A champion...you were free.Happiness exists inside your mind..deep inside your mind.Wisdom's my goal..love is my pride.When I get lonely I hide inside.Hope comes in and takes me for a ride.I've been told so many lies ..these lies I have to analyze.Sure enough when the wind begins to blow.Fear and doubt can make you feel so poor.When patience starts to show...look inside your mind and you will know.You have to rise and dust your ball and chains.Happiness exists you'll find it deep inside your mind.Deep inside your mind(3x).Happiness exists you'll find it deep inside your mind.Get up get up come on get in deep inside your mind.Happiness exits you'll find it deep inside your mind.

Rock, rock, rock
Swing, baby, swing

You got one mile to go

A bullet to my head
And they're driving me insane
And they don't stop
You say, hold on tight for the ride
Yeah, you're my destination
And you rock me all night long
Yeah, you push me all night long
Yeah, you love me all night long
You rock me all night long

Live, baby, live there for today
Fly, baby, fly, let's get away

And you know, yeah, you know
That you rock me
Yeah, you rock me, oh yeah
De de de de, rock me, all night long
Yeah, you push me all night long
Yeah, you love me all night long

In a dark winter Tokyo
In the Majong parlor he waits
Seven pasts thrumming through his heads
Though he comes to the water ways
In the hallways they lie in bed
Dream the red loss of all their days
In your arms there is nothing left
But we are all on the way
My whole life
Is the mystery
That I can't bear
Oh wings
That are camery
Upon this day
I would love to heal you now
In a dark winter Tokyo
In the Mahjong parlors they wait
Severed pasts sweeping through their hands
No one comes to the water way
In the hour of the all
There is notes along the way
All I wanted to see
Is that I am better
All I want to believe
Is that I am better
Round and round
All I wanted to see
Is that I am better
round and round

I would love to get to know you more
To spend a lot of time with you
Maybe travel around with you
Because you've got such a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
Singing this song to you
I would love to hold you close
Maybe rub your nose with my nose
You've got such a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
Go let it shine
Girl I want to show you what you mean to me
(Have you really got the time?)
We should get to know each other better
(Have you really got the time?)
You could think about the words I'm singing
Have you got the time?
Have you really got the time?
You're so sensuous it's true
Got to let you know some how
I could never turn my back on you
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
Sunshine enrapture me
Take some time and we will see
I just want you to be aware
You've got such a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
You've got a beautiful nature
Go let it shine, go let it shine
You got to let it shine, go let it shine

Pleasure, little treasure
Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason
I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure
Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's talking about the state of the nation
Everybody's looking for a promised land
Everybody's failing to understand

@SONG: SEA OF SIN -- Released on single with "World in My Eyes"
Sea of Sin I'm spinning in and I'm taking a dive
My mind's in need so my body feeds and it keeps me alive
It gets better and better as it gets wetter and wetter
Sea of Sin know where you've been but I don't care
Sea of Sin through thick and thin "oh and betting with words"
My mind's in need so my body feeds and it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper as we sink deeper and deeper
Sea of Sin know where you've been 'cause I've been there
Here under God's fire
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize
Sea of Sin my second skin my other home
when I'm in doubt my hands reach out and I'm never alone
It gets wetter and wetter as it gets better and better
Sea of Sin know where you've been and I'm prepared
Sea of Sin know where you've been yes I'm aware
Sea of Sin know where you've been 'cause I've been there
Sea of Sin know where you've been and I don't care
Sea of Sin know where you've been and I don't care

Betcha didn't know that I'd be back, ya better put down the pipe
Stay off that crack, sober up and get some sense, I'm gonna
Take you higher than Manhattan rents better get on up and put it down
Party people lets gather around, it's plain to see, I'm Hello B
Here to get it started A S A P, I study hard and I pass my tests
Never let the haters ever get me stressed, my crews the best
And they got my back, my bodyguard Kev may give you a smack
But he'll leave you alone if you behave this ain't White Castle
But I'm what you crave I need you all to feel me here
Guys and girls in the front and rear
Knock 'em out the box and jack it up
Turn it back around and crack it up
Gotta get outta town then pack it up
Killin' me soft Roberta Flack it up
All of my pimps gotta mack it up
Cuties with booties better back it up
Put 'em on the wall just tack it up
Everybody take your hands and smack it up
Off the meat rack and off the chain, make you go crazy
Make you go insane, it's about to rain but it's no thang
Gucci umbrellas I'm openin' gotta change the weather and take a trip
A little r 'n' r so I don't slip hop on a ship, better yet a plane
Head Down South with no delayin' in a under a day New York to J.A.
Take in the sun you know catch some rays back on the jet fly to JFK
Gotta do an interview, what can I say, I'm in demand
The number one choice here to rock the place for the girls and boys
If you know what I mean, I wanna hear you shout
Now it's my turn to turn it out
Knock 'em out the box and jack it up
Turn it back around and crack it up
Gotta get outta town then pack it up
Killin' me soft Roberta Flack it up
All of my pimps gotta mack it up
Cuties with booties better back it up
Put 'em on the wall just tack it up
Everybody take your hands and smack it up
Photo shoots are a daily thing, people linin' up just to hear me sing
If you gimme a ring then I'll be true, psyche I'm too young
And you're a damn fool, you better stay in school and get good grades
Bag it on up don't wanna catch aids like you wit diseases
And other stuff you try to battle my crew but we're too damn tough
Powder puff, dandruff, little black hoody girl, huff and puff
And blow this house right on down everybody gettin' Krunk
In every town, the champion sound control the place
Stylistic gals in a rude boy face no time to waste let's get it on
Get up and do your thing to this song
Knock 'em out the box and jack it up
Turn it back around and crack it up
Gotta get outta town then pack it up
Killin' me soft Roberta Flack it up
All of my pimps gotta mack it up
Cuties with booties better back it up
Put 'em on the wall just tack it up
Everybody take your hands and smack it up
Knock 'em out the box and jack it up
Turn it back around and crack it up
Gotta get outta town then pack it up
Killin' me soft Roberta Flack it up
All of my pimps gotta mack it up
Cuties with booties better back it up
Put 'em on the wall just tack it up
Everybody take your hands and smack it up

Looking out of the window
Can't believe what I see
Where was all this beauty when I loved you
From now on this is my world
Yes we lost but I don't hurt any more
I knew there must be more to life than this
Now is the time for me
I'm grateful, you set me free
Baby one good turn deserves another
Now is the time for you
Pray our dreams come true
Could not see the world around me
You were my world
But now I keep inside my heart a Brave New Hope
There is no need to worry
I'll find my place in the sun
Better days are here to stay forever
Times are changing so am I
Not alone 'cause there's a heart needing love
I know that God will give me one more chance
Everything seems new
Have to get to know my friends again
I never realized that it could be like this
Time is a love continuum
And I've got so much love to give
I'm not afraid to start this journey again tomorrow

Hey girl, no me sigas suplicando
Ya no con tus cuentos tan baratos
Déjalo, tus lágrimas son un golpe de teatro
Ya ves, me perdiste para siempre
Para ti quizás no fui suficiente
Apártate, que yo no soy, ni seré un segundo plato
Te di mi alma y perdiste la calma
Niña, don't you think I'm blind (don't you think I'm blind)
Te di mi abrazo Y me hiciste pedazos
No, baby leave me! (Es lo que hay)
Hey girl, todo terminó
Estás loca si tu crees
Que esto es cosa de tres, no, no
Léeme los labios bye, bye, ciao
Hey girl, who you think I am?
Se acabó la fiesta ya
Despedirnos es vital,
Adiós, esto ya se acabo
Niña déjalo
See you baby en otros brazos
You know you got-got what you're looking for
You know you got-got what you're looking for
You know you got-got what you're looking for
So don't come around asking me for more
Sabes que yo te he siempre confiado
Y ya ves he salido trasquilado
Mirame, now read my lips que te de lo que has buscado
Pensar que te ame como un ingenuo
Y mi amor arrastraste por el suelo
Se acabó, y prueba tú el dolor que me has causado
Te di mi vida
Y fuiste una niña
And it's a woman what I need, yeah
Piensa algun dia pudiste ser mía
Tú, solo para mi
Hey girl, todo terminó
Estás loca si tu crees
Que esto es cosa de tres, no , no
Léeme los labios bye, bye, ciao
Hey girl, who you think I am?
Se acabó la fiesta ya , despedirnos es vital
Adiós, esto ya se acabo
Niña déjalo,
See you baby en otros brazos
Yo seré
El que te entrego su vida una vez
Niña tú perdiste la ocasión
Tú serás
Un recuerdo que jamas podre borrar
Esa que yo ame y no me supo amar
Her girl, todo terminó
Estás loca si tu crees
Que esto es cosa de tres, no, no
Léeme los labios bye, bye, ciao
Her girl, who you think I am?
Se acabó la fiesta ya
Despedirnos es vital
Adiós esto ya se acabo
Niña déjalo
See you baby en otros brazos
You know you got-got what you're looking for
You know you got-got what you're looking for
You know you got-got what you're looking for
So don't come around asking me for more

My little girl
Won't you come with me
Come with me
And tell me
Is there something to do
I'm going crazy with boredom
Come with me
Tell me
Grey sky over a black town
I can feel depression
All around
You've got your leather boots on
I can't stand another drink
It's surprising this town
Doesn't sink
You've got your leather boots on
Your pretty dress is oil stained
From working too hard
For too little
You've got your leather boots on
You're feeling the boredom too
I'd gladly go with you
I'd put your leather boots on
I'd put your pretty dress on

So don't go wastin' your time
Holding on to your life
There are treasures that I have possessed
Meant the world to me
But they never fill the emptiness
I needed something more than these
In the middle of my wilderness
God reached down to me
When I let go to His tenderness
I found His love was more than I ever dreamed
So don't go wastin' your time
Holding on to your life
Just lay it all on the line
Gotta make up your mind
There can be no more compromise
Just lay it all on the line
It's a matter of surrendering
Every hidden fear
And by letting go of everything
Jesus will meet you there
In the heart of everyone of us
There's a call to faith
Even though we'll never measure up
That's why the Savior, that's why the Savior came
So don't go wastin' your time
Holding on to your life
Just lay it all on the line
Gotta make up your mind
There can be no more compromise
Just lay it all on the line
So don't go wastin' your time
Holding on to your life
Just lay it all on the line
Gotta make up your mind
There can be no more compromise
Just lay it all on the line
Gone are the days of holding on
This is the time to surrender
Now is the moment you've got to let it go
Just let go, just let go, just let it go now
Don't go wastin', wastin' your time
Gotta make up, make up your mind
There can be no more compromise
Just lay it all on the line
So don't go wastin' your time
Holding on to your life
Just lay it all on the line
Gotta make up your mind
There can be no more compromise
Just lay it all on the line

Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last?
Look don't touch you're asking much!

For the longest time
It's been on my mind
Was trying to understand
I've been looking for
That part of me
Out of touch and out of hand
Everything I thought I knew
Love proved me wrong
For all the times that I held on
I shouldn've let go
[Chorus:]
Cause when you find the one you'll know
She's the heart inside your soul
She's the one that looks at you and gives
The feeling you've come home
There's a place it all begins
Where together never ends
And the more we are the more we
Feel the same
One true flame
All the foolish games
That we have to play
To learn from our mistakes
We go on n'on
We convince ourselves
That this is what it takes
But nothing's really what it seems
And no one really knows
It's only now that I can see
And realize
[Chorus]
Oh you're everything, that I ever dreamed
But never had 'til now
Looking back I see It was meant to be
It was you that showed me how
Thought I've been loved before
But I wasn't even close
[Chorus x2]

I've got a secret, been hiding oh so long
Trying hard to keep it and never tell anyone, but
It's getting hard a little harder every day
I feel it moving inside me, moving in mysterious ways
And I'm not alone no matter what I do
No matter where I go I know, I'm gonna be with You
[Chorus]
Your love is working in my life, I can feel it every day
You pick me up and take me higher
But I'm not afraid 'cause I know Your love is working in my life
Always so independent, thought I could stand alone
I never needed anything from anyone
But since You found me and I found You, You reached out to me
And showed me what the power of love can do
[Chorus]
I don't know just where this road is leading
But as long as You hold my hand, I'll keep believing
[Chorus]
No I am not afraid 'cause I know Your love is working in my life

She stopped me in the doorway
She kissed me on the lips
I don't even know her
That's just the way it is
(That's just the way it is)
Then she touched my hand
(Then she touched my hand)
And told me I should be her man
(Told me I should be her man)
T-t-to show her how to dance
(T-t-to show her how to dance)
This is my one and only chance
(And that's just romance)
No, I don't wanna be
The guy to see you go
And I don't wanna leave
If you don't take me home
I don't want to see
You walk away from me
I got everything that you could ever need
No, I don't wanna be
The guy to see you go
Now I'm seeing double
I'm leaning on a pool cue
I'm aiming for that black ball
'Cause tonight there ain't no last call
Pour me a pitcher of the cheap stuff
(Of the cheap stuff)
To chase the taste of these cheap shots
(Of these cheap shots)
Turn it up on the jukebox
(T-t-turn it up)
I don't wanna have to talk
(I don't wanna have to talk)
No, I don't wanna be
The guy to see you go
And I don't wanna leave
If you don't take me home
I don't want to see
You walk away from me
I got everything that you could ever need
No, I don't wanna be
The guy to see you go
'Cause I don't want to see you leave
I grab my coat and you grab your keys
We're all alone
I find your lips
Take me home for a goodnight kiss
'Cause I don't want to see you leave
I grab my coat and you grab your keys
We're all alone
I find your lips
Take me home for a goodnight kiss
No, I don't wanna be
The guy to see you go
And I don't wanna leave
If you don't take me home
I don't want to see
You walk away from me
I got everything that you could ever need
No, I don't wanna be
The guy to see you go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Close comes this winter
Summer is no longer
And things, they seem much bleaker
We'll see a Catherine Deneuve double feature
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe
(Double feature, you will survive
Last forever so rest your eyes
Play with words when we cannot sing
This double feature means everything)

Floorfiller, floorfiller, floorfiller
Hey Mr. DJ, in case you forgot
I came to get down, so you better make it hot
'Cause I can't jump around when I hear groove killers
When I'm out sitting down, it's a clear time stealer
Give me a track with a phat kind of beat
A groove so unique that it kicks me off my seat
'Cause I won't find a mood with a new spine chiller
When the crowd hits the room, it's a true crowd thriller
Freeze, better make it hot
Music please, blow the spot
Play that funky music
That is how we want it, floorfiller
That is how we need it, floorfiller
Something's outta order, people in the corners
Don't you see it, can't you feel it?
Floorfiller
Crank up a bass that can raise up the roof
A bomb diggy drum comin' at me with a poof
Gotta boom, shake the room 'cause we're all heat seekers
With a jam that can slam down the walls, mindfreaker
Freeze, better make it hot
Music please, blow the spot
Play that funky music
That is how we want it, floorfiller
That is how we need it, floorfiller
Something's outta order, people in the corners
Don't you see it, can't you feel it?
You know by the sounds when the crowd is getting wild
Hands swinging high like a chopper in the sky
But a slow bump or flow ain't the way, floor freezer
See the name of the game is to play, crowd pleaser
Freeze, better make it hot
Music please, blow the spot
Play that funky music
That is how we want it, floorfiller
That is how we need it, showfiller
Something's outta order, people in the corners
Don't you see it, can't you feel it?
That is how we want it, floorfiller
That is how we need it, floorfiller
Something's outta order, people in the corners
Don't you see it, can't you feel it?

It's late at night and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh I can't breathe thinking of your smile
Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see
Cause I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying
Baby you know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us
I just wanna be with you
Cause living is so hard to do
When all I know is trapped inside your eyes
The future I cannot forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see
'Cause I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying
Baby you know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us
Baby can you feel it (feel it)
You know I can hear it (hear it)
So can you feel me feel you
You know it's time
Baby you know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that
Maybe it's time for miracles
Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know I ain't giving up on us
Whoa giving up on
Oh I ain't giving up on us

HOT TEMPTATION
It's show time
Makes us proud
No matter how deep you are in a crowd
Be shaking your thing like Mr. Brown
Break ya neck lay back and say it loud
It's Bro'Sis once again baby
Round 2 ding ding just in time lady
Hot temptation all night long
Till the break of dawn
When the nightshift's taking over
No need to tell you ''cause you'll know
When the girls are in the world is out
They've come to steel the show
The heels are high - my stile is wild
You're scared to come too close
And if you treat me like a lady
I need to let you know
I'm in it for the hot temptation
Sing it - feel it - Minute by Minute
I ai'n talkin' 'bout a sweet relation
Said it - get it - come on
While the groove is getting deeper
And the lights are burnin' low
Got a feeling that we soon can't control
Now's the time to let go
Hot and steamy I know you can see me
Livin' out my dream
She is just an ordinary lady
Who likes to cause a scene
I'm in it for the hot temptation
Sing it - feel it - Minute by Minute
I ai'n talkin' 'bout a sweet relation
Said it - get it - come on
I'm in it for the hot temptation
Sing it - feel it - Minute by Minute
I ai'n talkin' 'bout a sweet relation
Said it - get it - come on
Hot temptation knowin' what it is
Bring an new breeze style the music buisiness
Jumpin' all about when the nightshift's over
Grab you a girl and scream HO
We beg the saiznitz
Runnin' with the nubiz
Y'all gotta roll with this
rough sometimes we come thru
Comin' thru 2 captures
With them heard stix
Steppin' up we be Bro'Sis
Pigidipass the mike to me
GIOs in the place to be
For real all rights deserves by my boys and girls
Bro'Sis is the name
Making rumble in the jumble
Like the king and say HEY HEY HEY
I got to pick up
Can I pick you up and stay stay
your heels are high but I got style what
Tonight is the night
Give it up for the hot temptation
I'm in it for the hot temptation
Sing it - feel it - Minute by Minute
I ai'n talkin' 'bout a sweet relation
Said it - get it - come on
I'm in it for the hot temptation
Sing it - feel it - Minute by Minute
I ai'n talkin' 'bout a sweet relation
Said it - get it - come on

Can't stand it when you're away
Without a doubt,
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Yeah baby, and I just can't wait
To have you by my side
You know whenever you're around
A smile is all that you're gonna see
Cause you make me feel so good inside
And there is no doubt, yeah I'm satisfied
BRIDGE:
I know that I won't find a better love
I got a love that other girls dream of
CHORUS:
We got a love thang
Feels so good to me
This is our thang
That's how a love should be
We got a, we got a love
We got a, we got a love
We got a, that's how a love should be
I used to be lonely
Cause I couldn't find someone
That I could call my own
Oh no, suddenly you stepped in my life
Now you're here with me and
All my lonely days are gone
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But it's better than a lonely night
BRIDGE

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)
From day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

Do anything you want
But never find the heart to leave me
'Cause I need you too much
So play your game but don't desert me
Maybe you heard I'm tough
To love but baby please believe me
Don't be afraid to trust me
I wouldn't trade you for the world
And if you feel you gotta test me
Before you be my girl
You can shake me
An' you can break me
But you can't make me
'Cause that's the only thing I won't do for you
Sometimes I say too much
I am right now so please forgive me
When I can't help but touch
The place so deep inside you in me
I threw away my crutch
I'm on up for you can't you see me?
Don't be afraid to try me
Come on and give a guy a whirl
And if you feel you gotta test me
Before you be my girl
An' you can shake me
An' you can break me
But you can't make me
'Cause that's the only thing I won't do for you
When I was making love inside my mind
Somehow you take me to the other side
I wanna get so deep inside your world
So don't run away girl
An' you can shake me
An' you can break me, oh yea
But you can't make me
'Cause that's the, the only thing I won't do for you
Shake me
An' you can break me
But you can't make me, yea
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna make you mine
An' you can shake me
An' you can break me
But you can't make me
'Cause that's the only thing I won't do for you
An' you can shake me
An' you can break me
But you can't make me
'Cause that's

Dear Wally I'm writing this letter sincerely
To tell you you're the sweetest boy I've ever known
Remember the USO when we met
You almost didn't go
Well, me and your two sons are very glad you did
When your eyes found me I could hardly breathe
I wanted you
Glad you wanted me
I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, on the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more
That night was pure magic
Who would have imagined
It would become 55 loving wonderful years
Your job was not all easy
Those last years I could hardly speak
But when I looked at you, I knew nothing had changed
And when I was leaving
I could feel you hurting
But then I saw those angels
And I knew your love would want this for me
I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, on the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more, more, more, more ,more
So while you're waiting
Know that I'm saying I love you
I love you
I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, on the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, On the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more
Dear Wally

When you think you lost your mind
And the steps you're takin'
Leave you three, four steps behind
But the road you're walking
Might be long sometimes
You just keep on steppin'
And you'll just be fine, yeah
Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Well there maybe times
When you wish you wasn't born
And you wake one morning
Just to find your courage's gone
But just know that feeling
Only last a little while
You stick with us
And we'll show you how to smile, yeah
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, get 'em up ease on down

Verse 1:
Any minute now you'll be walking out your door
With that vibe I've never seen before
Every part of your existence fill with originality
And elegence but,
I can feel you, loser in this game of love
The key to your heart belongs to another
Though I know we can't be, I pray for you
Cause I know there is no other for me
Chorus:
I'm going crazy,
Head over heals in a love I can't get out of even if I tried
I'm going crazy,
Thought I could get away but i can't deny that I'm in love
I'm going crazy,
Head over heals in a love I can't get out of even if I tried
I'm going crazy,
Thought I could get away but i can't deny
Verse 2:
I admire your face and your ways from a far
Want to know more about who you are
Wishing time and again that I was your friend
I'd show you I could be a star
Hurt me everytime I felt sorrow in your eyes
Cause I know for sure that it was from him
Makes me wonder why you stick around
While your heart gets beat down on the ground
Chorus
Verse 3:
Love
Thought I got away from you
In the nick of time
So I find that I can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
And I need you to sleep baby
No one can beat baby
I'm gong crazy
Chorus

You don't call me anymore
But don't you think that I don't care
I check the numbers every night
Just to see if you are there
Was it just another love affair?
Was it just another love affair? Ooh
My clock goes ticking through the night
Counting the seconds I don't sleep
I wish that I could turn back time
But some things were never meant to keep
Was it just another love affair?
(Was it just a love affair)
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)
Was it just another love affair?
(Was it just a love affair)
(Another love affair, another love affair)
It will never be the same
It will never be the same
It will never be the same
Without you
(Oh)
Will never be the same, will never be the same
Will never be the same, will never be the same
Will never be the same, will never be the same
Will never be the same, never be the same
And remember how we once were
When you held me so closely
We were breathing in the dark light
There was no more pain
One love, one heart, one soul together, ooh
Was it just another love affair?
(Was it just a love affair)
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)
Was it just another love affair?
(Was it just a love affair)
(Another love affair, another love affair, oh)

Not now, pressing tight
Children run, the mothers cry
All my dreams are wasting now
No more reason, I see this now
As I watch you from the road
My mind did open, the reason man
My mind did open, reason man
Government amusement, there's something to say
Propaganda, only today
They need someone known to hear
Manipulation is all to fear
Things were edging to the rise
See him laughing, the reason man
See him laughing, reason man
Everyone infected is paranoid
Old before the time
Blessed with the feeling we'll go grey
Shadow monsters will feed the flame
They're just calling, it's a rise
Now he's sending, the reason man
Now he's sending, reason man

I see you go again
to escape from the pain
shouldn't left you alone (no)
But baby listen to me
I can't help how I feel
theres an end of my love
You can run you can cry
but look deep in my eyes
our love must be through
I think I'm loosing it all
I don't want you to fall
so take my hand
and tell me were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
You went away from it all
couldnt take it no more
I fear you are gone
Would like to see you again
say I never walk away
but I know it's to late
(and I know it's to late)
You can run you can cry
but look deep in my eyes
our love must be through
I think I'm loosing it all
I don't want you to fall
so take my hand
and tell me were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
(wonder were you are)
Maybe you?r walking in my dreams
maybe I just wanna hold you
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
I wanna know were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
I need to know
(I really need to know who you are)
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you (i need you love)
I wonder were you are

Darlin' I can't explain, where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane and I know
I just need one more chance to prove my love to you
If you come back to me I guarantee that I'll never let you go.
can we go back to the days our love was strong.
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong.
Can somebody tell me how you get things back the way it used to be
Oh God give me the reason, I'm down on bended knees
I'll never walk again until you come back to me I'm down on bended knees.
Darlin' I can't explain, where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane and I know
I just need one more chance to prove my love to you
If you come back to me I guarantee that I'll never let you go.
can we go back to the days our love was strong.
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong.
Can somebody tell me how you get things back the way it used to be
Oh God give me the reason, I'm down on bended knees
I'll never walk again until you come back to me I'm down on bended knees.
Gonna swallow my pride, say I'm sorry,
stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life and I want it with you
If you feel the same don't ever let it go.
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It can heal all things we won't hurt anymore
No, I don't believe our loves terminal.
I'm down on my knees, begging you please come home.
Darlin' I can't explain, where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane and I know
I just need one more chance to prove my love to you
If you come back to me I guarantee that I'll never let you go.
can we go back to the days our love was strong.
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong.
Can somebody tell me how you get things back the way it used to be
Oh God give me the reason, I'm down on bended knees
I'll never walk again until you come back to me I'm down on bended knees.
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
seems like eternity
I'm begging yo, begging you, come back to me
Darlin' I can't explain, where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane and I know
I just need one more chance to prove my love to you
If you come back to me I guarantee that I'll never let you go.
can we go back to the days our love was strong.
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong.
Can somebody tell me how you get things back the way it used to be
Oh God give me the reason, I'm down on bended knees
I'll never walk again until you come back to me I'm down on bended knees.

[Elizabeth Gillies - Verse 1]
You made me insecure
Told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else
Na na na
Na na na
I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me
Na na na
Na na na
You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon
[Chorus]
Who says
Who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me
That's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful
Who says
[James Maslow - Verse 2]
It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It's like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky
Na na na
Na na na
I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me
Na na na
Na na na
You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon
[Chorus]
Who says
Who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me
That's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
Who says you're not beautiful
[Bridge]
Who says
Who says you're not start potential
Who says you're not presidential
Who says you can't be in movies
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test
Who says you can't be the best
Who said, who said
Won't you tell me who said that
Yeah, oh

Sometimes the way we talk isn't all that good
We can't change though we know we should
Baby, these fights we have aren't always fair
Was this problem always there
If I could, I'd change, I swear
I I could, I would, I swear

Dip my head
In the water
Feel my thoughts
Wash over me, over me
And I'm ready for disaster
I see you standing
Over me, over me
And I never meant to be the girl who broke your heart
I know I've been bad and did you wrong
And now I'm all alone
Never meant to be your stepping stone
So lay with me now I'll tell you how it went
All the thoughts that were running through my head
I'm a little bit overwhelmed
Forgive me if I try to ask you for help
I'm wrong
I'm wrong, wrong, wrong
And my body
Feels your anger
Like a fire
Burning deep burning deep
I've been foolish
Like a child
I hear them laughing
Over me, over me

I've been watching you
Wondering when you
When you goin' notice that
I've been looking, all the while
Just been hoping that maybe
I can get you right where I want you
I heard that you got a girl, but I can't sweat that none
'Cause when I see something I want, I get what I want
Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't
I gotta be up front (who knows)
And if I sound real blunt (hey)
It's only 'cause I'm the type to put my feelings on the line
Every time I see something I like
Your girl says she loves you but
I cannot pay attention to anything I hear from her
Boy you know she must not be
Trying to keep a hold on you while you're here with me
Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't
you're so fine
I want you to be the one
I call mine for sure
'Cause she's not right (no)
I ain't trying to be a hater or nothing,
But let me tell you something
She lost her game
So now I gotta do my thing
Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't

I Know she wants, I know she wants
I Know she wants, I know she wants
I Know she wants, I know she wants
I Know she wants, I know she wants
Boy I know you better
That you think you know yourself
I know where your coming from
Seeing you together
And I swear I can tell
There's somthing going on
I've seen her expression
as she looks in your direction
Its there in your eyes
You say there's no conection
You don' think that's her intention
Baby you must be blind
I know that she want you
She wants you, She wants you
I know it instinctivly
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you
She wants you, She wants you
You say your in love with me
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
Boy you think I'm crazy
You say she don't mean a thing
That I'm the one for you
She just wants your body baby
She don't give a damm
What I've been going through
She wants satisfaction
To be centre of attraction
I'ts clear to me
She needs no imitations
she's got such dertermination
Baby you still don't see
I know that she want you
She wants you, She wants you
I know it instinctivly
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you
She wants you, She wants you
You say your in love with me
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
You understand
You take my hand
You're proud to be my man
And I won't let you go
I've seen her expression
As she looks in your direction
Its there in your eyes
You say there's no conection
You don't think that's her intention
Baby you must be blind
I know that she want you
She wants you, She wants you
I know it instinctivly
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you
She wants you, She wants you
You say your in love with me
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
Repeat Chorus

WELL I SAW HER YESTERDAY
IT'S YOU SHE'S THINKING OF
AND SHE TOLD ME WHAT TO SAY
SHE SAYS SHE LOVES YOU
AND YOU KNOW THAT CAN'T BE BAD
SHE SAID SHE LOVES YOU
AND YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD BE GLAD (WWOOHHH)
SHE SAID YOU HURT HER SO
SHE ALMOST LOST HER MIND
BUT NOW SHE SAYS SHE KNOW

REPEAT REFRAIN
SHE LOVES YOU YEAH YEAH YEAH
SHE LOVES YOU YEAH YEAH YEAH
WITH A LOVE LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
SHE LOVES YOU YEAH...... YEAH..... YEAHH.......

You're flying loose and I'm losing ground with you
Want you to stay 'cause I can't follow you
You know I'll wait forever if you want me to
It's not your talkin' I know, it's who you're talking to
[Chorus:]
Missed you on Sunday 'cause you weren't there
Saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
Our number one day
Yeah I'm missing the answer to my prayers
I see you walking through the danger zone
That's not the way I used to walk you home
Don't want to hold you back
I'd let you go alone
And pray that someday you'll come back on your own
[Chorus]
Some people say I'm such a fool to wait for you
But I can't close the gates through the heaven we once knew
Life's such a mystery
Always been clear to me
When you're around I see the sun come shining through
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
Our number one day
Yeah I'm missing the answer to my...
I missed you on Sunday 'cause you weren't there
I saw you on Monday with purple hair
No matter what you do you'll find me there
Missing you on Sunday
Our number one day
Yeah I'm missing the answers to my prayers

Somebody said 'stop the music',
Somebody said 'Dim the lights',
Coz here comes what you'll never remember,
Here comes the night.
And I get so unholy,
And I am so uptight.
I need to believe, I want to believe
And I believe that I am were you are.
But it's the strangest thing,
And it's the strangest thing.
And I can't remember a thing about you,
But it's the strangest thing,
And it's the strangest thing.
I truly can't remember a thing about you.
You are my favourite ghost,
And you and I were the most,
But I can bring no justice, I can make no boast.
That you belong to me.
Set face your fears,
And stare through the tears.
I need to believe,
I want to believe,
And I believe that I am where you are.
And it's the strangest thing,
And it's the strangest thing.
And I can't remember a thing about you.
But it's the strangest thing,
And it's the strangest thing.
I truly can't remember a thing about you.
And I thought we'd never die (x4)
And it's the strangest thing,
And it's the strangest thing.
But now I can't remember a thing about you,

I want to wake up on the beach
Wake up with you by my side
We can smell the air with our blankets tight
You just tell me where
And I can take you there
Straight bro, livin' like billionaires
On the beach, wake up wave away the stars
I wanna watch the water trickle down your arm
You just tell me where
And I can take you there
With the top down, hands up, wind in your hair
Oh, you're my Lucy in the sky
There's diamonds in your eyes
We, we can be one love
We can be one light
Just for one day
We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day
Just for one day
Baby this could be a dream
The kind that make you smile all night
I'm the kinda girl, that makes your dreams real light
So tell me where you are
You know I'll send a car
A jet set, from your house, straight to the stars
Like a dream, colors of the best sunset
Color California, 'cause the coast is west
So tell me where you at
In 20 seconds flat
We'll be top down, hands up, never look back
Oh, you're my Lucy in the sky
There's diamonds in your eyes
We, we can be one love
We can be one light
Just for one day
We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day
Just for one day
Just for one day
One day we'll be underneath the stars
We'll be drinkin' champaign eatin' caviar
One day with you in the deep blue sea
'Cause its be me and you it be you and me
We, we can be one love
We can be one light
Just for one day
We, we can be one love
We can be one light
Just for one day
We could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
We, we can be one love
We can be one light
Just for one day
Just for one day
We could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day

I remember when
I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you
Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said
Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting
I'm waiting
Ooh, still waiting
I'm just a fool
Ooh, I'm a fool
To keep waiting
Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said:
Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting
Love has never shown his face
Since the day you walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for
Don't you know I'm waiting
I'm waiting for love
For you, I miss you
I'm waiting
Come on back, boy
I need you
I want you
That's what my friends says

Honey you were good for me
But I can't deny my need to be free grows
I resigned myself to climb the stairs to your
Winning thighs and endless prayers alone
My new-found confidence you hate,
Everything put down to fate
Nothing less or more
It's a marathon and not a sprint
That's what we said before we quit
Love should grow
Should boast
I feel I'm doing time
With someone not on my side
A mystery divide
Brings me close
To who I love the most
A friend from the capital came to visit
Will she comfort me or does she want to gossip
Who knows?
I'll take these troubles to the park
I won't come home until after dark
No one will know except you of course
I'll go swimming and ride a bike
Maybe turn into someone that you'd like
It's a marathon and not a sprint
That's what we said before we quit
Love should grow
Should boast

want to hear a comedy waltz tonight
A couple of beers and a comedy waltz tonight
Small minded people at the place where I work
There's small minded people all over the world
So I want to hear a comedy waltz tonight
Tell me a joke that brings tears to my eyes
Please tell me a joke so that I can laugh till I cry
I've heard the news and it's always the same
Never any laughs, just trouble again
So tell me a joke that brings tears to my eyes
There's something I can't quite put my finger on
About a clockwork monkey beating a drum
But any time I have seen such a thing
There's something inside of me knows what it means
I want to learn how to dance, I want to spin
There's something I can't quite put my finger on
About a clockwork monkey beating a drum
But any time I have seen such a thing
There's something inside of me knows what it means
I want to hear a comedy waltz tonight
A couple of beers and a comedy waltz tonight
Yes, I want to hear a comedy waltz tonight

Give me all your tears
Let me turn them into pearls
Let me turn all the tears
That you've cried into pearls
Hand them to me, I'm gonna keep
Keep them for you
I want to hold you,
I want to kiss you
I want to mend what is broken.
Love me the way that you loved her, please
Cause now I'm giving it all,
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be
Yours this time, I'm gonna give what I've got,
And get your love in return.
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be
Yours this time, I'm gonna teach you to trust
And learn how to burn,
Experience pearls
Pearls of experience
When sand strikes up in your eyes
I will cover your face.
I'll plant your desert with roses,
And I'm gonna keep, keep them for you.
And so I've made up my mind
I'll wear your pearls more precious than silver
I'll wear your pearls so close to my skin.
I'd tear myself apart just to get you,
And so I've made up my mind
And so I've made up my mind

Baby, when I lost you
My heart stood still
Oh baby, when I kissed you
Gave me such a thrill
Oh I'm far away from home
Oh baby, when I touched you
Felt a shiver on my skin
Baby, oh I love you
This love's not a sin
Oh I'm far away from home
I'm so alone
Far away from home
[Chorus]
Oh it's a fool's lullaby
Oh I never meant to make you cry
We can make a better life
Don't make my blue eyes lie
Oh it's a fool's lullaby
I gave you all
The best years of my life
Baby, take another chance
And give it one more try
Oh baby, if you call me
I'll he there
Whatever happens, baby
We just won't care
Oh I'm far away from home
Oh baby, take my heart
Let's heal the pain
Take me in your arms
Make love again
Oh I'm far away from home
I'm so alone
Far away from home
[Chorus]
Oh it's a fool's lullaby
I gave you all
The best years of my life
Baby, take another chance
And give it one more try

Spent three whole days, on cocaine
Haven't slept, awake, ain't eat a thing
But you've been on my mind this whole time
[Verse 1]
And one of these things that you told me
Is never forget, you'll never be lonely
And I know that, and I know now
Fact is...
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
You know this was never really about us
And everything was always 'bout you
You never knew a thing about trust
And I knew everything about you, what's happening
Three whole years, they can go by
In a blink of an eye, and you won't know it, but
What a damn waste of time
[Chorus] + [Bridge]
[Outro]
Tell you that you're doing it right when you're doing it wrong
You're doing it right when you're doing it wrong
I can't lie no more...
Yeah...


I'm just thinking about that time when I met you
But now I'm thinking about how I can forget you
You had my heart from the start but it faded
I needed space for someone else
I had to leave you just to realize that I miss you
Now I don't know what I did
I'm runnin' around baby
I'm runnin' around without you baby
I'm runnin' around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you
I am hoping that you try to forgive me
Maybe we can fall in love again completely
You had my heart don't you ever forget that
I'm coming back for it I promise you
I had to leave you just to realize that I need you
Now I'm changing, I can't take this
I'm runnin' around baby
I'm runnin' around without you baby
I'm runnin' around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you
Do you think that I could have one more try
I promise you that I will always stand by you
Cause I am through with
Cause nothing's as good if I am
Cause nothing's as good if I am
Runnin' around baby
I'm runnin' around without you baby
I'm runnin' around got my feet on the ground
And I'm missin' your face, I'm going insane
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you
I am runnin' around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you

The zombie femme from hell
I walk where money talks
My army dies to tell
Cry baby, cry
See Emily play
Kiss earth goodbye
Hello, judgment day
Boom, boom, bye-bye
The demons be gone
Bomb 'til you drop
A space marathon
The vultures feed
We're selling our souls
Big Money talks
Big Money controls
Enola Gay
Launch massive attack
Hurrah, hurrah
The army strikes back
Behold United Nations
Come hear my prophecy
Destroy civilization
Come join the mutiny
The gods of earth and heaven
The rich and infamous
The world implodes forever
Collapse the universe
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah
Nothing's gonna save us this time
We are going down
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah
Godzilla roars
Nations on parade
War end all wars
A nuclear cascade
Hailstorm immense
A crash and a bang
Nature's revenge
The last tiger fang
The vultures feed
We're selling our souls
Big Money talks
Big Money controls
Enola Gay
Launch massive attack
Hurrah, hurrah
The army strikes back
The hungry beast of horror
Six hundred sixty six
Let rockets build a cover
On my plutonium whigs
One hundred fallen angels
One thousand Babylons
The sound of bomb, alarm bells
And screaming electrons
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah
Nothing's gonna save us this time
We are going down
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah
I am the Amazon
A warrior in shades
I rule my dynasty
Your holiday in Hades
I am the Amazon
The zombie femme from hell
I walk where money talks
My army dies to tell
My army dies to tell
Hurrah
Hurrah, hurrah
Hurrah, hurrah
Cry baby, cry
See Emily play
Kiss earth goodbye
Hello, judgment day
Boom, boom, bye-bye
The demons be gone
Bomb 'til you drop
A space marathon
The vultures feed
We're selling our souls
Big Money talks
Big Money controls
Enola Gay
Launch massive attack
Hurrah, hurrah
The army strikes back
Destroy, destroy destruction
Until the bitter end
The final satisfaction
Construction time again
Beyond the war and sorrow
We break the holy seal
A brand new world tomorrow
A world of make believe
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah
Nothing's gonna save us this time
We are going down
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah

[Chorus: x 2]

It's 6.00am and even Big Ben
Is trying to get his head down for a kip
But no sooner is it down
And then it's on with dressing gown
For this city very rarely loses grip
But I have a friend who's never up by 10.00
He's fast asleep with mouth open wide
He's lost a lot of jobs, but he's won a lot of friends
And he says to me, he cannot tell the time
It's 7.00am and we're coughing up the phlegm
Spitting out the taste of night before
And we'll vomit and we'll choke
Just to climb their tatty rope
Well this city has its charm, and its claw
And he'll blame his clock
Or he'll say he's lost his socks
And they'll tell you that he's been bitten by a snake
His excuses are an art
From the bottom of his heart
And he thinks of them whenever he awakes
It's 8.00am we're on the road again
Racing for a placing at the top
And it says green for go
For the people in the know
But for the others all it says is red for stop
It's cold and its damp
And they've dug him a grave
And the 10.15 merchants still in bed
And scrawled upon the headboard
For the whole wide world to see
"Died In The Arms Of Big Ted"

I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
And I simply needed space
Space for me to be, and I think you need it too
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
I did this for you too,
You still got me around your finger
Even though I'm far away
Please, believe me when I say!
Everything I do,
I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make,
I only make for you!
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise, one day I'll come back for you
Oh, you say you hate me now,
And you burn me with your words
Callin' me a fool
Saying that I've fucked up
Everything, and you'll never forgive me
Though I'm doin' this for you
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Of loving someone so much that you need
To give them time to let them breathe
But you don't understand,
I wish you understood
Oh, I hope one day you do
Everything I do,
I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make,
I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise, one day I'll come back for you
Believe in you, believe in me
We're meant to be together
I told you weren't lyin', I know you aren't relyin'
And now I am supplyin' you the time and space
To let you grow into the person
That I know, that I know you could be
And I can be one too
And I'll come back to you,
And I am ready for you, baby I am ready for you now
I'm not ready for you now
Please don't hate me
Everything I do,
I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I'm gonna make for you!
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise, one day I'll come back for you
I promise, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day, I'll come back to you

So I'm to blame
The reason why you left him a mess and without a sigh
He was first I was next but enough to make you leave his side
But do you know? do you know what happens next? As he's torn apart left thinking she got
On a plane and their miles apart
Dug a little hole then she buried his heart
With the one she trusts, and their on the run
Tears fall like the rain
I feel a little bad when think of the pain
That you put him through
Am I such a fool such a fool?
Yea here we are, and every line I say seems to come out right on time
It's a first none the less just enough to keep you where you are
But will it change? Will I be the next one hurt?or the next one to complain that she got
On a plane and their miles apart Dug a little hole then she buried his heart
With the one she trusts, and their on the run
Tears fall like the rain
I feel it pretty bad when I think of the pain
That you put me through, am I'm such a fool? She'll move on, what is she waiting for?
She got on a plane and their miles apart Dug
a little hole then she buried his heart
With the one she trusts, and their on the run
Tears fall like the rain
I feel it pretty bad when I think of the pain
That you put me through, am I'm such a fool? So what am I waiting for?
Yea when she keeps running, she keeps running. She's moved on, she's moved on

It was a rainy night
A rainy night in New York city
Oh, she'll never fall in love, had enough of all
She was only 18, starring at the wall
She's my taxi girl - she was my baby
Through the stormy weather, through the stormy rain
She drove her little cab all over again
She's my taxi girl - she is my baby
Her only friend was Luca, she's working for the rent
But that guy was a hooker at the end
Oh baby, hey, be my taxi girl
Oh when you're alone - I'll be a part of you
Hey, be me taxi girl - I'll be your home
I'll make your dreams come true
Oh, she'll never love again, baby that is true
That's the answer just for me and you
She's my taxi girl - she was my baby
From the heart of Harlem to 5'th avenue
She drove her yellow cab like they all do
She's my taxi girl - she is my baby
Her only friend was Luca, she's working for the rent
But that guy was a hooker at the end

Well I don't really mind
Where you want to go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
Now it's a temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna be ok
Well it should come as no surprise
When you're dealing with the truth
It should be a state of mind
Or another point of view
So if your confidence is shaken
I can promise it won't break
You gotta show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna be ok
When nothing's making sense
And the questions never end
You gotta let it go
Every now and then
I can't pretend
But in the end I say that I don't know
And do you believe in miracles?
I hear they happen every day
And if you believe in them
We can walk on water
Well I don't really mind
Where you want to go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
It's a temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna be ok
Where you go
What you find
Will remain or pass us by
Some will climb
Some will fall
Some will rise above it all
Promises you make or break
Gone tomorrow, here today
Let it pass
Let it wait
Turn around and walk away
When nothings making sense
And the questions never end
You gotta let it go
Every now and then
I can't pretend
But in the end I say that I don't know
And do you believe in miracles?
I hear they happen every day
And if you believe in them
We can walk on water
Well I don't really mind
Where you want to go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
Now it's a temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna be okay

So many years have gone by
Always strong, tried not to cry
Never felt like I needed any man
To comfort me in life
But I'm all made up today
A veil upon my face
But no father stands beside me
To give this bride away
Well, I'm standing in the chapel
Wearing my white dress
I have waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Here I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
I've finally found the right man
Thoughts racing fast through my mind
As I'm gazing down the aisle
That my future will mend the memories
Torn between father and child
My emotions overload
'Cause there is no hand to hold
There's no shoulder here to lean on
I'm walking all on my own
Here I go
Now I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now, my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking that chance
You've shown me there's a right man
'Cause I never knew the right man
Well, I'm standing in the chapel
Ready to confess
That I've waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Now I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
Whoa
Well, I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now, my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance
And one day, my little girl
Will reach out her hand
She'll know I found the right man

Nothin goes as planned.
Everything will break.
People say goodbye.
In their own special way.
All that you rely on
And all that you can fake
Will leave you in the morning
But find you in the day
Oh you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
Oh you're all I taste
At night inside of my mouth
Oh you run away
Cause I am not what you found
Oh you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out.
Everything will change.
Nothin stays the same.
And nobody here's perfect.
Oh but everyone's to blame
All that you rely on
And all that you can save
Will leave you in the morning
And find you in the day
Oh you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
Oh you're all I taste
At night inside of my mouth
Oh you run away
Cause I am not what you found
Oh you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out.
No I cannot get you out.
I cannot get you.
Oh no I cannot get you out.
Oh I cannot get you.
Everything is dark.
It's more than you can take.
But you catch a glimpse of sun light.
Shinin, shinin down on your face.
Your face, oh your face.
Oh you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
Oh you're all I taste
At night inside of my mouth
Oh you run away
Cause I am not what you found
Oh you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
No I cannot get you out.
No I cannot get you out.
Oh no, I cannot get you

Somebody better call the law
We done took it outside we're about to brawl
Ol' boy done put his hands on a woman
Where I come from, son, the next thing comin' is a
Ass whoopin' in the parkin' lot
Gonna drop this fool right in front of the cops
Be proud of what I done
I ain't gonna run
Just read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I'll do my time and raise my right hand
I'll tell the judge, I'd do that shit again
I heard it through the grapevine
Good daddy and a husband is a doin' time
Said his wife and his kids were in the house
Ol' boy broke in man it all went south
When he dropped the hammer on his forty five
Now he's in the pen twenty five to life
Lord knows if it'd have been me
I'd have to say
Read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I'll do my time and raise my right hand
I'll tell the judge I'd do it again
If I have to put the law in my hands its about to break
Cause I know right from wrong and if you cross that line
Boy all I gotta say is
Read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I'll do my time raise my right hand
I'll tell the judge I'll do that shit again

What you gave me I know you gave me
You remind me all the time
And how you hurt me and you don't see it
Again I am the child
And though you tell me that you love me
I can't feel it and I'm afraid to let you down
It's all or nothing, I fear that something's wrong
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way
How I wish you, you suffered less too
It tears us both apart
And it's not pretty the way you criticize me
And how it breaks my heart
And though you tell me (though you tell me)
That you love me (that you love me)
I can't feel it (I can't feel it)
And I'm afraid to let you down
It's all or nothing, (it's all or nothing)
I fear that something's wrong
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way
How I wish you knew, how much I need you
I feel like running but I can't abandon you
You avoid my gaze, withdraw from me these days
You punish me for trying to be all that you wanted
What more can I do?
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail
(So tired of walking on, don't want to fail)
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way
I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail
And in order to please you I've abandoned myself
(In order to please you, I've abandoned myself)
And though it used to hurt me when you push me away
I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way, oh

There you were
Standing there
As your eyes reached out to me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart right then and there
All the love I never knew
I found in you
Suddenly
My world stood still
My life was then fulfilled
As you gently touched my hand
I knew that we had laying a plan
For everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last, oo
At last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life (when you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (a paradise)
It came today
Forever came today
As we were standing there
You didn't speak a single word
But your eyes
Your eyes said you wanted me
Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly
Darling, oo
My darling
Make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has led me
To this place to your warm embrace
And our happiness
Thanks to you my search has ended
And I want the world to see
How gently love has shined on me
With everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last, oo
At last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life (when you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (a paradise)
It came today
Forever came today
At last, oo
At last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life (when you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (a paradise)
Oh it came today
Forever came today
At last
At last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life

Oh, she's crying when I hold her
When the moon rises her photo
Oh, she's waiting - in the night Caruso sings
Oh, she's calling when I told her
Like the ocean touch the sand girl
I'll come back, babe
To the bed at the end of the world
She said, it is true - is it really true
I will wait for you
Baby, baby, baby
Une chambre pour la nuit
Is waiting for you and me
You're so good, you're so good
You're goody, you're goody
You're good to me
Une chambre pour la nuit
I love the way you love me
You're so good, you're so good
You're goody, you're goody
You're good to me
Oh, she's waiting, she's so lonely
She told me that I'm the only
Oh, she's waiting - in the light at the end of the world
She puts a candle in the window
That I'll find the way and I know
Oh, she's waiting
In the night Caruso sings
She said, it is true - is it really true
I will wait for you
Baby, baby, baby

Many times I have closed the show
Many times I have watched the crowd go
But in time, my father said
All these lessons learned
Many times I would paint this town
So many ways I would lose this crown
But inside, my mother said
All these lessons learned
We are born to make mistakes
And in turn hearts will break
Someone will have to mend the pieces of the puzzles that we make
But it won?t matter darling
'Cause tonight
We'll have the best night of our lives
Many times I have stormed the shores
Find a place I can call mine and yours
But in time, I've found
It was right before our eyes
We are ships across an ocean
Let out hearts out to the breeze
Never know when it was sinking 'cause we?re wasting everything
But it won't matter, darling
'Cause tonight
We'll have the best night of our lives
And even in my darkest hours
I'm sending out a flare for you tonight
Oh, tonight
And it won?t matter darling
'Cause tonight?
We are born to make mistakes
And in turn hearts will break
Someone will have to mend the pieces of the puzzles that we make
But it won?t matter darling
'Cause tonight
We'll have the best night of our lives
Best night of our lives
Best night of our lives

I shake my head and shiver
They smile and they stab my back
As they shake my hand
Send out an S.O.S. please
I'm marooned in monkeyland.
I'm idly staring at the sky
Did anybody hear me cry
A billion stars are a moving sight
To all you out there reading this tonight
It's just a trick of the light
I have to know what is real and what is illusion
Tell me how does it feel beyond this confusion?
Is there anyone there?
Do I dismiss this with a sigh?
And let the answers pass me by?
Is my creator God or a man?
Does someone somewhere care and understand?
It's just a trick of the light.
I have to know what is real and what is illusion
(Rest of chorus)
Is there anyone there?
Life's an optical illusion like other optical illusions
Beware

What can I do?
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure that
You're the apple of my eye girl
Fulfillment of my dreams
Time, will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or
Anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you
There to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I tell you I love you
But you won't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or
Anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you
There to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
Oh, that special love in us
Will all reveal in time
So let you're little heart lay down my body

Don't you say it's too early
Baby I don't wanna waste the day
When we've everything on our side
And nothing in our way
We can do what we wanna
'cause today the world is ours
Nothing gray, just real time and colour
In which to whittle away the hours
We could speak 'til nothing's left unspoken
We could drive 'til we've run out of road
We could drink 'til we've emptied the ocean
But I'd be happy here
Happy just to hold you
[Chorus]
'Til the suns and planets disappear
I could stay in your arms all year
Even if that means infinity through
If being productive is being with you
Then baby I don't want to waste another day
I'll shout aloud what I'm feeling
Let my tongue be still no more
Now I know that it's the real thing
Just try and keep me quiet about it
Oh...
'cause we could stare until we both are blinded
We could fall 'til gravity gets tired
We could lose our love just to re-find it
But I'm just happy here
Happy staying beside you
'Til the suns and planets disappear
I could stay in your arms all year
Even if that means infinity through
If being productive is being with you
Then baby I don't want to waste...
'Til the suns and planets disappear
I could stay in your arms all those years
Even if that means infinity through
If being productive is being with you
Then baby I don't want to waste another day

Ooh, la-la-la
Won't you share my world
Ooh, won't you share my world
Won't you share my world
Don't just stand around and say
I've made your life complete
And how I make you feel each day
Whenever our lips meet
You say you really love me so
Don't hesitate
To come and share my world
Please won't you share it
I gave you all the love I had
And gladly give you more
Love has found a way for us
To walk right through the door
And everlasting love
That's made for you and me
And it's reality
Can't you see
You've placed a seed love in me
And made it grow each day
And now it blooms a fruit of love for you
And if you really love me, yes, the way that I love you
Won't you please share my world
I want you
I need you to share my world
Share my world
Life can be so beautiful
I want you
I need you to share my world
Share my world
Baby, baby, won't you share my world, world
The sun puts on a smile for two
Every time we meet
And all that life has brought us through
It never will compete
With all the happiness we share together
If you share my world
Please won't you share my world
Please won't you share my world
I love you
I need you to share my world (Share my world)

'Cause in my heart (In my heart)
You play a very, very, very big part
So won't you share my world (I must share your world, baby)
Share it, share it, share it
Share, share
Share my world, babe

Share my world

From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet
My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me
Dearest one, I had a dream
I mouthed the words
The sound came out
I spoke to you in Japanese
Oh, my love I cannot see, I heard your name
I know at once there was no place I'd rather be
All at once there was no place that I would rather be
From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet
My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace,
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me
I packed my bag, I'm on my way
I am prepared for any season
I am prepared to stay
Here is my heart, my beating heart
Oh, how I'm longing for this love affair to start
How I'm longing for this love affair to finally start
From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet
My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me
From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet
My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace,
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me

Hi de ho, hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gotta find me some o' that old sweet roll
A singin' hi de hi de hi de hi de ho
I've been down so long
Bottom looked like up
Once I thought that second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Bein' taken by the ones
Who got the least amount to give
Hi de ho, hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gotta find me some o' that old sweet roll
A singin' hi de hi de hi de hi de ho
Once I met the devil
He was mighty slick
Tempted me with wordly goods
And said you could have your pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign
I said, Thank you very kindly
But Im in too great a need of mind
Hi de ho, hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gotta find me some o' that old sweet roll
A singin' hi de hi de hi de hi de ho

Got taken in
We feasted on olives from the fridge
We stood alone and we ate
We made love all afternoon
'Til the stars went gloom
You wrote, I laid, we dine, on oysters and champagne
That's what it seemed like
We connect in so many ways
So easy on my sake
Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?
Another rainy day,
We sat inside by the radiator watchin' old black & white films
Where everybody sang
You played in my solitude
You didn't get dressed 'til 2
New rain, says I, I wrote this song on my guitar
But it didn't turn out right
So we just connected in other ways
So easy on my sake
Why am I so shy around you?
Why am I so shy?
Why do I take care to astound you?
Why do I even try?
Why am I so shy around
Oh why am I so shy?
Why do I take care
Why do I even try?
Da di da... [Until fade]

Get down baby, Funky
I said get get get on down get on down Funky
I said get get get on down get on down
Never though the memories would cause us so much pain
When night time falls it brings the good times back again
With you and I, I can't deny the love that remains
We touch each other, in a special kind of way
The bittersweet parade we got will never end
So baby let's not pretend
That destiny has played it's hand
Can't stop the tide from flowing,
Can't hold back the pain
Can't fight the feeling,
It's like nothing stops the rain
Baby there's no denying
You've got what I crave
Got the hunger
It's like nothing stops the rain
We're trapped together, it's just something we can't explain
I'm your essential baby, you're my necessity
So let's agree that we do things in a different way
Opposites attract that's the way we'll always be
The bittersweet parade we got will never end
So baby let's not pretend
That destiny has played it's hand
Can't stop the tide from flowing,
Can't hold back the pain
Can't fight the feeling,
It's like nothing stops the rain
Baby there's no denying
You've got what I crave
Got the hunger
It's like nothing stops the rain
Want to get down tonight
Oh why'gonna get down tonight
Want to get down tonight
Oh why'gonna get down tonight
Nothing stops the rain
Nothing stops the rain

You need to fly away you little pest
Let me put this bitch in a coffin
Let me get my fly swat

People say that all I do
Is talk about you
But that's not true
I talk about you
Think about you
Dream about you
Can't live without you
It's just not true.
I can almost feel the sunshine
When black lucia led the white parade
Let me always be the one who's left behind
When they desert you.
She's not your blue eyed girl
No diamond calling
She's a darkened sky
A crystal light
When the day runs dry
And the rain is falling
Black lucia led me into night.
I never thought that I could ever be the same
Until I met you
I thought my time had been arranged
Times have changed
Since you came
I miss you
I can almost feel the sunshine
When black lucia led the white parade
Let me always be the one who's left behind
When they desert you.
She's not your blue eyed girl
No diamond calling
She's a darkened sky
A crystal light
When the day runs dry
And rain is falling
Black lucia lead me into night.

One. One perfect lie.
Was it told too soon?
And one, one perfect life
Turned to stone
Cold mercy
I kneel down by your grave
I kneel down torn and guilty
Did I let you down,
Say goodbye too soon?
And did you understand
My mistake?
Forgive me
I kneel down by your side
I kneel down scared and helpless
One perfect lie
Wrapped in kindness and tears
I wish I believed in your heaven
One perfect life
Led by blind faith and trust
If God has a heart he will find you
I'm torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty
I'm torn and guilty

There's a hand over my mouth
So I can't speak, speak to you
I'm tied, tied up in chains
And what remains is the silence
I feel the night around my days
As if the cold is here to stay
There are hands over my eyes
So I can't see what you're trying to do to me
I can't tell you what you want to know
I can't tell you all you need to hear
Cause there's no communication
I can't let you crawl inside my dreams
I can't tell you all my hopes and fears
Cause there's no communication here
There's no communication here
There's no communication here
There's no communication
There are tongues that twist and turn
That twist my words until I don't know them
You lie in black and white
And steal the night shackles me frozen
I call your name
But you're not there
I'm not insane
The water protect my heart and mind from you
I can't tell you what you want to know
I can't tell you all you need to hear
Cause there's no communication
I can't let you crawl inside my dreams
I can't tell you all my hopes and fears
Cause there's no communication here
There's no communication
There's no communication
There's no communication
There's no communication
I can't tell you what you want to know
I can't tell you all you need to hear
Cause there's no communication here
I can't tell you what you want to know
I can't tell you all you need to hear
Cause there's no communication
I can't let you crawl inside my dreams
I can't tell you all my hopes and fears
Cause there's no communication here
I can't tell you what you want to know
I can't tell you all you need to hear
Cause there's no communication here

Ay fond kiss, and then we sever;
Ay farewell, alas for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warrin' sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
Who shall say that fortune grieves him,
While the star of hope she leaves him:
Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me;
Dark despair around benights me.
Fare thee well, thou first and fairest!
Fare thee well, my best and dearest!
Thine be like, joy and treasure,
Peace, enjoyment, love and pleasure!
Had we never lov'd so kindly,
Had we never lov'd so blindly!
Nor never met nor never parted,
We would never be so broken-hearted.

I closed my eyes, a blind and cold-hearted fool,
Last night I lost my mind and came so close to losing you
So close to losing you
Misread your smile, misunderstood your tears,
Ignored the pleading voice and every sigh
Even your words of love I would not listen
It's a lesson I'll never forget
No communication gave rise to fear
Tell me, who's to blame
What I really meant to tell you I panicked,
'cause I would die if something happened to you
I'd die if something would
But I'm so spoilt by your patience and devotion
That only now I recognize some of my cruel ways
Some of my cruel ways
Maybe it's good, maybe it was meant to be
There was no other way you could get through
Now it's my turn to get through to you baby
It's a lesson I'll never forget
No communication gave rise to fear
Tell me, who's to blame
What I really meant to tell you, I need you
And I would die if something happened to you
I'd die if something would
What I really meant to tell you, I love you
And I would die if something happened to you
I'd die if something would
What I tried to tell you baby, what I tried to tell you darling
Could not live without you honey, would not live without you, no
If only you were with me baby, if only you were with me darling
'Cause I've been waiting for you honey, I've been waiting for you
I closed my eyes, a blind and cold-hearted fool,
Last night I lost my mind and came so close to losing you,
So close to losing you
So close to losing you

The first thought through my sleepy head
When I fell outta my bed is I hope the sky is gray
I'm gonna write a sad song today
So I make up my mind, slip on my shoes
I'm gonna pick up a paper and read the news
'Cause I'm sure to find enough blues to write my sad song
But when I open the door and the sun spills through
Takes away my breath and I think of you
And the only blues to hit my eyes
Are those beautiful blues in the clear blue sky
So much for my sad song
So much for my sorry attitude
Let's make this a love song instead
'Cause I'm so in love with you
Come on, let's go out and play
Save the sad song for another day
No time for tears, I'm wearing a smile
So much for my sad song
So much for my sad song
So I pick up the news like I said I would
Drop my jaw right where I stood
'Cause the headline reads, "All the news is good
Because love is on the way"
And love floods the world right before my eyes
Everybody is dancing and slapping hi fives
And such beautiful music fills the sky and we all sing along
And now I snap out of my daydream
And I can't believe how real it seems
But I keep on dancing anyway
It's turning out to be a beautiful day
Sometimes I measure my day
By how many things go my way
And when things go wrong I usually get mad
But this time I'm glad my song didn't turn out sad

I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through
And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

(Music & Lyrics: Doanlds, Gad)
Looking for something, it must be love
I don't expect nothing, in a world so tough
It was just like an adventure, between you and me
I feel like a stranger in my fantasy
Can nobody see me? I got an open heart
Won't somebody free me and tear my pain apart
I send my love out to this world
I dont wanna suffer so....
Send me a sign - nobody's perfect in this world
Send me a sign - I know your out there
Waving my name, send me a sign
When I'm telling to myself
I'm dreaming of you day and night
So send me a sign
Love is an emotion you wont forget

We pried open my window
Let the summer rush in
And we laughed with the new air
Now I lay and watch the green leaves
Dance and whisper sweet breath
A promise of a new year
On this day, we were born into the new year
And after the winter broke, we held hands and we ran
And we agreed that it had been a long one

The way you movin' got me ... tonight, tonight
So tell the DJ play my song, cause I love him,
I love him to this song
Tell the DJ play my song, cause you're leaving with me when it's done
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on tonight, on tonight, on
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on tonight, on tonight, on
There's nobody else I want you
So let me know whenever you ready to leave, to leave
Let me show you what I can do, there's you knew
Keep on dancing till the sunshine
Cause you'll be leaving with me when it's done
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on tonight, on tonight, on
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on
I got loving, I got loving
Baby you're turning me on tonight, on tonight, on
Baby... taking you home listen
When you whine up your body
Never seen you talk that much
You're not just a

I never liked you much
It's true
It's true
But forgive the hateful
Things I say and do
'Cause I do
The world is a mirror
And I see the things I hate
Every accusation that I dare to make
Here comes Princess Julia
Looking like a goddess
'Til she opens her mouth
Lola Hola is spinning round
Stella wants vodka
And she wants it now
Oh Mr. Strange
Oh Mr. Strange
Oh Mr. Strange
You're very weird
I never liked myself it's true
Well it's true
That's why I took my bitterness on you
Well I do
I look into the mirror
And I see the things I hate
Love to change the picture
But it's much too late
Here come Princess Julia
Looking like a goddess 'til she opens her mouth
Lola Hola is spinning round
Stella wants vodka
And she wants it now
Oh Mr. Strange
Oh Mr. Strange
Oh Mr. Strange
You're very weird
Sister Philip bitchin' on the telephone
Some handsome scary creature
Followed Missy home
It's a dangerous game you play
So hide those wedgewood plates today
'Cause all the love is take away
I know
I know
Told you this was lie
So very strange
Superstar strucked
Mr Strangeways
Strangeways
Oh Mr. Strange

Well our mamas they left us
And our daddies took a ride
And we walked out of the castle
And we held our head up high
Well we once were the Jesters
In your Kingdom by the sea
And now we're out to be the masters
For to set our spirits free, set free
We want to feel ya!
We don't mean to kill ya!
We come back to Heal ya, Janglin soul
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros
Well your wartime is funny
Your guns don't bother me
I said we're out to prove the truth of
The man from Galilee
Well your laws are for dummies, yes
Your institutions dead
I say we're out to blow the trumpet
To wake you all from bed, from bed
We want to feel ya!
We don't mean to kill ya!
We come back to heal ya, Janglin soul
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros
We carry the mail
We carry it home
We carry the mail now
We carry it home
Scare up your letters
Give us your tales
Blowing like whale now
To magnetic ears
Wow!
We want to feel ya!
We don't mean to kill ya!
We come back to heal ya, Janglin soul
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros

Isn't that my girl
And is that my best friend
Aren't they walking much too close together
And it don't look like they're talking about the weather
I must be seeing things I thought I'd never see
I must be hearing things when I hear her say to him
"I want you, I need you, I love you"
Looking through a tear
I can see him kissing her
And I feel my poor heart softly breaking
I'd do anything if only I was mistaken
I must be seeing things, oh no, it can't be true
I must be hearing things when I hear him say to her
"Forget him, it's over, you're mine now"

We're in trouble
In a mess I've got a feeling
That only you can stop it
Cos it's over if we say so
They still don't get it
That it's not an easy job
To be the one who says yes
When the whole world only says no
Will they ever believe this is only a dream
When will they scream
Yoko Ono
Break me open
Tell me which way
Do we go now
Yoko Ono
I've been hoping
To change this world
Before it's over
We're all choking on the fog and war
Help us, we adore you
Ohh, Yoko Ono
Ohh, Yoko Ono
They're still reeling
From the fact you keep stealing
Their alpha male rock star
It was mine that opened his heart
And in that moment he could fly
And his music was a jet
And you were the reason
Cos you made every (thought)
When will they realise that he only wanted to cry
When will they cry
Yoko Ono
Break me open
Tell me which way
Do we go now
Yoko Ono
I've been hoping
To change this world
Before it's over
We're all choking on the fog and war
Help us, we adore you
Ohh, Yoko Ono
Ohh, Yoko Ono
Ohh
Teach us how to cry
Teach us how to dream
Teach us how to die
Teach us how to scream
Teach us how to f*ck
Teach us how to pray
Teach us how to be
Man teach us
Yoko Ono
Break me open
Tell me which way
Do we go now
Yoko Ono
I've been hoping
To change this world
Before it's over
We're all choking on the fog and war
Sorry if we hurt you
We're reaching out for something more
Help us, we adore you
Oh, Yoko Ono
Oh, Yoko Ono
Oh, Yoko Ono
Oh, Yoko Ono

That Mississippi moon is full tonight
And there's a million stars in that Delta sky
The crickets and the bull frogs are singing loud
I've got an Elvis CD turned down low
Singing love me tender as I pull you close
I got a crazy thought, now hear me out
I got money in my pocket and a full tank of gas
I know a Chapel with a preacher
That can get it done real fast
Let's spin the wheel, roll the dice
We can make tonight the night
Are you in the mood for a little Vegas love
It's in the cards, it's in our hands
I know we got the perfect plan
You feel like a little, a little Vegas love
Vegas love, oh yeah
Oh you are looking at me like I lost my mind
But I am ready to get off the fence tonight
The water looks warm and I feel like jumping in
That you've been talking to me about tying the knot
The time is right and I know the spot
It won't surprise our family or friends
We don't need a lot of money
Cause we got a lot of love
I'm not afraid to lay it all on the line, I'm betting all on us
Let's spin the wheel, roll the dice
We can make tonight the night
Are you in the mood for a little Vegas love
It's in the cards, it's in our hands
I know we got the perfect plan
You feel like a little, a little Vegas love
Well your mama's gonna cry and your daddy might be mad
But only till he figures out how he saved all that cash
Let's spin the wheel, roll the dice
We can make tonight the night
Are you in the mood for a little Vegas love
It's in the cards, it's in our hands
I know we got the perfect plan
You feel like a little, a little Vegas love

Once there was a boy who left the bed he slept in
And he ran away 'cause he felt life was cruel
A killer of fools was walking close behind him
The boy was afraid that he'd be thought a fool
Oh the fool killer is a giant they say
He chops down a fool and he goes on his way
Better runaway boy was a runaway boy
Very much like you
So, he claimed the hills and roamed the woods and valleys
Just get up and go became his golden rule
A killer of fools was walking in the shadows
The boy was afraid that he'd be thought a fool
Then there came a day a man and woman found him
Lovingly they smiled and then they called him son
No more did he fear that wicked old fool killer
I know that it's true because I was the one
Oh the fool killer is a giant they say
He chops down a fool and he goes on his way
Well who was the fool tell me the boy in his bed
Or the boy who used to roam
Runaway boy listen, runaway boy better go on home
