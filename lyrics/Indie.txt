the last thing i heard
was you're coming back
and Italy's love scene
was going black
the city of love
was pulling you in
with 200 miles
between me, you, and him
you got me good
it's understood
you got me good
yeah, i understand
you got me good
it's understood how
you got me good
september 6
back in '94
i watched you walk
til i could see you no more
out of the airport
all of my love
in the form of a
16-year old girl
you got me good
it's understood
you got me good
yeah, i understand
you got me good
it's understood how
you got me good
talking to my brother yesterday,
he said
that your new boyfriend
didn't seem that bad
long blonde hair
pushed gently back
the kind that i had
when you used to love me
hey you can't push away
the sun and stars that way
you can't push away
the changing of the day
you can't push away
the sun and stars that wait....

I just flew in
From the windy city
The windy city is mighty pretty
But they ain't got what we got
No sir'ree
They've got private lawns and public parks
Well they've got those menstrual shows
Pretty ladies with the big shot bows
They've got private lawns and private parks
I just flew in
From the the windy city
The windy city is mighty pretty
But they ain't got what we got
No sir'ree
They've got private lawns and public parks
They've got private lawns and public parks
They've got private lawns and public parks

European Girl
Take off your coat
European Girl
I still want your soul
Don't be scared of the world
The world outside your window
I'll take your picture, and later of you're free
I'll drink your coffee, flick through your TV
See the smoke fill up your streets from your balcony
Every night you wonder why the galleries have hung you out to dry?
European Girl
Take off your coat
Don't be scared of the world
The world outside your window
No matter how, no matter how you work it out
No matter how far you have to fly
You'll be on my mind
I will be dreaming of a European Girl
If I might be so bold
Take your time, I'll take off your coat
I beg your pardon, we're moving the wheels
It's hard to be the children of someone else's revolution
Better world harder and harder, then
You're going to make it for a thousand years
European Girl
I won't be going anywhere, European Girl
(She don't need no chaperone, no she don't need no god)

Broken love don't pay my bills, uh, huh, huh
Broken love gives me the chills, uh, huh, huh
Broken love don't follow signs, uh, huh, huh
Broken love rolls with these times, uh, huh, huh
It ain't no good to cut and run
Or suicide from a smokin' gun
I loved her, she loved me
Broken love is killin' me
Broken love's got broken wings, uh, huh, huh
Broken love cries when it sings, uh, huh, huh
Money comes as money will
I'd be a dead man if looks could kill
If you're in poverty or a millionaire
Broken love is everywhere
Broken love will do me in, uh, huh, huh
Broken love should be a sin, uh, huh, huh
Broken love will break my bones, uh, huh, huh
It don't need no old sticks and stones, uh, huh, huh
I was blind I could not see
Fruit was falling from the apple tree
I loved her now she is free
Broken love is gonna bury me
Broken love, broken love, broken love
Broken love, broken love, broken love
Broken love, broken love don't pay my bills

Early in the morning I was still in bed
You call me just in time when the sunlight comes
You said "How was your sleep? I didn't do too well. Would you be a friend and take a walk with me?"
My friends they all been telling me that you're no good
You broke a lot of hearts and you don't even know
I refuse to believe any of that is true
But I'll hate it when they're right and tell me told you so
I don't want to be a victim of a broken heart
I don't want to put myself into another mess yeah
I don't want to be a fool and make a big mistake
I've should've known better, but it's allright
Cause I'm in to you
Early in the morning I was still in bed
We've talked about an hour till my ear turns red
You said "It's getting late, I'm gonna have to go. I'll be getting ready so how 'bout that walk?"
My friends been telling me that I should let you go
You broke a lot of hearts and then you run away
I refuse to believe any of that it's true
But I'll hate it when they're right and tell me told you so
I don't want to be a victim of a broken heart
I don't want to put myself into another mess no
I don't want to be a fool and make a big mistake
I've should've known better, but it's alright
Cause I'm in to you
Early in the morning I was still in bed
The thought of you remains the biggest mystery
I was left unsure of all this thing would go
I guess I'll think about it when I walk with you

I wish I had one last try
Hidden somewhere inside
But it's all been spend before
When I reach for it I can sense it in my hand
And when I try to grasp it
It's like sand, or water
Through my hopeful fingers
This just won't hold, hold
This just won't hold, hold
There's something so half-full about us
We get so little but what we get it tastes so much
We're always longing for more
Is this the end of the thread?
The thread that led me to lose my head
Over something that started with wonder
This just won't hold, hold, hold, hold
And even if a butterfly lives a hundred years
Or the stream of water turns around in the rivers
You and me, we'll still be the same
You and me, you and me, you and me...
We'll be the same

MRS JOHNSTONE
ONCE I HAD A HUSBAND
YOU KNOW THE SORT OF CHAP,
I MET HIM AT A DANCE
AND HOW HE CAME ON WITH THE CHAT
TEDDY BOY
Y' DANCIN'. I THINK YOU'RE A BLEEDIN' CRACKER.
MRS JOHNSTONE
HE SAID MY EYES WERE DEEP BLUE POOLS
MY SKIN AS SOFT AS SNOW
TEDDY BOY
LOVELY.
MRS JOHNSTONE
HE TOLD ME I WAS SEXIER THAN MARILYN MONROE
AND WE WENT DANCING
WE WENT DANCING.
THEN, OF COURSE, I FOUND
THAT I WAS SIX WEEKS OVERDUE.
TEDDY BOY
Y' WHAT !??
MRS JOHNSTONE
WE GOT MARRIED AT THE REGISTRY
AN' THEN WE HAD A "DO".
GUESTS
BRING ON THE BEVVIES.
MRS JOHNSTONE
WE ALL HAD CURLY SALMON SANDWICHES
AN' HOW THE ALE DID FLOW.
GUESTS
CHEERS.
MRS JOHNSTONE
THEY SAID THE BRIDE WAS LOVELIER THAN MARILYN MONROE
GUESTS
AND WE WENT DANCING,
YES, WE WENT DANCING.
MRS JOHNSTONE
THEN THE BABY CAME ALONG
WE CALLED HIM
TEDDY BOY
DARREN WAYNE.
MRS JOHNSTONE
THEN THREE MONTHS ON I FOUND THAT I WAS IN THE CLUB AGAIN.
TEDDY BOY
I MARRIED A BLEEDIN' RABBIT.
MRS JOHNSTONE
AN' THOUGH I STILL FANCIED DANCING
MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T GO.
TEDDY BOY
GET LOST WILL Y'.
MRS JOHNSTONE
WITH A WIFE HE SAID WAS TWICE THE SIZE OF MARILYN MONROE
NO MORE DANCING
NO MORE DANCING.
BY THE TIME I WAS TWENTY-FIVE
I LOOKED LIKE FORTY-TWO.
WITH SEVEN HUNGRY MOUTHS TO FEED
AND ONE MORE NEARLY DUE
ME HUSBAND, HE WALKED OUT ON ME
A MONTH OR TWO AGO
TEDDY BOY
TA-RA.
MRS JOHNSTONE
FOR A GIRL THEY SAY WHO LOOKS A BIT LIKE MARILYN MONROE
AND THEY GO DANCING
THEY GO DANCING
YES, THEY GO DANCING
THEY GO DANCING.

We could pretend that we're walking on petals and light, golden light
Flaunting our love like a dance step mastered, turning from left to right
But after all the colored lights are gone
Time will leave the ashes and the dawn
You rise and meet the day
I'm watching you go, it's like spying on hope ever onward with more to burn
Giving your hands and your heart to the weave of the world, though it fights each turn
But you do not give up so easily
That's how I know you won't surrender me
You rise and meet the day
It's all I need, it's all I need to know, it's all I need to know
And I love you all the time
I had always feared that some gloomy ingratitude would seize me
But you have held the dream like every morning finds
A way to hang the sun up in the sky
And now I think I have it too
The greatest part I learned from you
You rise and meet the day
And I can see kids, maybe yours, maybe not, oh oh oh,
I can hear what they'll say
Laughing at pictures with the old-fashioned hats
And the clothes that we're wearing today
And they will know the true and humble power
Of love that made it through the darkest hour
You rise and meet the day
It's all I need, it's all I need to know, it's all I need to know

I don't know why
why you had to leave me
and i don't know why
you said goodbye
only if i try
can i feel the earth beneath me
and as days go by
i come alive
the fall of your hair
the feel of your skin
and the smile on your face
as you took me in
now i lie
and stare at the sky
still i wonder why
i don't know why
you said that you'd release me
no matter how i try
i still feel you
i watched a falling leaf
drifting down towards me
carried by the wind
it disappeared
i sat in disbelief
at what had become of me
and as the day grew dark
i rose to go
and as i walked along
i thought i heard you call me
alas i was alone
so i went home
the fall of your hair
the feel of your skin
and the smile on your face
as you took me in
now i lie
no longer cry
but still i wonder why
i don't know why
you were taken from me
i cannot forget
or say goodbye

Oh, fill her up to the top
Well, I got nowhere else to be
Oh, today, yeah, I woke up
And the whole world was there for me
The hard time comes around
But they can't get me down
'Cause I'm way past caring
Oh, nobody tells me what to do
Oh girl, I cried my last for you
There's not a soul I answer to
No one?s put out when I misbehave
Or if I don't come home for days
Well, I've got nothing to explain
So you give me the same again
To the top
Well, there's no easy way to say
I'm not okay and I'm drained away
A little further every day
The last time comes around
And I just can't make it out
And I'm way past caring
Nobody tells me what to do
Oh, did it mean a thing to you?
There's not a soul I answer to
No one?s put out when I misbehave
Or if I don't come home for days
Well, I've got nothing to explain
Come on, just give me the same again
'Cause I'm way past caring
Oh, nobody tells me what to do
Oh girl, I cried my last for you
There's not a soul I answer to
No one?s put out when I misbehave
Or if I don't come home for days
Well, I got nothing to explain
Come on, just give me the same again

Take one more step and it's over
Back up slowly in sight
Breathe too loud and I'll kill you
Get down on your knees and beg me beg me beg
Beg me beg me beg
Take off all of your clothes
Lie face down on the bed
Move one inch and I'll shoot you
Make like a woman and beg me beg me beg
I said beg me beg me beg
Every night on TV
I see things that should make me blush
Looks like it's gonna be
Another open season open season on us
Open season open season on us
It's the first hot day of the summer
Looks like there's gonna be thunder
I've been sitting here all afternoon
Watching the clouds

I remember the day the day
When I had to take you to the airport
And put you on a plane
And so you left me
Left me alone on an empty tube train
Deep under the ground
While you were bathed in sunlight
High above the clouds
I needed you here
To be my sunshine in London town
California's had more than its fair share
You left me to these small skies
And to rain-soaked concrete
To Morrissey and Robert Smith
And complicated streets I know
On which you lost your patience and your way
The way you always did on steel gray rainy days
I needed you here
To be my sunshine in London town
California's had more than its fair share
Of beating summer sun and shining seas
But it doesn't have a shred of honesty
I know the truth, yeah, Neil Young
And Joni Mitchell were Canadians
I guess that makes sense, they had their fill
And then they moved away again
You're not alone, we all sometimes
Use words that we don't understand
Your love was only just skin deep
And in the end it gave me cancer
You might have been my sunshine
But I'd rather have a rainy day
California gets just what it deserves

When I am laid in earth
I'm laid in earth
May my wrongs create
No trouble
No trouble
In thy breast
Remember me
Remember me
But ah
Forget my fate
Remember me
Remember me
But ah
Forget my fate

Well we're heading for a past that you leave not defend
Where the downtowns hold the sadness of you can't go back again
It's there you'll find the rust and debtors
Motel signs with missing letters
Cause there's a monster on the outskirts
Says it knows what your town needs
Then it eats it up like nothing and it won't spit out the seeds
And we can be the super shoppers
We can say we're really smart
We can say our town is doing fine without a beating heart
We can even say the money saved is all our own
It's bought and sold, it's bought and sold
And we're heading for a nasty business, keeps our country growing
Where the weapons that we're selling are the only seeds we're sowing
You get to blow the fruits of all your labors
Sell F-16's to all the neighbors
And we know that it's for money
And that's how the west gets bargained
You the know the last time this happened
Even Vietnam got jargoned
And you can say they're out to hunt you
You can say they're out to fish you
You can join a gang of restless boys
Or start your own militia
You can even say your violence is all your own
It's bought and sold, it's bought and sold
Well I look up to the people who are less bought than I
You can show them what you're selling
And they'll only ask you why
And their paychecks don't have lots of zeros
They're my friends and they're my heroes
And the TV sets are angry 'cause they just can't make 'em pay
But I like the way these people read the signs and walk away
And we can call ourselves the makers
And the keepers of the times
We can spend our sand dollars
And sand nickels and sand dimes
We can even say prosperity is all our own
It's bought and sold, it's bought and sold
We can even say our loneliness is all our own
It's bought and sold, it's bought and sold
It's bought and sold, it's bought and sold

What about my hamster hamster in law
From the roots deep down my family tree
Grows my branch and music sets me free

My friend you left me in the end
I can't believe I'm writing a song
Where friend rhymes with end
But today
I must cave in
I have trouble forgetting those beautiful eyes
As it is
I must fill your space with lies
Friend
You left me in the end
I guess I knew it all along
I guess I expected this song
And it is as it appeared
Like a fist in my stomach and
Swallowing tears
Your song turned out a sad one
Just as I feared

Oh my ghost came by
Said who do you love the most
Who you wanna call before you die
Oh my ghost came by here
Said who do you love the most
Who you gonna sing to 'fore you're gone
Oh hey heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh hey, heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh my ghost came by here
Said who do you love the most
Who you gonna sing to 'fore you go
Oh hey heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh hey, heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh if you're there
When the world comes to gather me in
Oh if you're there
I will be blessed
Oh if you're there
When the world comes to gather me in
Oh if you're there
I will be blessed
Oh if you're there
When the world comes to gather me in
I hear you're there
I will be blessed
I will be blessed
Oh if you're there
When the world comes to gather me in
Oh if you're there
I will be blessed
I will be blessed

She never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City
The cold comes though every crack she puts her hand up to
The radiator's broken, so she has to use electric heat.
And tonight was the first date with the brother of the guy she worked next to
He lived a couple streets away
He listened, he had things to say
She asked him up for dinner sometime
Sometime was tonight
The radio gave updates on the ice storm while she made the dinner
They said, from all the talk, you shouldn't drive or even walk
And this just in, we're asking everyone to turn off their power
They need it at the hospital.
She ran around pulling plugs, then she called him up
Maybe now they shouldn't meet, he said that he would brave the streets
She met him at the door with a blanket and a candle
Saying, I heard it on the radio, I had to turn my power off.
He said you're not the only one, the streets were dark tonight,
It was like another century
With dim lamps and candles lighting up the icy trees and the clouds and a covered moon.
She said what kind of people make a city
Where you can't see the sky and you can't feel the ground?
I tell you something, I have this feeling that this city's dying
He said, it's not dying it's the people who are dying
She said, yes, yes I think the people are dying and nobody cares.
We had all this technology our dreams were bold and vague
And then one city got bad planners, one city got the plague.
He asked why did you move here? She said, for the job
For the job and I've been so lonely here, so lonely
There's no one I can talk to, you know I don't even know your brother.
He smiled and said, sometimes at night I walk out by the river
The city's one big town, the water turns it upside down
People found this city because they love other people
They want their secretaries, they want their power lunches.
And think about tonight, I heard the same newscast you did
I unplugged everything, I looked out the window
And I think the city heard, I watched as one by one the lights went off
So they could give their power to the hospital
They ate in silence while she thought this over,
They sat together in a dark room in the Mortal City
Shifting in their blankets so they wouldn't get spaghetti on them.
Then came the awkward moment after dinner, what to do,
The ice was still falling, the streets were still dangerous
The cabs were not running and this neighborhood was not the greatest.
They both looked at the space where a couch would've been
She felt her stomach sink, she felt like she could hardly think
She said, I never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City
The cold comes through eve crack I put my hand up to
The radiator doesn't work, I have to use electric heat.
That settled it, they would both sleep in her bed
It was a matter of survival.
She brought out t-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, socks, hats
If there was ever any thought of what would happen in that bed tonight
There was no question now
They could barely move
They were wrapped up like ornaments waiting for another season.
They lay in bed, they listened to the pelting ice
He said my brother's not a bad guy, he's just quiet
I wished you liked this city
She said, maybe I do.
I think I have a special kind of hearing tonight
I hear the neighbors upstairs
I hear my heart beating
I hear one thousand hearts beating at the hospital
And one thousand hearts by their bedsides waiting
Saying that's my love in the white gown,
We are not lost in the Mortal City
We are not lost in the Mortal City

Sing yourself to sleep
Because I don't know your name
To the ocean we will go
If the land won't stop us first
So kiss yourself for life
From the threats you can't bend
Oh, of all the things we have done
It doesn't seem good enough
So we sing at the source that we love
We were young and we don't know your name
Do you ever sit and stare?
The quickening of time
Is there something else for us?
Or a line we'll never cross

How to get to fivepoints?
Make the wrong turn, you'll know
If you're thinking of going
Think no more
Who's taking you down there?
What's his name, let me know
The price he offers
Round the corner of love
Halfway to fivepoints
Is as far as you'll come
Halfway with high hopes of love
So be careful, my love
Be careful, my girl
Be careful with love
How to get to fivepoints?
How would I know?
A place so distant
And so long ago
Halfway to fivepoint
Is as far as you'll come
Halfway with high hopes of love

Separate the sparkle from the stars and put them both on trial.
"order in the court!", the judge pukes up a putrid smile.
Tear the tingle from the touch
And lock them both in a windowless cell.
The D.A. fingers the jury like the snail fucks the shell.
Clik clik bang bang
Kiss the siamese gun
Clik clik bang bang bang.
exhibit A: the trail of the womb tears the blinking genitalia.
exhibit B: a death leather towel to mop the blood and saliva.
Every smile is evidence,
And lifting a proud tentacle his honor howls your sentence
"death to the accused the scum the human menace."
exhibit C: your journal sewn with pony hair and claws.
exhibit D: your cancerous smiles our equations can't solve,
Those teeth can't be tamed they can't be proven,
Load the siamese gun shoot shoot shoot it!
sterilize the black widow of it's web silk,
Drain piano island of it's pineapple milk.
Pave the sea, divorce the fish from the fin.
The gavel pounds...the audience hisses for skin.
Order yeah! order yeah! order in the court!
Let the execution begin...
The executioner's thighs widen like a grin let the execution begin.
And in a flash every face twists electric octopus,
Hungry, anxious for pain.
Clik clik bang bang kiss
The siamese gun...
exhibit E: you're on your knees.
Choking on the barrel of the siamese gun!

I never had a friend as close as you
So close to my heart
I dropped everything when you came through
So close to my heart
And I put my pens and my paint box aside
Oh so close to my heart
And the river that ran down the rock face dried
Oh so close to my heart
When you were close to my heart
It was an honor that you ran so free
So close to my heart
I thought I'd lost something forever, silly me
So close to my heart
But the place you hid in as bare as it seems
So close to my heart
It held my will in its infinite dreams
So close to my heart
When you were close to my heart
So now you're gone and now we'll both find our ways
So close to our hearts
By the forge that leaves a stamp on each day
So close to our hearts
And we'll long to make great things in our lives
So close to our hearts
And we'll wonder if what we make survives
Oh to the beat of the heart
It's the work of the heart
But you were close to my heart

Won't you take me home,
I will follow through.
I can fell your arms,
bent and bound in two.
Won't you take me home,
home to what I knew.
You can hear my heart,
hard and sold by you.
We'll save again, hold the last chance,
for all, anyone will love again.
Alone alone, say you're unknown,
By us anymore. By I.
Won't you take me home,
I will follow through.
I can see your heart,
Pounding out anew.
When you take me home,
home to what we knew.
You can hear my heart,
Hard and sold to you.
We'll save again, hold the last chance,
for all, anyone will love again.
Alone alone, say you're unknown,
By us anymore. By I.
We'll save again, hold the last chance,
for all, anyone will love again.
Alone alone, say you're unknown,
By us anymore. By I.

you walked me home late that night
and you laid a kiss on my hand
say goodbye
and though it's been a long, long time
since the night we walked our separate ways
you're on my mind
and I've been here before
I've walked this floor
and I already know we're collapsing
and I kept you near, and I kept you distant
but the more I did, the more I failed
I was wrong
but there are things I have to deal with
in my own specific puzzled way
and I'll be fine
and it's a simple rule to keep in your mind
that nothing ever changes but you
time will never be on your side

Well I've been here before
I've sat on the floor
In a gray gray room
Where I stay in all day
I don't eat but I play
With this gray gray food
Desole, if someone is prayin'
Then I might break out
Desole, even if I scream,
I can't scream that loud
I'm all alone again
Crawling back home again
Just stuck by the phone again
Yeah, well I've been here before
Sat on a floor
In a gray gray mood
Where I stay up all night
And all that I write
Is a gray gray tune
So pray for me child, just for a while
And I might break out
Pray for me child, even a smile
Would do for now
So I'm all alone again
Crawling back home again
Just stuck by the phone again
Have I still got you to be my open door?
Have I still got you to be my sandy shore?
Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm?
Have I still got you to keep me warm?
'Cause if I squeeze my grape
And I drink my wine
'Cause if I squeeze my grape
And I drink my wine
Oh cause nothing is lost
This is frozen in frost
And it's opening time
And there's no one in line
But I've still got me to be your open door
I've still got me to be your sandy shore
I've still got me to cross your bridge in this storm
And I've still got me to keep you warm
Warmer than warm yeah
Warmer than warm yeah
Warmer than warm yeah
Warmer than warm yeah...

We stopped for coffee in the redwood forest
Giant dripping leaves, spoons of powdered cream
I wanted to kiss you, but I wasn't sure how
Like those Indians lost in the rain forest
Forced to drag burning wood wherever they went
They had had all forgotten how to light a fire
That's why people OD on pills
And jump from the golden gate bridge
Anything to feel weightless again
Those poor lost Indians when the white men found them
Most died of TB, the rest went insane
In our motel room you were drinking slice and gin
Reading Moby Dick on the other bed
Remember the first time we slept together
You said it felt like when you learn to float
That's why people OD on pills
And jump from the golden gate bridge
Anything to feel weightless again

The moon has blocked the sun
That I haven't seen for days
It walks the street as the chimneys burn
I?ll drink some beer as to find my way
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
The streets were made for horse and cart
They talk to mine behind close doors
Stood in the rain to feel the part
This maze I stand of concrete walls
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
Suspicious corpse without a face
The screen light?s a hidden dim
This black hawk can't find its place
Through the night we swim
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home

God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.
You can't just keep waltzing out of my life,
Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,
Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.
You should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.
You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,
With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,
When I thought that suffering was something profound,
That weighed down on wise heads,
And not just something to be avoided,
Something normal people dread.
God dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.
With all the things I've done and the places I've been
I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.
But you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.
You're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.
You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,
That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,
Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:
The tell-tale signs of being used,
Of being trapped inside of you.
You're a beautiful butterfly
Burned with a branding iron
Onto my outsides into my insides
As a simple sign:
To show off your ownership.
Burned into my naked skin,
Onto my outsides into my insides.
It's not even love any more,
It's just a claim upon my soul.
It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,
And I'm ashamed to get undressed
In front of strangers in case they see
The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.
God dammit Amy.
You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.
And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -
I just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.
But these tell tale signs are here to stay, and in the end you know that's OK.
You will always be a part of my patched-up patchwork taped-up tape-deck heart.

They're biting at your heels
Country lanes lead to fields
Who was that fox caught in that trap?
Laid with hunters map
When the cloud rolls back, back, back
I'll meet you at the mill
Depressions in your neck
He's just keeping you in check
Who was that fox caught in that trap?
Laid with hunters map
When the cloud rolls back, back, back
I'll meet you by the mill

Girl, I'm gonna take the month of August off
Just to get you off
I'm freaky
I'm gonna clear the table top
We're gonna need a mop
I'm freaky
Let's take a photo of a goat in a boat
And then we can float in a moat and be freaky
Freak-ay
Let's take my body and we'll cover it with honey
Stick some money to the honey
Now I'm covered in money, honey
I go outside onto the ledge and push my ass against the glass
You can act like you don't know me
I'll take a cup and then I'll put it on my head
And I'll just stand there bein' freaky with a cup on my head
I told you I was freaky (I told you I was freaky, baby)
You didn't believe me (Don't look at me)
I told you I was freaky (Hey look at me)
Girl, let's get freaky
Let's make two life size cardboard cut outs of our bodies
And then pose them into sensual positions
I'll paint the wallpaper pattern onto your naked skin
Stand against the wallpaper and get up like chameleons
I flip some clips on my lips
I clip some chips to your hips
I nibble chips off your hips
And watch the moon eclipse
I'll go outside and get some leaves and pretend to be a tree
You can be a squirrel and store my nuts for me
I told you I was freaky (He told you he was freaky, baby)
You didn't believe me (Take that off)
I told you I was freaky (Put this on)
Girl, I do this shit weekly
Let's steal my roommate's pillow feathers
And make some homemade wings
Gonna fly so high with makeshift pillow wings
Girl, can you believe we're flyin' with homemade pillow wings
Ahhh
Oww ow
Oww ow oww
I told you I was freaky, baby
I told you I was freaky, baby

Some people say that rappers don't have feelings
We have feelings. (We have feelings)
Some people say that we are not rappers. (We're rappers.)
That hurts our feelings.
(Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers.)
Some people say that rappers are invincible
We're vincible. (We're vincible.)
What you are about to hear are true stories
(Real experiences)
Autobiographical raps.
Things that happened to us, all true
Bring the rhyme!
I make a meal for my friends,
Try to make it delicious,
Try to keep it nutritious,
Create wonderful dishes.
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
Nobody compliments the meal
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I feel like a prize asshole
No one even mentions my casserole.
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
You coulda said something nice about my profiteroles
Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye,
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive,
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs,
And the assistant suggested I try a ladies' size
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit I'm a man!
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
Get me a small man's wetsuit, please
It's my birthday, 2003
Waitin' for a call from my family
They forgot about me
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, Mum
I call my friends and say, "Let's go into town"
But they're all too busy to go into town
So I go by myself, I go into town
Then I see all my friends, they're all in town
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
They're all lined up to watch that movie
"Maid in Manhattan."
Have you even been told that your ass is too big?
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?
Have you ever been told you've got a weird-shaped head?
Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away?
Once again, they forgot about J
Were you ever called "homo" 'cause at school you took drama?
Have you ever been told that you look like a llama?
Tears of a rapper
(don't wanna make a rapper cry then watch what you say)
I'm crying tears of a rapper
(I pouring out the bullets of my Icannon)
Go play the tears of a rapper
(These are the tears of a rapper now)
The diamond tears of a rapper
(These are the bullet proof 24 karat of tears, of a rapper)

Oh, oh, oh
Love of mine
Won't you lay by my side
And rest your weary eyes
Before we're out of time
Give me one last kiss
For soon, such distance
Will stretch between our lips
Now the day's losing light
Oh, oh, oh
Bring me your love, tonight
Bring me your love, tonight
Lost at sea
My heartbeat is growing weak
Hoping you'd hear my plea
And come save my life
As the storm grew fierce
An angel was certainly near
I knew there was nothing to fear
Bring me your love, tonight
Bring me your love, tonight
No, I am not where I belong
Bring me your love, tonight
No, I am not where I belong
So shine a light and guide me home
No, I am not where I belong
So shine a light, guide me back home
Oh, oh, oh

Burned out like all
Cathie candles
Marked up with the
Choir vandals
Reading, "destroy, destroy, destroy"
Two-speed cycle
Streamered handles
Evenings with the
Roman Scandals
I just want to be someone you know

Who's gone, buried in the well?
Who's gone, buried in the well?
Nobody knew him, he had only arrived.
Who's gonna break it to his wife?
Who's gonna break it to his wife?
She died giving birth to her fifth and final one...
Who's gonna rescue all his sons?
Who's gonna rescue all his sons?
Bears heavy burden, but you could give them away...
Who's got a home for them to stay?
You can't sell the children, but there's hell to be payed.
And I'm not giving these orphans away...
So, I'll get no more sleep at night,
I'll get no more sleep at night,
I'll no longer dream...
Who's gone, swallowed by the sea?
Who's gone, swallowed by the sea?
She was only twenty, but she f*cked like thirty three.
Who's gonna round up all her things?
Who's gonna round up all her things?
Nobody liked her, but they loved when she'd sing.
Who's got a bell for us to ring?
We won't make a sound until her body's in the ground...
And I'm admitting the voice sounded strange...
Said, "You'll get no more sleep at night.
You'll no longer sleep at night.
You'll no longer dream."
[x3]
You won't get no sleep...

Whatever it is spit it into a bottle and sell it to me
I'm looking to buy freedom from my sobriety
Just like Huey Lewis
I need a new drug, I need a new drink
I need a new drug that does what it should
So take me to the bank
Take me to the bar
Can you take me to the hot spot?
This is what we worked so hard to afford but
Take me to the bank
Can you take me to the bar?
Can you take me to the hot spot?
This is what we worked so hard to afford but
How I wanna hide
The next time you visit me here
How about coming out to my place
We can sit on the floor and play my brother?s records
We can sit on the grownup bed
Couple with the coin
Lighting up to join the coping crowd
My big brother said to stay unsatisfied
Never work a day to pay off your desire
Couple with the coin
Lighting up to join the coping crowd

If you close your eyes, do you
See any sky?
If you close your eyes, can you
Make out any skies?
Is there a sky
When that knot,
That knot unties?
As you close your eyes.
When you close your eyes, will you step
Into the skies?
As you close your eyes, do you step
Into the skies?
Is there a sky
When that knot,
That knot unties?
As you close your eyes.
When you close your eyes, I will resist
I will not cry.
When you close your eyes, I can't resist
I will not cry.
I will not try,
To know why.
To know why.
But all things stop, die, die, die.

Semilla
Owl eyes unwinding
Asia and all your little diamonds
All your little diamonds
Everybody that's inside me
Buries the body that's behind me
The body that's behind me

I never thought you were the letter writing type
So now I see the words you chose the way you write
So I started to write back about the trees in the snow
And I saw a bird, couldn't see what it was but I thought you'd know
You always surprised me
And if I wrote You
If I wrote You
You would know me
And you would not write me again
And when the spring came and flooded all the streams
It's like how you got the night you told me all your dreams
And when the barn roof sagged after an icy bout
It's like how you got when you knew the truth was the only way out
But not the only way
And if I wrote you
If I wrote you
You would know me
And you would not write me again
We drew our arms around the bastard sons
We never would drink to the chosen ones
Well you know the way I left was not the way I planned
But I thought the world needed love and a steady hand
So I'm steady now
And I'm so happy
I had to tell you
And I love you
And you will not write me again
You will not write me again
You will not write me again

VERSE I
Enter sadness, with his rainboots in blue
Since I can remember I've been runnin' from you
But this time you sat your ass down with no intent to move
You ain't no Blue Healer
VERSE II
Well the longer that you sit here lookin' into my eyes
The shock of your arrival, it begins to subside
And as I drop my defenses you start to crack a smile
Are you a Blue Healer?
CHORUS I
Well I've been proud and
Lookin' in a mirror that's clouded
With smoke keeping me shrouded
Believing I'm fine
But you wipe clean
All of these illusions that ain't me
Now you've got me lookin' and I hate me
Where is my spine?
VERSE III
Peace, you told me, I'm only here to reveal
Where you've been stuck and where you're going if you're lookin' to heal
But you've gotta drop these vain addictions and hang on to what's real
You Healer
BRIDGE
I want to welcome every shadow
Instead of taking every one to battle
I'm climbing back up into the saddle
(2x)
CHORUS II
And now I stand tall
Used to think my sorrow was a brick wall
Made me want to curl up in a tight ball
Self-pity dealer
But there's a gate here
You can only find it if you wait here
Now I'm walkin' through it with my gaze clear
Me and the Blue Healer

Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Then I pulled out in a day
To catch my breath some place far away
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
Tomorrow morning set me free
For many nights you'll never sleep
When I'm far from reaching out of sight
Enough to get me on my high tonight
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Farewell for now, farewell for now, farewellâ?¦
All to say no one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I do

Send me now, the winter's over
A light turns out, the winds are colder
The love we've had will turn all over
Going south and we are older
On the one tightrope you walked down
On a night like this you all turn around
No but I, I won't hold you anymore
No and I, I can't have you anymore
And some days we're all alone
On the banks of the rhine
And some days all we had
The salt in the sea
?
And some days we're all alone
On the banks of the rhine

The lines are on board, it's quiet offshore
But the wind blows
The children are here but the women just stare
From the windows
See the lawns outside, groomed green lawns
Oh how they glow
And I spotted you there with curlers in hair
On the telephone
And I, longed for you.
Yes I, long for you.
Oh I'll move for you.
Yes, I'll move for you
Years spent round on the foyer
As the maid sweeps dust
And leaves from the back door
My heart could be yours
Within dreams we're free
But you'd always ask for more.
So I'll move for you
Yes, I'll move for you
Oh I'll move for you.
Oh I'll move for you.

My ships are frozen sticks
They lay stuck to the floor
My wrists and my breasts are bleeding bricks
They don't float anymore
And my tongure, it's a carbine scrolled
Doesn't run anymore
And my friends are all useless lense
They don't see anymore
And all my chicks are all useless hens
They don't lay anymore
And my fists are plastic dice
They're the shape of the sun
Yeah
And my love is a so long song
Gone forever more
And I like where I
Yeah, I love where I
And I like where I live

Im going round, Im going down
To my friend's house to get myself high
It takes me to a different place
Where nothing leaves my mind
But the men in blue knocked on my door
He said Ive come to kill off your kind
Its the killing of the mind
The circus came then packed up their things
When theres no one around
Well be high as kings, without the things
Like jewels and gold
Im rolling down, Im rolling down to my hotel
Between the lines
The paperboy still looks the same
As the old get old and the young are feeling fine
A soldier came, knocked on my wall
He said Ive come to kill off your kind
Its the killing of the mind
The circus came then packed up their things
When theres no one around
Well be high as kings, without the things
Like jewels and gold
The circus came then packed up their things
When theres no one around
Well be high as kings, without the things
Like jewels and gold

I'm down by the wishing well,
wishing you well.
I've been anticipating your return my girl
So come sit,
take a trip with me
on this here grass.
Deep inside my pocket I have
special gifts for us.
And we make dandelion wine amongst other gifts
for the cost of a kiss.
Come sit with us, take a trip.
And we go...
I'm down by the wishing well,
wishing you well.
I've been anticipating your return my girl
So come sit,
so come trip with me in my "oh".
Deep inside my pocket I have
special gifts for us.
And we made dandelion wine...
Mmm...

Last night was the science-fiction
Movie with you and me
You in your velvet space-helmet
Me in my rainball hat
If you'd write my lines
I would gladly play father-time on your tv-show
You got the wilderniss lipstick
And I got the penmarking
You are great, yeah you're a star
Someday everyone will know
Who you are
Everyone will know
Who I am
It's morning in heaven, again
LA is lost in the clouds
So I sings goodbye skylines
And I will sadly sing you off to our next episode
I'll make the most of my time, machine
And I'll build the fare I'm in
You'll be great, you'll be a star
Someday everyone will know
Who you are
Everyone will know
Who I am
Everyone will know
Who they are
May you climb high
Into the sky
May ratings rise
Once I learn these lines
I will madly sing lullabies
Into the unborn fans
You write the bible and I'll
Read it off my eyelids
And we'll be great, yeah we'll go far
Someday everyone will know
Who you are
Everyone will know
Who I am
Everyone will know
Who they are
Who you are
Everyone will know
Who I am
Everyone will know
Who they are
Last night was the science-fiction
Movie with you and me
You in your velvet space-helmet
Me in my rainball hat

A desert sunrise, you warm my soul
Painting me in shades of clay
Covering me whole
And I'm a lizard, sunbathing in your radiance
Oh i come out of hiding, so sweet
so sweet you are
If I could only have a taste
Wrap my lips around your flavor
Just because you are you
Just because you are, so beautiful
And I've been waiting all this life
In the company of one
And I know I am young
But I don't want to be alone
If you could only just
Consider the two of us
And i know darling
I could be so good to you
I see you rising
On the horizon
Bringing light into the day
And I'm coasting on your rays
When I awoke, you spoke through the mist of the mystic bliss
Casting shadows
On all my dismal yesterdays
Do you remember that you told me, darling
That I was so real
I tell you all, my tears for you are real
And we'll cross that bridge again some day
I know we will
I hope we will
Desert sunset, a lullaby
If I could give it all to you
If you'd only let me try
Sing so sweetly, it's my only wish
Music drips from your lips like sweet sips of a summer's kiss
Summer raindrops are precious, tongues twist
And I've been waiting all this life
In the company of one
And I know I am young
But I don't want to be alone
If you could only just
Consider the two of us
And I know darling
I could be so good to you
I see you rising, on the horizon
Bringing light into the day
And I'm coasting on your rays
When I awoke and you spoke through the mist of a mystic bliss
Casting shadows
On all my dismal yesterdays
Do you remember that you told me, darling
That I was so real
I tell you all, my tears for you are real
We'll cross that bridge again some day
I know we will
I hope we will
Desert moonrise, into the night
Before we lay our heads
I wish to walk under the splendorous starlight
Sing so sweetly, it's the sweetest sound
And I've become weak in the knees
And I drop down and kiss the ground
And all my cares lie far below
In this earth I wish to die
In this hearth my fire grows

I don't know what to do
In this world of pride
I'm feeling used
You, you left me this way
And in my heart I can't erase
The loving of her way
I don't realize what she means to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what you're trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on
Now will my heart feel complete?
Either way I avoid complete defeat
You, you can't hurt me this way
And in my heart I can't erase
The madness of my life
I don't realize what you mean to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what I'm trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on
She never understood
She never understood
She never understood
I don't realize what she means to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what she's trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what she means to me
Even though we're meant to carry on
I don't realize what I'm trying to say
Even though we're meant to carry on
She never understood

How did we lose this great right
Everything burns in our past
The balance we broke
Left us running through smoke
You're at the blue light of the flame
As the earth melted the poles
I raise to mend the controls
And I work harder, fiercer and smarter
You are at the blue light of the flame
So this is where it all ends
With the flowers by your belt
And your friends come to you
As the light turns to dark
But the light shines through
Yes when the hurricanes came
We were the gods that we blame
We have all injured file
We feel our desire
You kneel at the blue light of the flame
Happy on rescue
Somebody left you
Looking to the blue light of the flame

What am I going to do
I am crying a bottle of wine over you
This is something I don't usually do
But I'm crying a bottle of wine over you
For me it is red or nothing
Hey ho my lover will go
And this will ruin everything
Hey ho my lover will go
I'm just too romantic
Hey ho my lover will go
Without any sense of strategies
Hey ho my lover will go, oh oh
Twelve days and many long nights have passed
Since I let go of my heart way to fast
Too many long summer nights
I've been checking for errors on the telephone lines
For me it is red or nothing
Hey ho my lover will go
And this will ruin everything
Hey ho my lover will go
I'm just too romantic
Hey ho my lover will go
Without any sense of strategies
Hey ho my lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh
What am I gonna do
I am pouring my heart all over you
I guess I recognize this too
I think I'm falling in love with you
For me it is red or nothing
Hey ho my lover will go
And this will ruin everything
Hey ho my lover will go
I'm just too romantic
Hey ho my lover will go
Without any sense of strategies
Hey ho my lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh

I had a dream I met a girl,
With brunette curls and nature faults,
She didn't seem to care (not) all like me,
Like holding hands and falling backwards on your knees.
And man I loved her like it hurt,
When being buried I'd prefer she be the dirt.
She didn't seem to care (not) all like me
Baby it's coming out,
The burns, sunburns,
The burns, sun.
The sun is coming out,
The burns, sunburns,
The burns, sun.
Falling backwards
Falling backwards
Falling backwards
Falling backwards
Like burning bottles, burning props,
I learned to love her and accept her flaws.
She didn't seem to care (not) all like me,
Like holding hands and jumping fearless in the stream.
The day she taught me how to run,
To hold my breath and give my body to the sun.
She didn't seem to care (not) all, so what
Baby it's coming out,
The burns, sunburns, the burns, sun.
The sun is coming out,
The burns, sunburns,
The burns, sun.
All the lights, all around
All the lights, all around
All the lights, all around
All the lights, all around
Baby it's coming out,
The burns, sunburns, The burns, sun.
The sun is coming out,
The burns, sunburns,
The burns, sun.
You know I'd love you till it hurts.
(All the lights, all around)
You know I'd love you till it hurts.
(All the lights, all around)
You know I'd love you till it hurts.
(All the lights, all around)
You know I'd love you till it hurts.
(All the lights, all around)

The summer child is running, the summer child is running again.
The summer child is running, the summer child is running again
When you hear the feet and the sound of laughter,
Better step aside for the mayhem after
Here she comes, yeah the summer child is running again.
It's the stormy season, lighting flashes through the air
And the water bugs are busy spinning backwards in the rain.
The summer child is running, summer child is running again
The summer child is running, summer child is running again
And they're spinning out like old tin tops
One of them is down and all time stops,
Now she's up yeah the summer child is running again.
Come my freezing daughter, brave the icy water
Enter slowly under cherry blossoms,
Racing as you see the gates of summer.
There is time and time to come, underneath the golden sun,
And forever will melt slowly in a glass of lemonade.
And oh she's coming running, and oh she's coming running again,
The summer child is running, the summer child is running again.
Better have a seat, 'cause you won't run past her.
Try to take it in, every year she's faster.
Here she comes, yeah the summer child is running again.
The sun is shining and the summer child is running again.

I walk
Back through what I have known
Seams sewn but they still show
Now we're slowly finding our way
And this
New road that we've made
Let it help us to mean what we say
Stand by you I will
Stand by you I will
Let the old house burn
To stem and stern
We love
Sometimes we learn
But we're just living now
Yeah we're just living now
I know
We all must move from our side
You're all that I wanted to find
Stand by you I will
Stand by you I will

We don't ask for much
Just what was promised us
We don't want the world
Just a house and a little girl
Why I moved to France
Nothing here was built to last
What you want and what you chose
You can't have both
You can't have both
I've been dreaming of dropping out
Will it matter if I'm around?
If you want to tell me now
I've been dreaming of dropping out
All we need is light
What's mine is yours and yours is mine
And we got it right
No one taught us how to fight
What you want and what you chose
You can't have both
You can't have both
I've been dreaming of dropping out
Will it matter if I'm around?
If you're scared to tell me now
I've been dreaming of dropping out
We'll grow our hair
Cut our ties
Grow our hair
Cut our ties
Grow our hair
Cut our ties
Grow our hair

A-nother day goes by, it goes by.
Still I am far away
From your side, from your side.
And Oh my heart, how it aches sometimes
It aches sometimes
And though we're apart
I've got you on my mind.
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
You're on my mind.
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
You're on my mind.
The end of this road
You'll never know, you'll never know.
And all that we have
We'll never hold, we'll never hold
And somedays I, just can't seem to find
Seem to find
A single way
To get you off my mind.
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
You're on my mind.
You're on my mind
You're on my mind,
And one day when all this travelling has ceased
I will lay my head and rest my feet
Dream of all the days when we were young and free
When I had you
When I had you with me
When I had you with me, yeah.
When I had you with me.

Well I held you like a lover
Happy hands, your elbow in the appropriate place
And we ignored our others
Happy plans for that delicate look upon your face
Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows what we have done
Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?
Well you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands
And my foot in the appropriate place
We use cushions to cover happy glands
In the mild issue of our disgrace
Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the lighthearted
In the boon that beats our drum
Well I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has accidental babies
For we are in love
Do you come
Together ever with him?
Is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?
What about me?

Her eyes are like the sunrise.
Her voice is like a summer breeze
When it's ninety-eight degrees outside,
It's refreshing.
She could be the best thing that's ever happened to me.
But she's so far away.
Somehow I'll find a way.
She's so far away from me,
But she visits each night in my dreams.

O cruel other
Mark my word I say
In the a.m. I am long gone, an AM wave
This is all you will know of my face
I'm done with Atom Age
And early DJs
Who I leave here in the dusk
I'd guess you're turning up so fine there before our sun
Where the angel strumpets open up
The perfect figures wade {& weighed}
In on the shape of the atom made
My dear mother
don't you lay wake
fix on the river flowing only for heaven's sake
this is all just a chemical change
A return to native states
{See major changes
in an ocean around each man
my undoing will be by my own hand
wave after wave I am winding up the sand
where my babies play}
the fresh fallen atom made

They call it night,
they call it night
and I know it well

A lonely burden rests gently
This is harder than I thought
Your face is distant and paler now
It's funny how things work out
But if I keep a constant speed
And watch everything rush past me
It's the quickest way to leave it all behind
Only it never leaves
I'm beginning to forget, I'm beginning to forget you
I just see an outline
I'm beginning to forget, I'm beginning to forget you
I hope that's alright
I miss your kitchen window view
The effect I had on you
Your voice is lost in static waves
Erased by every day
If I keep a constant speed
And let everything rush past me
This bloody mess I can leave behind
Only it never leaves
I'm beginning to forget
I'm beginning to forget you
I just see an outline of you
I'm beginning to forget
I'm beginning to forget you
I hope that's alright
I'm beginning to forget
I'm beginning to forget you
I just see an outline
I'm beginning to forget
I'm beginning to forget you
I hope that's alright
I just see an outline
I just see an outline of you
(Just see an outline)
I just see an outline of you

And every soldier's face is burnt,
And it's a mask of withered flesh.
And their hands have turned to rifles now,
And they kill everything and anything that they touch.
So watch the trees swaying in the breeze,
Keeping beat to the butchery.
And every subway station's wrecked,
It shuts down and off.
And business men in a panic:
"Here they come! Here they come!"
And they collect power killing love.
So watch the bat,
A picnic death camp.
Keeping beat to the butchery.
So children come burn the skyscrapers
And the cities alive,
Come clean within you.
And the metronome clicks like new,
And the metronome clicks over our skulls.
And every single window pane is smashed,
And every cop is smiling broken glass.
Here's a place where the soldiers came,
To rake up all that they could take.
So toss another bottle,
Pull another pin.
Light up the sky in a butchery.
So children come burn the skyscrapers
And the cities alive,
Come clean within you.
And the metronome clicks like new,
And the metronome clicks over our skulls.

I broke in
To your house again today
And I laid in your room
And it was pretty but it's sad
'Cause it was all inside my head
I don't know what's real or dreaming anymore
It's harder than it looks sometimes
To stand up straight and look you in the eyes
And believe in all your fucked up lies
'Cause it's your world I live inside
It's your world I live inside
Bury me
Inside the doll house in your bedroom
And carve your name into my arm
And quietly
You'll fall asleep
And abandon me
But I take it; I'm ready
It's harder than it looks sometimes
To stand up straight and look you in the eyes
And believe in all your fucked up lies
'Cause it's your world I live inside
It's your world I live inside

I caught a glimpse out the window
A Polish graveyard filled with widows
I coddle a bottle of warm beer
I see a pool of liquid tears
Glimmering so sweet and mellow
A sea of lilting wilting willow
A secret book of forgotten wishes
Drown in ponds with broken dishes
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
Angel brother I miss your hair
Careless nature gentle stare
You fell like rain in the dark abysses
Kissed the lips of bloody twinsis
Sung to you a slew of sirens
Tricky mermaids and evil pirates
You watched the sky
With kaleidoscopic eyes
Howling out right
To the blasphemous night
A wolf in the garden
Why do you linger so
Like a silky snail soul
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know
The moon asked the crow
For a little show
In the hazy milk of twilight
No one had to know

Well we're all half-crazy
And half clear as a bell
Half believer, half goin' to hell
Half goin' to hell
Half goin' to hell
Well we're all half Rama
And half Bonnie and Clyde
Half devoted, half buried alive
Half buried alive
Half buried alive
Shine
On the one you love
Holy pony
Lord, Lord, Lord, what have I done
A cloud of hornets blackened the sun
Blackened the sun
Blackened the sun

Hover through the foggy vapours,
Until I see you in a dream,
Singing animals to sleep...
By the way, it's over without you.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
Lights out to midnight.
Sleep all day
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Sha la la la)
Dark and quiet, only the owls are watching,
Only the sky is up and I'm leaving for a place
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
From Another time, just to be near you, just to be near you, just to be near you
(sha la la la la la la la la..)
I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
I'm in the way, I'm in the way...
Don't become the one you hated.
Death is absolutely safe, billion bibles mark the last page.
I've gotta move through the days without you here
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal
I've gotta move through the weeks without you here
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal
I've gotta move through the months without you here
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal
I've gotta move through the weeks without you here,
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal
I've gotta move through the weeks without you here
I get a shock, shock hurts to heal
Shock, shock hurts to heal
Hurts to heal
Hurts to heal
Hurts to heal

I'm swallowing flies,
And lullabies,
Won't you listen?
I'm severing ties,
And polishing lies,
'till they glisten.
What do you take me for?
A pawn or a king?
A future or present?
What do you keep me for?
All manner of things 'till I learn my lesson.
'Till I learn.
Our paths are entwined,
So laugh in disguise,
Go the distance.
I'm far from unkind,
So darling of mine,
Won't you listen?
What do you take me for?
A pawn or a king?
A future or present?
What do you keep me for?
All manner of things 'till I learn my lesson.
'Till I learn.
If you and I settle our differences,
I think you'll find a way to come back to me.
If you and I settle our differences,
I think you'll find a way to come back to me.
A way to come back to me.
A way to come back to me
What do you take me for?
A pawn or a king?
A future or present?
What do you keep me for?
All manner of things 'till I learn my lesson.
What do you take me for?

Sunday morning I'm confined
But the last time I could understand
What's left in me? I don't know
But I wanted to be there tonight
Holding on I fall
I discovered you in the mess of things
When silence was my only friend
Watch the sky turn red as I look into your eyes you're gone
Days go by too quickly to fast I can't count
And I'll reach for you my love but I'm confined to my suffering
Seems so far away but I want to be there tonight
Holding on I fall
Days go by too quickly too fast I can't count
And I'll reach for you my love but I'm confined to my suffering

1, 2, 3, 4
I'd like to sing to you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sing to you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sing, sing, sing, sing, sing to you
Alone
And I'd like to dance with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to dance with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance with you
Alone
I'd like to sleep with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sleep with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep with you
Alone

Carousels twirl all around exited youth.
I do not mind
At all.
We're tonight in a world full of thrills it can (come) carry me up,
Far above
It all.
It's a long way down
From here
To the sound.
Watch the faces
Go 'round
To the stars
Then the ground.
Ferris wheels carried us away
Not so long ago.
Times I've betrayed.
Where would we be now if I had taken your hand?
Well the years they pass by slow
Don't they?
It's a long way down
From here
To the sound.
Watch the faces
Go 'round
To the stars
Then the ground.

He told me himself
He's a gentle soul
And I saw for myself
He's a gentle soul
Camilla's a calming name
Like windowing
Camilla's a calming name
Like windowing
There's nobody else
With your babe's little eyes
This is number fourteen
Out of how many tries
Your voice has a calming strain
All whispering
Well my voice wants to do the same
Oh brothering
All alone in your zoo
Of numbers and clues
Of colors and hues
He told me himself
He's a gentle soul

A woman is a female who is human,
Designed for pleasing man, the human male.
A human male is pleased by many women,
And all the rest you hear is fairy tale.
Then tell me how this fairy tale began, sir.
You cannot call it just a poet's trick
Explain to me why many men are faithful
And true to one wife only.
They are sick!
A girl must be like a blossom
With honey for just one man.
A man must be like honey bee
And gather all he can.

When I heard the news, my heart fell on the floor
I was on a plane on my way to Baltimore
In these troubled times it's hard enough as it is
My soul has known a better life than this
I wondered how so many could be in so much pain
While others don't seem to feel a thing
Then I curse my wiseness and I get so damned depressed
In a world of suffering, why should I be so blessed?
I heard about a woman who lives in Colorado
She built a monument of sorts behind her garage door
Where everyday she prays for all whom are born
And all whose souls have passed on
Sometimes my trouble gets so thick
I can't see how I'm gonna get through it
But then I would rather be stuck up in a tree
Than be tied to it
I know
There is so much more
I don't feel comfortable with the way my clothes fit
I can't get used to my body's limits
I got some fancy shoes to try and kick away these blues
They cost a lot of money but they aren't worth a thing
I wanna free my feet from the broken glass and concrete
I need to get out of this city
Lay upon the ground and stare a hole in the sky
Wondering where I go when I die, when I die

It's getting late
I think my time is running out
No one special
Nothing lasting with inside
How should I stay calm
When panic lies just ahead?
Everyone can see my youth
Hanging by a thread
No subtle men
Came to my town
No subtle men
Begging for my hand
I'm one of few who's left
When everyone has gone
The train is leaving
And it's too late to get on
So much for running
When no one stays to wait
For another broken promise
To slip my mind by mistake
Who would take my word
On anything these days?
I felt so many times
Saying I'm gonna change
No subtle men
Came to my town
No subtle men
No lifelong friend
Lives in my town
No subtle men
Begging for my hand

What is it that happens to me when you're around?
I try to bring some love I'm just bringing it down
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
I try to say something And nothing comes out
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
A broken voice
In a broken door
A broken choice
That I broke some more
A broken me
Am I breaking you?
And if I push you too hard
I push you right through
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
You call to my door
But I don't come out
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
It seems like my words tremble
Like a creaking ground
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
A broken voice
In a broken door
A broken choice
That I broke some more
A broken me
Am I breaking you?
And if I push you too hard
I push you right through
A broken voice
In a broken door
A broken choice
That I broke some more
A broken me
Am I breaking you?
And if I push you too hard
I push you right through
What is it that happens to me when you're around?
What is it that happens to me when you're around?

Go on and tell them all your lies
I saw you touch her in her sleep
And it was no surprise
You're burning papers in the field
I'm downtown trying to push myself to steal.
But that's the way it goes.
You came and met me in the street
We stole a car
Got high and went to sleep
And dreamt we were the people that we want to be
And when i met you, you were sweet
But now you're out sucking dick
Haven't slept in a week
But don't come crying to me.

there are no lyrics to "Team"; it is a purely instrumental song.

Summer comes
To multiply,
To multiply!
Summer comes
To multiply,
To multiply!
And I...
I'm the Carnival of Peace
I'll probably start a fleet
With no apologies
And the Carnival of Scenes...
It grows more and more appealing
But my woman and I...
My woman and I know what we're for
Summer comes
To multiply,
To multiply!
Summer comes
To multiply,
To multiply!

Now that I know
The way it goes
You gotta pay back every penny that you owe
twelve years old
In your mama's clothes
Shut the blinds and lock up every door
and if you hear
Someone coming near
Just close your eyes and make them disappear now
Years away
Finds me here today
On my own and knowless of my way now
So I send my friends
Gifts from where I've been
Something for the hand that's never there to lend
better keep those eyes
Climbing paradise
And don't pretend you won't reach it in the end now
dearest dear
I know you been here
Why'd you run tell me why'd you disappear now
that you're now
Here with me
Seems to be the only time I can see you clearly
I may not know
How to treat or give you what you need
But I am a gentleman who says what he means now
And now I sing
Upon my knees
And praise the kind ?gives us? a gentle breeze
I'd see that swell
Like a story in me to tell
Told years away and past my baby dying
so you raise them up
To heaven or ways to hell
They're unaware share to give a hand to help some

I fill your pillow case up with snakes
The man eating kind
Though you call your self a woman
I doubt it they would mind
Oh my, oh my
There's just one problem with my plan
You spend your nights with another man
No you don't rest your head with mine no more
I've gotta take my plot back to the drawing board
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand, oh my
You mentioned taking a holiday
And I recalled you couldn't swim
So I booked us scuba diving
Off the north coast of Belgium, oh my, oh my
And I drew an image in my head
Of you sinking just like lead
But I never found you washed up on the shore
I've gotta take my plot back to the drawing board, oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand, oh my
Oh, I'm the one you seldom came to see
Oh, I was hidden
Oh, I've been busy working on my scheme
Oh, to teach you how to hurt
You said you needed a haircut, I recommended Mr. Todd
Of all the men in this big bad world
He's perfect for the job, oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
I've a desperate plan in hand
So I'm a blue-print in the sand
Oh lately, I'm a heart ache
And I haven't seen you since
So now I'm praying that you're mince, oh my

When the sun shone on vetiver
When the sun shone on vetiver
When the sun shone down
Well, they're silver and they're gold
Well, they're silver and they're gold
Well, they're silver and they're cold
And I'm longing for the land
And I'm longing for their land
For nature's forgiving hand
And we're drifting and we're sailing
Now the sun aligns your legs
And your lips and arms and breasts
And the moon pulls wet Earth
And your branches crawl around my claws
And my leaves brush up against your arms
And we're dancing
In Thailand, my baby waits for me
In Graceland, my baby waits for me
In Spain land, my baby waits for me
In Ireland, my baby waits for me
In no lands, my baby waits for me
Wimpishly

Call me free today
If you see it my way
Time on my side
As well as my mind is
It's not with you for sure
No, not anymore
I intend to stay away for good
Just a matter how I define
My state of mind
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
Without your company
I have so many holes to fill
At least seven nights a week
Killing time
I still feel fine, I guess
My life was a mess
When I shared it with you
I was lonely
Now, I'm just alone
Just a matter how I define
Just a matter how I define
My state of mind
Today is a good day
Just a scratch on my ego
I get up in the morning
If we could plan tomorrow
I'll be keeping my mind cold
Until the evening when the hours forget me
And the waiting awakes me
And the voices of madness
From my subconscious singing songs of sadness
Today is a good day
Today is a good day
Oh, such a good day
Today is a good day
Today is a good day

Well I got myself a new day
And I got myself a second chance
So I headed to the bus stop
And the sun, the sun was warm on my back
Today I ran for miles
Just to see what I was made of
Today I ran for all that was mine
Well I got myself a song inside
And I got myself some full blown daylight
want to tell you just how hard it's been
Trying to talk myself out of jumping
Today I ran for miles
Just to see what I was made of
Today I ran for all that was mine, yeah
Today I ran for miles
Just to see what I was made of
Today I ran for all that was mine
Just to see what I was made of
Today I ran for all that was mine, yeah

Time it was I had a dream, and you're the dream come true.
If I had the world to give, I'd give it all to you.
I'll take you to the mountains, I will take you to the sea.
I'll show you how this life became a miracle to me.
You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day.
So when they ask how far love goes,
When my job's done you'll be the one who knows.
All the things you treasure most will be the hardest won.
I will watch you struggle long before the answers come.
But I won't make it harder, I'll be there to cheer you on,
I'll shine the light that guides you down the road you're walking on.
You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day. So when they ask how far love goes,
When my job's done you'll be the one who knows.
Before the mountains call to you, before you leave this home,
I want to teach your heart to trust, as I will teach my own,
But sometimes I will ask the moon where it shined upon you last,
And shake my head and laugh and say it all went by too fast.
You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day. So when they ask how far love goes,
When my job's done you'll be the one who knows.

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm going down to the basement ya'll
Where people all have a good time
The parties that I hear have nothing to do with
My ears are going out of my mind, mind, mind
Down here they play the real thing
Songs that were really rock and roll
It's a cliche to put it this way
But they don't make em like that anymore, more, more, more
So if they put me in the spot light
I'm never leaving the floor
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Oh
An old man gets on the mic
Tells us to hang our burdens up
He says songs you hear today all start to get in the way
Till you're barely feeling the love, love, love, love
He drops the needle on a pop song
He drops the needle on some soul
And I watch a pimp fall in love over there
Dancing to songs their parents would know, know, know, know
So everybody give me room now
Watch me cut a rug in the show
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Oh
Party people sweat out the night
Let your body do just what it likes
Just want to hear some favorite before my years
Dance soldiers forgetting our day jobs
Trying to get off cause we really came to rock and roll
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Say I really want to rock and roll

I am up on old
Strawberry Road
Trying to keep my head from spinning
Out of control
How much love can one heart hold?
You left me wanting more
What can make a house a home?
I'm not so sure
Every morning I wake up
With a little emptiness
I try to fill it through the day
But I must admit
Whenever I get to feeling lonely
I put some Jerry on
And drift until I'm gone
I let the light come in
Through each one of these wounds
Everything must have its phases
Just ask the moon
I look up and laugh and love
And try to lift
I'm doing okay I guess
But I must admit
Whenever I get to feeling lonely
I put some Jerry on
And drift until I'm gone
I am up on old
Strawberry Road
Trying to keep my head out' the gutter
Out of the cold
How much love can one heart hold?
You left me wanting more
What can make a house a home?
I'm not so sure
Mmm, Strawberry Road

What if I can't be all that you need me to be? We've got a good thing goin', we have some promises to keep. But my addiction, it can be such a detriment. Please believe in this my dear, I am more than penitent.
What if everything's just the way that it will be? Could it be that I am meant to cause you all this grief? My warships' are lying off the coast of your delicate heart and my aim is set in true, as it's been right from the start.
CHORUS: There's a degree of difficulty in dealing with me. From my haunted past, comes a daunting task of living through memories. If we could just hang a mirror on the bedroom wall, stare into the past and forget it all.
So when we leave, be a quick, midnight escape. We'll disconnect ourselves from all of yesterday. I'll dig for water and fashion our very own wishing well. Then we'll throw our coins down hoping to rid us of this little hell.
CHORUS: There's a degree of difficulty in dealing with me. From my haunted past, comes a daunting task of living through memories. If we could just hang a mirror on the bedroom wall, stare into the past and forget it all.
Will we get out of this little hell? X4

Echoes start as a cross in you
Trembling noises that come too soon
Spatial movement which seems to you
Resonating your mask or feud
Hollow talking and hollow girl
Force it up from the root of pain
Never said it was good, never said it was near
Shadow rises and you are here
And then you cut
You cut it out
And everything
Goes back to the beginning
Silence seizes a cluttered room
Light is shed not a breath too soon
Darkness rises in all you do
Standing and drawn across the room
Spatial movements are butterflies
Shadows scatter without a fire
There's never been bad, there has always been truth
Muted whisper of the things she'll move
And then you cut
You cut it out
And everything
Goes back to the beginning
Never said it was good, never said it was new
Muted whisper of the things you feel

Demon woman
Your hair is like silk, but your curdling my milk
I know not of what ilk thou are
Demon woman, woman demon
Demon woman
You sit on a rock
Looking nice in your frock, but your scaring my life stock
Demon woman, woman demon
Demon woman
Your making me moan, turn my bone into stone
And your taking me home, to meet your familiars
Nice to meet you
You cast your spell
Very well
Demon woman
Demon woman, woman demon
Demon woman
You cut puppies toes off, pull an animal's nose off
How'd you magic my clothes off?
Demon woman
Take me back to your room, make me howl at the moon
Make me pray to the temple of wombs
Demon woman, woman demon
Your breasts are balls of flame
And I'm burning my hands, playing these ball games
Demon woman
Demon woman
Demon woman, woman demon
How woman, wow wow wow
Oh
How woman, wow wow wow
How woman, wow wow wow
Oh
Demon woman

I'll be seeing you tomorrow
I'll be seeing you again
God knows we've said so little
I'd go so far as to call you a friend
But there's something in your ways
That keeps me vying for a connection
And I know you feel the same
It's become a two-way addiction
Come on and give me your heart
Write it on the back of my hand
And say it's forever
Well we never really said goodbye
Kinda left it in the air
And as the train pulled off I knew you loved her more
Oh no no no no
I'm not afraid to lose
Oh no no no no
Just give me some time and I'll walk to a different groove
Go on and give her your heart
Write it on the back of her hand
And say it's forever
Go on and give her your heart
Write it on the back of her hand
And say it's forever
That's alright, that's ok, the thoughts of you are leaving
That's alright, that's ok, the thoughts of you are leaving
Anyway, are fading anyway
Come on and give her your heart
Write it on the back of her hand
And say it's forever
Come on and give me your heart
Come on and give me your heart
Come on and give me your heart

I'm walking
I am walking along
And I am humming
I am humming
One of your songs
I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on
I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on
Everyday I hear your song now
Everyday
It won 't go away.
So I am humming
I am humming
One of your songs
I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on
I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on

A plague in the workhouse, a plague on the poor
Now I'll beat on my drum 'til I'm dead
Yesterday, a fever, tomorrow, St. Peter
I'll beat on my drum until then.
But what melody will lead my lover from his bed?
What melody will see him in my arms again?
Set fire to foundation and burn out the station
You'll never get nothing of mine
The pane of my window will flicker and billow
I won't leave a stitching behind
But what melody will lead my lover from his bed?
What melody will see him in my arms again?

I was sipping on a Whiskey when I got the call
Yeah my friend Lex was lying in the hospital
She'd been pretty sick for about half a year
But it seems liked this time the end was drawing near
So dropped my plans and jumped the next London train
I found her laid up and in a lot of pain
Her eyes met mine and then I understood
That her weather forecast wasn't looking too good
So I sat and spun her stories for a little while
Tried to raise her mood and tried to raise a smile
But she silenced all my rambling with a shake of her head
Drew me close and listen this is what she said now
"You'll live to dance another day,
It's just now you'll have to dance,
For the two of us, so stop looking so damn depressed
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead"
Yeah she told me she was sick of all the hospital food
And of doctors, distant relatives, draining her blood
She said "I know I'm dying,
But I'm not finished just yet,
I am dying for a drink and for a cigarette"
So we hatched a plan to book ourselves a cheap hotel
In the centre of the City and to raise some Hell
They waste to all the clubs
And then when everyone else is long asleep
We know we're good and done
"You'll live to dance another day,
It's just now you'll have to dance,
For the two of us,
So stop looking so damn depressed
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead"
And South London's not the same anymore
The Queen is dead,
And the last of the great has finally gone to bed
Well I was working on some words when Sarah called me up
She said that Lex had gone asleep and wasn't waking up
And even though I knew that there was nothing to be done
I felt bad for not being there and now, well, she was gone
So I tried to think what Lex would want me to do
At times like this when I was feeling blue
So I gathered up some friends to spread the sad sad news
And we headed to the City for a drink or two
And we sang
"We live to dance another day,
It's just now we have to dance for one more of us,
So stop looking so damn depressed,
And sing with all our hearts, long live the Queen"

Mind made up, I'd given all for you
See'est la folie d'amour
By now my mind is clear
You planted all the fear
Doubts and despair and
You keep my heart on the run
I'm bound to fall in love with the one
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi
So we planed a secret rendez-vous
Toute la nuit chez moi
Soon confusion grew
I sadly smiled for two
His head went down
He wore my heart like a crown
Ever since I fall for the one
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi
Wall burnt down
You never burned down yours

It's been days now
And you change your mind again
It feels like years,
And I can tell how time can bend your ideas
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard
Well it's been days now
And you change your mind again
All the cracks in the walls reminds you of things we said
And I could tell you that I wont hurt you this time
But it's just safer to keep you in this heart of mine
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard
Falling from the people that we heard
Falling from the love we never earned
Falling from the sky that should have burned
Falling from my heart

Another empty bottle in the hand
It helps to kill the things that we don't understand
The thoughtless speak, "Yeah, I'll be there for you"
Now sleep through all the dreams I never made come true
But I'm a fool for you
What would you have me do?
Oh I'm a fool for you
Trust this wretched heart to be so sure
I'd stake my life on this, but I've been wrong before
Now I don't blame you blanking me that time
Through all the awkward "How are you?"s and "I'm just fine"s
But I'm a fool for you
What would you have me do?
I'm a fool for you
Feel that spin revolver in your hand
It's impossible, you wouldn't understand
Who do we think we were to even try?
When this fear has claimed the souls of better men than I
But I'm a fool for you
What would you have me do?
I'm a fool for you
What would you have me do?

Oh, the leaves are falling from the trees
And the snow is coming, don't you know?
But I'll still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home
Oh, the sound is fading in my ears
And I can't believe I've lasted all these years
But I'll still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home
Oh, the light is fading all the time
And this life I'm in, it seems to pass me by
But I'll still remember which way to go
I'm on the road, the road to home
Now I must say goodbye
Keep telling myself now don't you cry
But I'm here where I belong
I'll see you soon, it won't be long
I'll see you soon, it won't be long
I'll see you soon, it won't be long

I saw your flag
Another star, another stripe
What's your new bag?
Something real or just some hype
Tell me, what have you sown
Have you prospered and grown?
Why shouldn't you have your moments of genius
Just because our alliance broke with no
Civil words between us
Oh, my beautiful enemy, beautiful
I send my scorn and ridicule
You're not innocent
No, not innocent
No one's innocent
My nation's grand
Your name's not on any signs
It's so well-planned
And well-groomed and yet somehow
The past tornadoes through
People talk about you
Can't they see that your reign
Is steely and torturous?
I start thinking that I am sinking
Inside a hollow fortress
Oh, my enemy, beautiful enemy
My stride is slowed by memory but
Not innocent
No, not innocent
No one's innocent
In my furies of dream
The juries denounce you
There I stand with the upper hand
But in order to trounce you
I just keep getting above myself
I just keep getting above myself
And so I'm worried but as I stated
Things can be complicated, but
You're my enemy
You're my enemy
You're my enemy
The future's bright
There are new things we will love
It feels so right
Let's not make up or rise above
Yes, we are more corrupted
Happy and productive
We'll both live in a world of civilized
People
Though I've heard that my brand new church
Has a slightly higher steeple
Oh, my enemy, beautiful enemy
Hail to your vast hegemony
You're not innocent
I'm not innocent
No one's innocent
Oh, my enemy, beautiful enemy
Hail to your vast hegemony
You're not innocent
I'm not innocent
No one's innocent

Take a breath
And ill give it to you
Knowing that its my last
Parting gift
She wanted to move like the wind blows
Shes calling to me I cant say no
Sunshine did your shadow notice me
falling behind the kite
Oh they looked on jealously
Drowning in you
Lost in your memory
Caught in a gale
Blown out to sea
Counting on you
hoping I survive
I've waited too long
to close my eyes
now.
I'm hearing her sing
When the wind blows
Shes calling to me I cant say no
Your smile
Oh it weakens my knees
So hold me a while
And ill go
Quietly
Drowning in you
Lost in your memory
Caught in a gale
Blown out to sea
Counting on you
Hoping I survive
I've waited too long
To close my eyes
Now.

There's a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake,
Yeah, it's out there on the cutting edge, the people move, the sidewalks shake.
And there's another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds,
Where the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with free-standing tubs.
They're in houses that are haunted, the with kids who lie awake and think about
All the generations past who used to use that dripping sink.
And sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to see
What it's like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of Mrs. Ogilvey,
She used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the Sunday pork,
Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.
It wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools,
It wants to have a diner where the coffee tastes like diesel fuel,
And it wants to find the glory of a town they say has hit the skids,
And it wants to have a snow day that will turn its parents into kids,
And it's embarrassed, but it's lusting after a SUNY student with mousy brown hair who is
Taking out the compost, making coffee in long underwear.
And southern California says to save a place, I'll meet you there,
And it tried to pack up its Miata, all it could fit was a prayer,
Sometimes the stakes are bogus, sometimes the fast lane hits a fork,
Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.
Tempe, Arizona thinks the Everglades are greener and wetter,
And Washington, D.C. thinks that Atlanta integrated better,
But I think that southern California has more pain that we can say,
'Cause it wants to travel back in time, but it just can't leave L.A.
But now I hear they've got a theme park planned, designed to make you gasp and say,
Oh, I bet that crumbling mill town was a booming mill town in its day,
And the old investors scoff at this, but the young ones hope they'll take a chance,
And they promise it will make more dough than Mickey Mouse in northern France,
And the planners planned an opening day, a town historian will host,
And the waitresses look like waitresses who want to leave for the west coast.
And they'll have puttering on rainy weekends, autumn days that make you feel sad,
They'll have hundred year old plumbing and the family you never had,
And a Hudson River clean-up concert and a bundle-bearing stork,
And I hear they've got a menu planned, it's trés western New York.

I still see you as a baby, I do
Climbing onto the stage in front of the school
High strung
The cat got your tongue
The spotlight came out
You'd been strung
I followed the trail
when I heard that they found
you in the cowshed
I still see the insect filled jars in rows
The calculations and the diagrams, constellations
High strung
The cat got your tongue
The spotlight came out
You'd been hung
I followed the trail
when I heard that they found
You in the cowshed

By myself,
I wanna be here,
For you to hold,
Left alone I feel the pain,
Take me away,
Someday,
And I dream of the day,
I found you once,
I found you once again,
All the feelings you wanted to share,
But they were too much for you,
I found you once,
I found you once...
By myself,
Will fall to the floor,
And feel no pain,
Underline what's mine,
You take no more,
Well come again,
Someday...
Someday's lost...
Someday's lost...
Someday's lost...
The weakness,
Is killing,
The weakness,
The weakness killed me...
Running for my own sake,
Can't seem to get this straight,
I'm alone,
I'm alone,
I'm alone...
(repeat)

When you go, take my coat with you
So when it snows I'll stay wrapped around your shoulders
When you drink, raise your glass to me
And you can think of all the inconvenient ways the days would pass for me and you
And if you sing, sing my songs
'Cause if you sang anyone else's you won't think of me for nearly
As long as I live I'll always find your socks in my bed
My bed, socks in my bed, my bed, my little bed
I always find your socks in my bed, my bed
I'll always find your socks in my bed
And in the morning, whisper softly
'Cause these walls are paper thing
Take a pair of my Golden Toes
And was them in your laundry and I'll use them when we sleep on 33rd
And when we're old, old and grey
Would you properly issue pills into the pillbox that I need for the day
That I die will be the day there aren't socks in my bed
[chorus]
Well there was a mouse and I found him in the bathroom of your
Second floor apartment but you thought he was adorable
So I watched as he navigated mazes you created using empty paper towel rolls and boots
So if you sing, sing my songs
'Cause if you sing anyone else's you won't think of me for nearly as long
As I live, I'll always find your socks in my bed

The body breaks and the body is fine
And I'm open to yours and I'm open to mine
The body aches and that ache takes it time
But you'll get over yours and I'll get over mine
And the sun will shine
And the moon will rise up
The body calls, yeah, the body, it calls out
It whispers at first but it ends with a shout
The body burns, yeah, the body burns strong
Until mine is with yours then mine will burn on
My flesh sings out
It sings, "Come put me out"
The body sways like the wind on a swing
A bridge through a hoop or a lake through a ring
The body stays and then the body moves on
And I'd really rather not dwell on when yours will be gone
But within the dark there is a shine
One tiny spark that's yours and mine

Take me to your home
Take me to your soul
Wanna feel my breath
Wanna fly to sky
Can you see me now?
Fucking network
Wanna know
How i live
How i want to be with you
Pre-Chorus:
Tell me what you feel
When you lie to me
I wanna tell to you
What I know
I'm wanna tell my truth
Chorus (x2):
Wanna feel
Feel your touch
Feel your eyes
be a sense of life
Your best friend are drugs
You had 2 boys on street
Today is tuesday
Hello, my dear friend
And it's my 10 days
I'm tryin' to forget you babe
Fall back down
You going suicide
I'm tryin' to help you now
You say me 'Thank you!!'
I'm thinking what I have
My best mate
Today
Your day
Love, high
Go high
Pre-Chorus:
Tell me what you feel
When you lie to me
I wanna tell to you
What I know
I'm wanna tell my truth
Chorus (x2):
Wanna feel
Feel your touch
Feel your eyes
be a sense of life

V1.
Sweet as our slumber
Sharp like an ax
Can you remember
How good; what we had
You can't tell me you don't mean to
And I can't act like this is right
The game we play has gotten oh so see through
But at the end of the day, what's one more night?
Ch.
So I watch my back
Whenever you are not at my front
Brace for attack
Cuz I never really know what you want
But when the lights go down
It's a torture that I cannot resist
I should turn around
But I suppose I could stay if you insist.
V2.
Comes faster than falling
And it leaves like a ghost
So lovely; so haunting
My poisonous host
You can't tell me you don't love it
And I'd be lying if I said I mind
I could pretend that I am above it
But at the end of the day, what's one more time?
BR.
I can play your fool
It's such a small price to pay
Let me break your rules
I promise you won't complain

Don't wake up, baby sister
Keep dreaming
Do you feel your cup?
Baby sister, keep drinking
Or he'll hit you
He'll bleach your eyes
So be a good girl just for the night
And run! Run!
Don't get stuck,
Baby sister, leave this land
and meet your bulls!
Baby sister, wash your hands
Or he'll hit you
He'll bleach your eyes
So be a good girl just for the night
And run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run, baby sister, run!
Baby sister.

In the hall I heard your faints falling,
your trial and my corrections made.
You have all the prayers of my loose heart.
You have all the prayers of
No I was not there on the church stairs.
The wind in my hair, a flood through my tear

Mr. Howell: The dinner was fine until she opened her mouth.
Oh, Candy! Oh, Candy! Behind her teeth 15 rats started screaming and sobbing. Candy girl! Candy girl!
When we were kissing in the car
those rodents smoked cigars in her throat, blowing smoke.
(You turn on the lights and look a bit closer... there's shutters on her eyes, there's a door on her thigh.)
Candy: These rats are not living inside my hotel face.
They're just sick and they need a bed lined with fine lace.
Mr. Howell: You know that pity's got an ugly price tag.
Rats: Our fur feels like it's on fire. There's thorns growing on our bones.
Our hunger is x-rated.
Oh, mother, we love you so!
(Candy invites you upstairs, you say it's getting awfully late, but she yanks your hand through the door. Her clothes fall off and she presses into you. But those rats have chewed a hole straight through her navel and nipple.)
Mr. Howell: Oh, Candy. I've got to go.
Candy: Oh, won't you stay the night with me Mr. Howell!
These rats are not living inside my hotel face.
They're just sick and need a bed lined with fine lace.
Mr. Howell: You know that pity's got an ugly price tag. [x2]
Rats: Our muscles have turned to cement.
We're coughing up needles and nails.
Our veins are flowing barbed wire.
Oh, mother, we are so frail! but wait!
We've got a trick for him.
We twist tears into shit eaten grins.
(When you wake up in the morning you find yourself alone in Candy's bed. And everything is gone: paintings, jewels, songs. Candy's blowing in the breeze; those rats devoured her up in her sleep. Her skin's tied to the bed post like a flag on a ship of ghosts. You read the letter on the dresser; the sick brown sun rubbing in your soul).
Reading letter: Oh, mother, you should have known.
You should have seen through our fake broken bones.
Our tears that we razor-sharpened were calculated to rob you blind.
Mr. Howell: Three weeks later from that day,
I saw those rats on a bicycle.
They crept by me and started balling,
their eyes turned to icicles.
Crying, "We need a vacancy!"

I'm on your side
And we're always right
It's perfect
And worth it
And you're on my side
And we're always right
It's the circuit
That gets worse yet
I'm on you side
And we're always right
It's the circuit
That gets worse yet
So leave me to die in the comfort
Of my own home
Of my own home
Of my own

Me and you
I better laugh in twenty years from now
With some perspective and dedication
I will find somebody new
It better be someone special
He better be coming very soon
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you
You or no one
I hope I'm wrong before I die of boredom
I wantmore than
Days and nights when I amuse
Myself alone
He better be someone special
He better be devoted just like you
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you
You, you, with you
Friends forever, oh no
Another girl will change your mind
In less than half the summer
So before you fall in love, I wonder
When you asked for
Something that I couldn't give you
More of
Me and you
I talk as if it's now but nothing is new
She better be someone special
She better be more in love than me
And if I was your brightest hour
She is now, as far as I can see, see
As far as I can see
As far as I can see
She better be
She better be
She better be
She better be

Replenish your blossoming bacchanal
And let regret end at the start of the day
And don't take no secret back to your grave
Let everyone know
Let everyone know
Angelika, Angelika, Angelika
Angelika, Angelika, Angelika
If wildness covers the colors you sense
Then how could you think God has no friends
If life's for the living and death for the dead
And love's in your heart and hate's in your head
You got to go blank to let it appear
The garden on high grows bigger each year
Without the black stone you can't break the string
The omniverse sings of all these things
Angelika, Angelika, Angelika
Angelika, Angelika, Angelika
Cañoneros disparando
Aguinaldo en el barrio
Velero de luz que trae el cambio
Que caiga la cruz y suba dios
La lagrima en to corazon
Suelta la, suelta la mi amor
Mi amor mi amor
Angelika, Angelika
Cañoneros disparando
Aguinaldo en el barrio
Velero de luz que trae el cambio
Que caiga la cruz y suba dios
La lagrima en to corazon
Suelta la, suelta la mi amor
Mi amor mi amor

I was painting a still life this morning
Of a throat lozenge sitting on a copy of Tropic of Cancer
The only thing weird about it is that a year ago
I never thought I'd paint anything again
I decided I wasn't ever gonna paint again
It didn't bother me too much, Warhol's dead
David Hockney's still alive, I don't need to paint
I painted over ten thousand paintings
Sad ones, funny ones, dark ones and light ones
I've done haystacks and rich old ladies by their pools
Wearing nothing but a scarf
I've painted everything there was to paint
Now it was time to sit back, give interviews
Get on the internet, hang out at club med
Take stock of what I've done
You know, the best friend I ever had was a dog
It sounds like a cliche unless it's happened to you
Some days that dog was the only reason I even got out of bed
That dog went everywhere with me and then I heard the crack addicts
Were stealin' dogs and selling them for animal research
It sounded like an urban myth to me like the mouse in the Coke bottle
But I started leavin' her at home after that
You know, Paula was my wife for a while
She ran off to Paris with the great grandson of Van Gogh
A cartoonist who did fashion graphics for Le Monde
When Paula left she took my dog, I never saw her again
Except in the court during the custody battle
She won and got to keep the dog
And I didn't speak to anyone for months
You know sometimes it feels
Like there's so much that you need
Sometimes the world is upside down
Sometimes it seems like the only thing you need
Is holdin' someone's hand as you walk through town
I started hanging around with Dino
He used to run a poker game back east
Now he has a little coffee shop, sells cappuccino to his old pals
Tommy, Chicago and Jimmy the Wig and Ugly Rose
You know the best person I ever knew
Was a Mormon woman named Estelle
She still calls me drunk every few months
And asks me stuff I don't want to talk about
You can't talk to her long unless you're drunk yourself
Then we go all night
Yeah she goes, "Why baby, why baby, why baby, why
Have you turned your back on love?
You had so many chances
Why have you let 'em all go by?"
Well, one morning I was sitting out in front of Dino's place
With Jake the Shears, a guy from Philly who gives free mohawks
There were a couple of young painters, I was hopin' to come by
So I could give 'em some advice
Yeah, I was sittin' there updating my list of enemies
When this girl walks in and the universe kind of stops
Turned out she drank the same tea as me
Don't take more than that to start a conversation sometimes
She believed collage was the greatest of all the arts
And was busy pasting pictures of horses, next to ads for laundry soap
Next to Mohammed Ali, she had a turquoise in her ear
And said Rachmaninoff was always in her head
But later that day I was trying to describe her to Jimmy the Wig
I couldn't find any words and I realized I'd started to sketch her chin
Somehow it didn't look right, I scratched it out and tried it again
I filled an entire pad, I threw it away, I never even came close
For a six days I sat at Dino's place
The rain wouldn't quit and no one came in
Finally on the seventh day it cleared and in she walked
I asked her to sit with me and I bought her a cup of tea
And I asked her to model for me sometime
That afternoon I was at a canvas
She was wearing a yellow dress
I swore if she let me, I'd get it right
I've painted over ten thousand paintings
Sad ones, funny ones, dark ones, and light ones
But sitting there, it was like I couldn't even write my own name
I apologized and said, "It's been a few months
If you have patience, I'll get the hang of it again"
In the next few weeks, I painted her hundreds of times
If I get the nose right, the chin's too long
If I get 'em both right, the face is too thin
But I keep after it and one day I, I'll get it all right
I painted a still life this morning, of a throat lozenge
Sitting on a copy of Tropic of Cancer
The only thing was funny is that
I never thought I'd paint anything again
I think I might go visit Estelle
Those Utah mountains are good for the soul
I'll bring my brushes and some Jack Daniels
And we can make up for lost time
And she said, "Why baby, why baby, why baby why?
Baby why have you turned your back on love
You had so many chances
Why have you let 'em all go by?"
And she says, "Why baby, why baby, why baby why?
Baby why have you turned your back on love
You had so many chances
Why have you let 'em all go by?"
Sometimes it seems like there's so much that you need
Sometimes the world is upside down
Sometimes it seems like the only thing you need
Is holdin' someone's hand as you walk through town

(feat. Rick Garcia)
Have you noticed that I'm standing back on my feet
It doesn't matter if you don't feel like talking to me
Now I realize that everything was in my head
It doesn't matter what you're thinking if it cannot be said
Yeah you are always a part of something missing
Yeah you are always a part of something missing
I once believed in the words that you used to say
I was always moving closer now I'm moving away
I'm gonna move far away, far from it all
Nothings ever what it seems till you rise from your fall
Yeah you
You're always a part of something missing
Yeah you
You're always a part of something missing
Yeah you
You're always a part of something missing
Yeah you
You're always a part of something missing
Always a part of something missing
Always a part of something missing

He draws near the periphery
In disbelief on delivery
Came child from the deep inferno
Crusty head of dead volcano
Heartless crow with brittle beak
Wooden leg too schocked to speak
Lilac dust of a woman's hair
A wooden cross a paper prayer
A stone where her body lay
A stack of feathers a pile of hay
A mushroom for an eye ball
A mustache from the snow fall
Worms weave a ring where fairies square dance
Queens and kings fairies weave wigs with eyelash
Trance music makes the fairies dance
From the caves of snail shells
Echoes the mutter medieval spells
Mystery flows her wicked river
Of thorn and blade and silver sliver
Bending 'round the clover fields
Their sapling stems don't break but yield
Her pain inflicts no arguments
Must learn to sway and un-arrange
As earth she makes her final passage
After humans long have ravaged
Vanished with all maps for motion
Upward angels last devotion
One by one escort us home
To leave the elementals free to roam
To bathe in the last of ocean's foam
To beach comb the nuclear debris
Our plastic toys and our metal trees
On the perfect day you'll find the breeze
Once blew the pollen the feet of bees
Now cry the stars when upon the earth
Their gaze might rest a nostalgic burst
A lament be heard through all the cosmos
Of the dying planet with fallen foes

You know it's hard to be yourself,
Free yourself, to see yourself
When all around you there are lies just to get you,
Spies just to get you, to buy so they can get you
There are cameras in the sky, lasers in our living rooms
There are wolves watching wearing sheep's costumes
[Chorus]
It's enough to make you go crazy (whoa)
It's enough to make you mad
It's enough to make you go crazy (whoa)
And I'm amazed I haven't yet
Isn't it a shame the way we cheat each other, treat each other,
Beat each other?
It's a shame the way we use one other, abuse one another,
And screw one another, it's true.
They will lock you up in prison but they won't call it slavery
There are stolen children raised and trained in armies
[Chorus]
Don't hesitate to speak your mind (speak your mind)
Never hesitate to speak your heart (speak your heart)
They'll call you crazy when you speak your mind (when you speak your mind)
So never, never hesitate (never hesitate)
[Chorus]
Na sol them go lock you for prison
Na sol them go beat you for prison
Them no call it slavery
It's him that make me vex
Na sol them go lock you for prison
Na sol them go beat you for prison
It's him that make me vex
It's him that make me craze
It's enough to make you go crazy (Whoa)
It's enough to make you mad
It's enough to make you go crazy (Whoa)
And I'd be crazy not to care

Well these days I'm spread so thin
I'm getting carried up by the wind
Every time you get high
You might see me floating by
Well so long old bean
It's been a dream being with you
I couldn't tell us apart
Oh and I know neither could you
Don't tread on me
When you float downstream
On a moonbeam
So long old bean
So long old bean
Here comes the Mapinguari singing awww
When's there gonna be an end to wondering
When all of our troubles are gonna end 'cause
We've had our fill of finding our empty pockets
Emptier still and there probably won't be
An end to that my friends
Now that my tralala's are dating
Little sips of the Hollywood bowl
They mute up my mind
How kind of them to mellow mellow mellow my soul
Well they're the gambling kind
As smooth as a tuba' ass on the dole
Money never beats soul
How noble
Don't forget me
When you float downstream
On a moonbeam
So long old bean
So long old bean
I'm a little firefly
Landing on you

And each strand of her hair
Is really insect eyes
And each hole in her tongue
Is always occupied by the milk of the sun
And each head on her head
Is fields of gold wheat
Where I'm lying on my back
Where I'm falling asleep
And each lash in her eye
Is really white roots
And each line in her skin
Is really red roots
And the neck her head's on
Is a tunnel of dawn
But darkness will come
But darkness will come
For sure, it's gonna come
And the breast on her chest
Is where I take my rest
Is where I have my fun
Is where I have my fun
And one long red nail
That shots from her toe
Is tickling my blood
And shifting its flow
And each strand of her hair
Is really insect eyes
And each hole in her tongue
Is always occupied by the milk of the sun
And I'm always late, always late
And I'm always late
Yeah, I'm always late
Yeah, I'm always late
And your black tulips of time
And your black tulips of time
And your hands rejoice in mine
And that seed it grows all day
And that seed it grows all night
And our veins are intertwined

Euro

le mark et le franc
il me manque le mark et le franc
Everybody get up now,
Get ready for the wow,
Put your arms up in the sky,
I'll hit the money note, the money note.
And Dolly Parton wrote it,
And Whitney Houston stole it,
If Celine Dion could reach it,
I'll hit the money note, the money note.
I want it to sound like silver,
And I want it to sound like gold,
I never would sing for my supper,
My soul can't be bought and sold.
I'm waiting in the spotlight,
I'm ready for the fight,
I'm looking so hot tonight,
I'll hit the money note, the money note.
And Dolly Parton wrote it,
And Whitney Houston stole it,
If Celine Dion could reach it,
I'll hit the money note, the money note.
Money note, money note, money note, money note.
I wanted to take it higher,
Ooh you would be amazed,
I just want to beat Mariah,
Oh, let me deserve their place.
Everybody get up now, (Yeah)
Get ready for the wow, (For the money note)
I'll hit the money note,
Here it is!

il me manque le mark et le franc
Il me manque marc et franc

Butterflies with gilded wings this morning
Touched the red sun and the rain
On the bridge the workers pass in threes and fours and fives
To my sleeplessness
Reflections after Jane
How I long to live inside a window
By the sighing motorway
Feel the city searching for my loneliness
In all the dust and glass
Reflections after Jane
And I see her all on a golden Sunday
With her hair so dark in the rain
Who is in the newspapers this month or week or year
My silent friend
I can starve my life into a deeper sleep
Remembering
Reflections after Jane

they where born in the name of god
they where the superiors in the name of god
hey you outside the cold
dressed in white and looking old
what did you think you were told?
did you think we were living forever
did you ever fell? innocent?
i don't think so!
and yet i don't think as we fall deeper
why!!!
they were born in the name of god
they declined in the name of god!
why god?
hey you outside the cold
dressed in white and looking old
what did you think you were told?

So this is continuous happiness
You know, I always imagined it something more
With the right drapes, the right paints
The right frames, this could really work
What a great day to spend indoors
[Chorus]
Wake, wake up, wake, wake up
Wake, wake up, wake, wake up
Wake, wake up, wake, wake up
Wake, wake up, wake, wake up
In a hail of sparks
And a tangle of wires
Everything went wrong
So where has all the day gone?
And why are my lungs aching when I breathe?
Is there something wrong with the heat? Why am I so cold?
And my heart feels sick and it hurts when I speak
And this is not what I hoped for
[Chorus]
Was this what we hoped for?
Was this what we hoped for?
Was this what we, what we hoped for?
Was this what we hoped for?
Was this what we hoped for?
Was this?

cash advances and jenny's back on campus
i can't believe that it's september
said jenny what's the story, all the chicks in her sorority
asked her how she spent the summer
said i interned at some law firm, i got a little sunburned
i saw some raver kid get murdered
i met a guy, and this guy i met he got me high
and the drum and bass sounds a lot like rollin' thunder
and the blue looks beautiful as it tops off the torch
you don't have to go inside to buy, you can buy it off the porch
twenty-seven lovers in the back half of the summer
i know you think that's way too many
but the x makes me feel sexy and the sex makes me feel empty
the alcohol destroys me
and i did it in a disco with some guy from san francisco
who looked a lot like roger daltry
and the night of all that bloodshed i was kissin' on some crackhead
who said he knew about a party, he keeps it in his mouth in those crazy chipmunk cheeks
i gave him fifty and he kissed me, spit a little treat between my teeth
i think we're starting to peak
woke up at some hedonistic rodeo
with cowboys kissing cowboys, trading magazines for videos
god bless the radio, all that fine fine music without all the messed up musicians
and dwight's a magician, he gets sensible people makin' terrible decisions
her name was sally but they all called her sal mineo
she was lit up like an arson but she burned out like arsenio
her name was sandy but they all called her san antonio
she can't remember where she slept last night but she won't forget the alamo
sandy, don't forget our alibi

Well i won't be younger than today
i've walked amillion miles but i'm still on my way.
What if seven clouds fly over head?
Would seven kisses make us ok again?
Well i will say goodbye ok
because this may be the last time.
And i wan't you to know i love you,
forever my friend.

Rolling down the street,
Diggin' the wind in my window
'Cause today we be high rollin'
High rollin' baby.
Life aint what it seems,
Too many people thinking money is the way to get free.
Time is golden.
Time is golden, you crazy?
Yo girl you're so sweet,
Too busy dancing to the rhythm to be shuffling your feet.
Hey where you going, hey where you going now lady?
These walls talk to me.
There's a world outside so why'm i let them trap in me?
See i'm a going, see i'm a going to baby.
And all i ever did was waste my time,
Sat upon my porch but i'm feelin' fine.
The time goes but the memory still shows,
So for now i guess i'm getting me another one,
So it seems.
Rollin' down the road,
There's an old man sitting where the pothole goes.
He's aware, he's aware of what's real.
Told me to move slow,
Too many people rush then they lose their flow.
For sure we're, for sure we're not i feel.
Yo girl you're so nice,
The way you move so crazy girl it's just not right.
I don't care, i don't care what i steal,
If it makes you right.
Why're my legs feeling heavy when my head is light?
Yo there, yo there is my deal.

Perhaps I am a miscreation
No one knows the truth there is no future here
And you're the DJ speaks to my insomnia
And laughs at all I have to fear
Laughs at all I have to fear
You always play the madmen poets
Vinyl vision grungy bands
You never know who's still awake
You never know who understands and
Are you out there, can you hear this?
Jimmy Olson, Johnny Memphis,
I was out here listening all the time
And though the static walls surround me
You were out there and you found me
I was out here listening all the time
Last night we drank in parking lots
And why do we drink? I guess we do it cause
And when I turned your station on
You sounded more familiar than that party was
You were more familiar than that party
It's the first time I stayed up all night
It's getting light I hear the birds
I'm driving home on empty streets
I think I put my shirt on backwards
Are you out there, can you hear this
Jimmy Olson , Johnny Memphis
I was out here listening all the time
And though the static walls surround me
You were out there and you found me
I was out here listening all the time
And what's the future, who will choose it?
Politics of love and music
Underdogs who turn the tables
Indie versus major labels
There's so much to see through
Like our parents do more drugs than we do
Oh
Corporate parents, corporate towns
I know every TV set that has them lit
They preach that I should save the world
They pray that I won't do a better job of it
Pray that I won't do a better job
So tonight I turned your station on just so I'd be understood
Instead another voice said I was just too late
And just no good
Calling Olson, Calling Memphis
I am calling, can you hear this?
I was out here listening all the time
And I will write this down
And then I will not be alone again yeah
I was out here listening
Oh yeah I was out here listening
Oh yeah I am out here listening all the time

The electric heart
Shines for you
It's giving off sparks
But that's nothing new
The electric heart
Spins it's lightning web
The spider's sparkle
Lights the way ahead
I eat the biscuts
A gift from her
I eat the fishes
They got no fur
The open road
Of God's final town
I'll take a little sip
From its honey drip
The earth-hurt skies
Say your name
The earth was dry
Until you came
A little baby begins to grow
A happy belly begins to glow
The electric sky
Combing in the snow
He's always high
He's a gentle soul
My winter friends
With Christmas legs
And cold, cold beards
And frozen heads
We keep them shiny
We keep them shown
'Cause though they're tiny
They're valuable
Now I've lost my nails
But that's nothing new
And goddamn thumbs
Thumbs, goddamn you
And if all else fails
To win the race
Then someone else for sure
Will take my place
Now flung from dreams
Your voice reappears
And it almost seems
Like you're almost here
Singing an ancient chant
That spreads its dusty legs
And I'm coming in
In my head
Electric heart
Shine for us
Shiny love
Shiny love
Shiny love
Shiny love
Shiny love
Shiny love
Shiny love

Nothing unusual, nothing strange
Close to nothing at all
The same old scenario, the same old rain
And there's no explosions here
Then something unusual, something strange
Come from nothing at all
I saw a spaceship fly by your window
Did you see it disappear?
Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed
Just a little older that's all
You know when you've found it
There's something I've learned
'Cause you feel it
When they take it away, hey , hey, hey
Something unusual, something strange
Come from nothing at all
But I'm not a miracle
And you're not a saint
Just another soldier
On the road to nowhere
Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
And Amie come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
And tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

I left this earth today
Didn't look back at my terrain
Sold my possessions at sea
Followed the fortune of destiny
I knelt before the king
Stared with wonder at what life may bring
And filled with confidence
I set upon my close legend
Oh Devine Soldier, life taker of this land
Oh Devine Soldier life taker will command,
So do as you will
I travelled far and wide
a journey made with no compromise
and climbing port to peak I took the passage of which you speak
I lay on sheets of gold
I stared at eyes that hold this world
And with each prophesy
I took my leap, my leap to be

Coming from an endless place
Heaven hits me when I see your face
I go blind, every time
Hate to have to watch you go
Thought I'd been through this
Lord knows, I've been trying, I'm still trying
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
I would watch you, look right through me
Right through every word that I say
He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do
But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
Yes, I would watch you, learn to love you
And her, too, if you'd only stay, but
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do
This time I swear that I do
This time I swear that I do
But I will turn and walk away
I will watch you turn and walk away

On a holiday
or a special vacation
Minds are drifting out to a new location
What an easy way
to get away away for a while
Don't bring a thing
because we won't be moving a mile
It's all in a dream
And it's the best place I've been
Up in the sky with no aeroplane
Loving every minute of paradise
Behind my eyes there's no goodbyes
In a sordid way
I had an awful day yesterday
I lost my cool with my girl
so she tippy-tip-toed away
Here I am, wow, I'm a lonely guy
No one cares for me
I went home that night and cried myself to sleep
Should've been in a dream
Cause that's the best place I've been
Up in the sky with no aeroplane
Loving every minute of paradise
Behind my eyes there's no goodbyes
Up in the sky with no aeroplane
Loving every minute of paradise
Behind my eyes there's no goodbyes

Cigarretes and taste of your JD
That room can't hide the lips of my lady
She's sometimes kind of brave and through her glass and ice
I'm loosing all my senses
Why don't you dance in front of me?
I was so upset, babe, but you got me
Who knows if you're waiting for anything?
Until the night is over
They're playing that song again and your eyes are following
The best way to get into my mind
The people is looking arround to see how you move
You feel mischievous
Why don't you dance in front of me?
I was so upset, babe, but you got me
Who knows if you're waiting for anything?
Until the night is over

You're just a joke 'till somebody loves you
You're just a joke 'till somebody cares
You're an activism line, you're a clock run out of time
You're a story that ain't going nowhere
Legion dances and black coffee
Warm nights that never end
You're an actor missing lines, you're a clock run out of time
You're a story that seems without an end
Everything I do, I do it for you
You're just a joke 'till somebody loves you
You're just a joke 'till somebody cares
You're an activism line, you're a clock run out of time
You're a story that's going nowhere

I'm so childish, a little bit wildish
With my rumdiddlyumdiddlyumdiddly, I'm so deep
Well I'm so garish, a little unfairish
The way I pick you up, and drop you in a heap
I'm so unfaithful, in fact I'm a plateful
I won't kiss her, but I'll stare her up all night
I'm a stormy little singer, an unstable little swinger
If you're coming, come prepared for a fight
Well I'm so childish, a little bit wildish
With my rumdiddlyumdiddlyumdiddly, I'm so deep
Well I'm so uncaring, do far too much swearing
And if you read through my behaviour, you'll find I'm a creep
I'll play a stormer, yet in the corner
I'll be grumpy on my own, like I don't care
I'm a stormy little singer, an unstable little swinger
With a big rip, in the arsehole of my flares
Well I'm so childish, a little bit wildish
With my rumdiddlyumdiddlyumdiddly, I'm so mad
I'm so truthful, a little bit bruteful
But in sooth I know not, why I am so sad
I try my bestest, well as far the restest
Well it's just stuff that comes out wrong, and gets misunderstood
I'm a dandy little dreamer, a doctored misdemeanour
A didactic destiny schemer, bare with me if you would

Go down to the gallows at midnight,
With silk draped to cover your face.
Go down to the gallows, they'll soon take my life,
And lay your eyes over the place.
Here comes the priest and the prophet,
The cold steel floor on my feet.
I hope that you come down to see me,
And give a dyin' boy his wish of relief.
Here stands the man dressed in black now,
He says with a trembling sigh:
"D'you have any words or requests now?
Tell me, please, before you die"
Go down to the gallows at midnight,
With silk draped to cover your face.
Go down to the gallows, they'll soon take my life,
And lay your eyes over the place.

And a fall from you
Is a long way down
I've found a better way out
And a fall from you
Is a long way down
I know a better way out
Well it's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile
Gambled away my fright
Till the morning lights shine
Well it's been a long time
Since I've seen you smile
Gambled away my fright
Till the morning lights shine
Sunday morning
Only fog on the limbs
I called it again
What do you know
And I filled our days
With cards and gin
You're alight again, my dear

Lately the birds have started to fly
Away from the town and into the sky
I'm over here you're over there
I'm holding my breath 'cause I know
That you care about the small things
Distance delightfully melts all the space
Between all the cities and all the great lakes
And into the night we talk about the world
It's easy to see when you're light years away
And I'm waiting
Daisy chains wont break the love that you gave
Don't throw it away 'cause I'm here to say
Counting all the stars reflections in time
All of the places you leave behind
Remind me of when i had smoke in my eyes
I could see the sights, been driving for miles
Daisy chains wont break the love that you gave
Don't throw it away 'cause I'm here to stay
Everyday you'll find a little piece of mind
To carry that weight across the line

When they come from over the mountain
Yeah, we'll run we'll run right around them
We've got no guns no we don't have any weapons
Just our cornmeal and our children
The dusk runs, the dark clouds but not us but not us
While we pay for mistakes with no meaning
All your gifts and all your peace is deceiving
And still our pain dissolves with believing
That peace comes, that peace comes
That peace comes, that peace comes
Now that our bones lay buried below us
Just like stones pressed into the earth
Well, we ain't known by no one before us
And we begin with this one little birth
That grows on, that grows on
That grows on, that grows on
Crippled crow say something for grieving
Where do we go once we start leaving?
Well, close that wound or else keep on bleeding
And change your tune it's got no meaning

I hate love, I really do
It never works out quite
The way I want it to
The trap gets set
Dont they know
The walls go up
And then drama begins
Its all part of the show
It's a wonderful thing
When its happening
It's a wonderful thing
When its happening
I hate love, I tell you the truth
Ill be the first one there
To open up the way
That Im supposed to
But it's an empty room
Im all by myself
The other part of the equation
Comes and goes, and never takes a step
It's a wonderful thing
When it's happening
It's a wonderful thing
When it's happening
This is how it goes
Were lonely, hollow souls
Without love
Without love we might as well give up
I hate love, I really do
But there's something to be said
For all the joy that came with you
It's a wonderful thing

Black Tornado - Dan Bern from his album New American Language
I been speaking-
later and later in the day-
Most days I don't talk
'til maybe 8 o'clock at night It keeps me whole,
It keeps me holy. It keeps me way up
in the mountains even when I'm on the road
It keeps me coming up for air
Keeps me airing out some come
It keeps me cool
And everyplace I go is one less place I could call home
And every girl I kiss, well I just cross her off my list
I don't go far
I just go crazy
I buried all of my old clothes out in some field in West Des Moines
And if you judge me tonight
Judge me by the songs I write
That's who I am to you
(background) lil more guitar)
(chourus)And there's a Black Tornado
Black Tornado
Spinning around in my body sometimes
Black Tornado
a Black Tornado
Spinning around in my body sometimes
And I could do tonight with something soft and warm and furry
But that ain't likely to occur in southcentral Missouri
It's a day off
It's an off-day
It's a Budweiser, Budgetel, Bukowski kind of night
All I got's what's on my back
this Guitar and a backpack
My soul's intact
(chourus)And there's a Black Tornado. . . .
And everything is changing faster than I can describe
All I really know to do is grab the wheel and drive
I look for love
And some adventure
And I try not to let my own breathing scare me off the road
There is a tombstone
Of my father I visit sometimes
There is a tombstone
Of my father I visit sometimes
And there's a Black Tornado...

Yeah I seen you there
Looking all pretty when you brushed your hair
Yeah I like it when you smile
Won't you stay with me just for a little while?
Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go
Pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa
Sitting here now beneath them stars
Makes me wanna take them wings to my arms
She's got this way, she's got this way
Of wrapping her little heart around mine
Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go
Pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa

I could tell you stories
Could you teach me some more?
Ill tell you bout the countries
Youve never been before
Ill go on forever
Forever in a day
Until you lose the interest
Right then I walk away
So I wont let that happen
Not while were living free
I can be the poet
You can be the story
You can keep me grounded
Keep me on my toes
Ill always be chasing you
Wherever you may go
And if you slip ahead
And break away from us
Dont run out of sight
I just might not catch up
But I wont let that happen
Not while were having fun
You can be the runner
I can be the gun
Ill be waiting for you here
When you come calling
Ill be waiting
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
We can sit in silence
I know thats what you love
I learn to appreciate
The beauty from the love
And I can share my secrets
Ive only sung before
You can choose to stand by me
Or simply to ignore
So I wont let that happen
While we both belong
You can be the singer
And I can be the song
Ill be waiting for you here
When you come calling
Ill be waiting
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
Solo (Chorus)
I could tell you stories
Could you teach me some more?
Ill tell you bout the countries
Youve never been before
Ill go on forever
Forever in a day
Until you lose the interest
Right then I walk away
So I wont let that happen
While we both belong
You can be the singer
And I can be the song
Ill be waiting for you here
When you come calling
Ill be waiting
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here

Hey rabbit, you've had it
Your fingers are in the coin disposal
Hey, worm, you're tunneling out
You would not listen to their proposal
The springs in the mattress
Will never reveal how I entered
In a hospital ward across a billboard
The girl who collects shells
Has gone back to the coast
Hearing voices in car parks
Pull a diamond from your sleeve
Hey, badger, you're punches out
Your mouth is around an aerosol can
Well, they want you to sink
But you stood up and swam
Ideas are like sparrows
They dart down the hall, the chimney and out of the spout
Down a worm hole and back up my mouth
The girl who collects shells
Has gone back to the coast
Hearing voices in car parks
Pull a diamond from your sleeve
No one these days says thank you
When you open doors for them anymore
Well, I made you rich and you made me poor

I apologise a thousand times for every lightyear I'm away
And I'm away quite a lot, but I bear no lies
You're not the first to rob me when you're
Only sick as your secrets, and you're sick
Just stay so close that you're onto me
I could just do with the company
Stay close to me now
I really don't mind, having you near this time, except for twice
And I bear no lies
You're not the first to rob me when you're
Only sick as your secrets, and you're sick
Just stay so close that you're onto me
I could just do with the company
I love you, I hate you, I miss you, you break me
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'd love to desert you, or kiss you, you test me
Why don't you leave me alone?
I apologise a thousand times for every lightyear I'm away
And I'm away, and I'm away
Just stay so close that you're onto me
I could just do with the company

I am the looks, I am the brains
I am the actor
I am the master of my own demise
I am the soul, I am the whole
I am the actor
I'm the disaster who can't read his lines
Please don't leave me now; I've lost my way
And I don't know what it is or what I should say
I've played the role just a little too far
No one ever told me this was hard
I take a walk outside
The only part where I am free to fly
I take it back on that track
I am the actor
Closing the chapter because I'm afraid to
Please don't leave me now; I've lost my way
And I don't know what it is or what I should say
I've played the role just a little too far
No one ever told me this was hard

If we're lucky we feel our lives
Know when the next scene arrives
So often we start in the middle and work our way out
we go to some Grey sky diner for eggs and toast
New York Times or the New York Post
Then we take a ride through the valley of the shadow of death
But even for us New Yorkers, there's a time in every day
The river takes our breath away
[Chorus:]
And the Hudson, it holds the life
We thought we did it on our own
The river roads collect the tolls
For the passage of our souls
Through silence, over woods, through flowers and snow
And past the George Washington Bridge
Down from the trails of Breakneck Ridge
The river's ancient path is sacred and slow
And as it swings through Harlem,
It's every shade of blue
Into the city of the new brand new
And the Hudson, it holds the life
We thought we did it on our own
I thought I had no sense of place or past
Time was too slow, but then too fast
The river takes us home at last
Where and when does the memory take hold
Mountain range in the Autumn cold
And I thought West Point was Camelot in the spring
If you're lucky you'll find something that reflects you
Helps you feel your life protects you
Cradles you and connects you to everything
This whole life I remember as they begged them to itself
Never turn me into someone else
[Chorus x2]

Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
Life is grand
Doesn't it feel good to be alive
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere
Paint the food through bricks and mortar
Bide my time trying to have some fun
Half past ten I drink a little water
Time stands still
I'm seeing my future slip through my hands
Watch the wind whip through desert sand
Then I remember I'm no ordinary man
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere
It's been years since I was a builder
Working with my head and hands
Dreams of crystal, glass and silver
Gold flashing past
So tantalizing, the things that I've seen
I know you know exactly what I mean
Can't ever look back to where you've been
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere
Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
But life is grand
Doesn't it feel good to be alive
To laugh until the tears roll from your eyes
I'll drink to your health from five miles high
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere
Going somewhere
Going somewhere

Sun lights up the day time
You light up my life
The hand that calls you forward
Is the hand that leaves me behind
And I stand on the ocean shore
Like an old black and white movie
Love is, love is lost, again tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight
you've got a book like this
To keep me alive
And if it's not a rainy day
You simply don't go outside
And you're tired of everything
All of the girls and the boys
And you're tired of everything
All of your precious toys
Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight
Sun lights up the daytime
You light up my life
The hand that calls you forward
Is the hand, that leaves me behind
Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight

You stopped
Dead in your tracks
A ghost from the past
Had come back to play
To fuck up your day
But
you spot an exit
A door standing red lit
You leave it to chance
But you're worried cuz you'd rather go up than down
You never like to hear the sound
She makes
You'd rather go up than down
But she's still gonna give and you're still gonna take it
Yeah, you're still gonna take it now
It'll all be better when the clock runs out
(Say it til it's true)
(Say it til it's true)
But I don't want to feel what I felt when I fell back down
(Nothin you could do)
(Nothin you could do)
I could smell the smoke
But could not see the flames
Never thought we'd choke
But I had forgot your name
In the dark
All the wounds we had opened
Seemed more like a reason to bury the pain
The fork
In the paths we had chosen
Has made it too easy to open gate
I know
The deeper it goes
The deeper it goes
The more it unfolds
I get further from ever getting far away
The deeper it goes
The deeper it goes
The lies that were told
I get lost in the storm of the hell I made

Walls gone over the sea
But not for me
Watch now, all will end
Now all that I'm, under a tide
Now I'm, under a tide
Tall hair under it all
Much more than I once had
Over seas

My old wooden chair
In amongst the flames
Alone
I clear my throat to speak
But I cant say a word
Not one
This girl knew my name
On a wooden bridge
Its cold
Woke up on the floor
With poison in my blood
And I'm missing you
My old wooden chair
In amongst the crowd
Alone
If I can't tap my foot
To an honest tune
I'll run
I took a leap
Across the creek
The water rose
Woke up in the sea
With poison in my blood
And I'm missing you

So dramatic when you called
So dramatic going down
So dramatic when you sang
It's the best you ever get
Ever get
Next summer I will return
I'll be back
I'll break your heart
I'll break your heart
When next summer starts
Next summer I will return
I'll be back
You'll crash and burn
Now it's your turn
To crash and burn
And you'll be just like a hurricane
Ruining everything

By the banks of old Poughkeepsie
My love swam with me
Nature's tender bones are breathing
Lungs, each breath's each breeze and
Have you felt it, have you?
I've felt it too and so have you
Summer days, she stays by her window
Her saggy flesh, it sweeps the floor
Down her steps and through her hallway
Comin' out her door and
Have you seen it, have you?
I've seen that too and so have you
Now man holds hands, head, neck shaped cobweb
White oil fills each pore
Again down your steps and through your hallways
Jumpin' out your door and
Have you done it, have you?
I've done that too and so have you
Well, love me tender
V-v-viva Las Vegas and hound dog, all shook up
Heartbreak hotel, Lawdy, miss clawdy
Blue moon, blue suede shoes and
Have you heard it, have you?
I've heard that too and I know for sure
That so have you

Goodbye to my Santa Monica dream
Fifteen kids in the backyard drinking wine
You tell me stories of the sea
And the ones you left behind
Goodbye to the roses on your street
Goodbye to the paintings on your wall
Goodbye to the children we'll never meet
And the ones we left behind
And the ones we left behind
I'm somewhere, you're somewhere
I'm nowhere, you're nowhere
You're somewhere, you're somewhere
I could go there but I don't
Rob's in the kitchen making pizza
Somewhere down in Battery Park
I'm singing songs about the future
Wondering where you are
I could call you on the telephone
But do I really want to know?
You're making love now to the lady down the road
No I don't, I don't want to know
I'm somewhere, you're somewhere
I'm nowhere, you're nowhere
You're somewhere, you're somewhere
I could go there but I don;t

And you can try to fight this all you want
But I won't be there, I won't be there when you're all alone
This new season that brings with it the signs of hope, oh
Now you can't leave me, you can't leave me waiting all alone, alone
And I know, there is some place I can go
Where no one knows my name
And I still remember, you know I can still hear your voice, your voice
Although your silence, your silence still rings so clear
And do you think and do you think I would call just to hear you breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe
You always knew, you always knew that just one word would dry up
All my tears
And I know there is someplace I can go
Where no one knows my name, my name
No one knows my name
Where no one knows my name

The clouds will form a crown,
Circling the rocky mountaintop,
Telling us the rain is coming soon,
As we sail the river up and down
The storm king has borne the seasons all,
Worn them upon his brow,
He guides the watchful boats below,
I am the storm king now.
He is bemused, sometimes delighted,
Sees the trains, the hikers on the hill
In our progress and our industry
May we grow better still.
The storm king has seen us from above,
Rising up on the starboard bow
He knows the turning of the years
I am the storm king now.

Saw the washing on the line
As I lay on the floor
With a heart full of wine
With nothing left to pour
To pour
Silver moon feeling high
Through the window beneath the door
Her eyes are so kind
With nothing left to pour
To pour
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
And you went your way
We're sitting out on the couch
A movie plays without the sound
Words to say left in my mouth
With nothing left to pour
To pour
Silver moon feeling high
Through the window beneath the door
Her eyes are so kind
With nothing left to pour
To pour
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
You stepped into these days
Oh you stepped into
Oh you stepped into
One of these days

Her smiles flashed SOS in that dress of sea anemone skin.
He pinned his heart to his tuxedo it throbbed
And hissed like a rabid jewel.
From the back of the chapel cracked
And crystal our gaze locked in temptation.
A priest with a glass eye sang songs of christian desperation.
The flower girls were all sown up,
They're hanging from the rafters.
Showering your matrimony like a guillotine's laughter.
"dearly beloved we are gathered here to witness,
The sacred union of vibrancy and sickness...
Do you take this man with the diamond skin tie?
And when you are fucking him will you scream dollar signs?
Let me introduce you to a new phrase...
New york noose for a new york slave."
Stained glass eyes wink through mother maty's navelscope...
Who's pupils are watching?
The priest's tongue slips out like a jackal.
Every eye in the audience spinning like a drill.
The groom plucks a key from the rapture tree
And opens her ribcage like a squealing armoire.
Her lungs and liver screaming mercy mercy mercy,
While they re arrange the wires in her heart.
I now pronounce you smiling like a grave,
I now pronounce you a new york slave.
Now every dripping chest wound is getting little guilt feelings,
What about your new life do you crave?
He's your ticket to fame but your his new york slave.

Lately you've been bothered by your friends
We will disturb you, to make you talk again
Try to find the other side of you
The things you hide, what you don't say
We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through
Give you second chances easily
We wait for answers, for hours and years
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
It becomes you, in a strange kind of way
I wonder where you come from
Who you've been
What you gain, if you win
But my guess is right you break like glass
And I wonder where, your god was then
I say no, oh no
I won't let you slip inbetween
I say no, oh no
I won't let you squeeze right through
Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
When she tries
You're changing skin like I change clothes
You're faking it well, but it shows
You say: lately I've been bothered by my friends
They need foregiveness
I need therapy, they say
Better lock up well before they come
With their prayers, and loaded guns
Better lock up well before they come
More than ten years to ignore, what they here for
We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through
We say no, no no no
Since you fall from every throne

Tried to keep you close to me,
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But think that I should have been
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back
Once upon a dear friend, life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we crawl against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back
Hold oho, oho, oho,
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, oh
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other

My house in Budapest
My hidden treasure chest,
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo
You
You
I'd leave it all
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to,
Stop and believe
But for you
You
I'd Leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words
I'll up and run
Oh, to you
You
I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My friends and family
They, don't understand
They fear they'd lose so much
If you take my hand
But, for you
You,
I'd lose it all.
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My house in Budapest
My hidden treasure chest,
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
You
You
I'd leave it all

At least, at least
You're fast asleep
And won't remember yet
How for far too long
Your Now's been numb
We used to dive for it
Now the rest of you's got all the bad from me
The rest of you's got Time
Crushed through the skull and dug out back
Lying in tongues, all be damned
Yawn at the bomb's aftermath
Meaning no harm, apart from that
Concede conceit
So fast asleep
The humans far away
With their songs all wrong
The sad's all gone
They used to dive for it

So alone
I cry but something something
I came through tonight just like you
And all this advice has fallen through
I watch and wait as
Something something
I watch and wait as I let more time decide
And so alone
I cry but i could not
Something
Something

Tragic day, In my mind
Fast car, broken down
Said I think I'm right
But I'm moving slow
His hand they shake, as I go home
Seems like everything, Is gone
Seems I fooled myself, once again
And I drink it all to the rising sun
To say I fooled, myself, once again
I said I fooled myself, once again
I"m gonna close these eyes, for days
She's hour glass slowly fine
See I built these walls but I'll give them down
What's left of me, is on the ground
It seems like everything has gone
Seems I fooled myself once again
I'll drink it all to the rising sun
To say i fooled myself once again
Said I fooled myself, once again
Said I fooled myself, once again
Said I fooled myself, once again
Said I fooled myself, once again.

one night in sudbury ontario
a drunk approached the stage
full of rage, drunk up on his rage
he said 'me and my girl we want to dance slow'
so why don't you sing some songs we know
like maybe... maybe stompin' tom
we played the songs as best we could
three chords, strings, dirty wood
and pushed them past the smoke the whole night long
hey, hey what's the deal?
this was supposed to be the real thing
but we're angry now and yelling now
we're not hearing anything
that the other person is saying at all
one night in sudbury ontario
one night in riviere du loup
i looked out through the smoke and swore i saw you
too many nights
too many drinks
too many times
where i didn't think of you
i didn't think of you
hey, hey what's the deal?
this was supposed to be the real thing
but we're angry now and yelling now
we're not hearing anything
that the other person is saying at all

Well I've been down to Georgia
I've seen the streets in the West
I've driven down the 90, hell I've seen America's best
I've been through the Rockies, I've seen Saskatoon
I've driven down the highway 1 just hopin' that I'd see you soon
'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I've never been to Alaska, but I can tell you this,
I've been to Lincoln, Nebraska and hell you know it ain't worth shit
I've been through Nova Scotia, Sydney to Halifax
I'll never take any pictures cause I know I'll just be right back
'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I've seen a palace in London, I've seen a castle in Wales
But I'd rather wake up beside you and breathe that ol' familiar smell
I never thought you could leave me, I figured I was the one
But I understand your sadness so I guess I should just hold my tongue
'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I know that we're takin' chances, you told me life was a risk
But I just have one last question
Will it be my heart or will it be his?
I'm comin' home

There's always something to hide
There's always someone to lead on with you
Obligated Rewind
Evidently proves that I don't need you
She said 'Oh please, you're obsessed!'
I said she looked over-dressed
She deffo didn't like that no
She said 'I'm feeling like it's brewing up
When you say that you don't need me
And you are nothing without me'
But Babe
You know I've tried and failed
But you
Just don't know how it feels
To lose
Something you never had and never will
There's always some kid to snide
They took my mother at 13
And patched her fickly eyes
Evidently proved that i don't need you or noone
She said 'It's you i detest!'
I said she looked underslept
She deffo didn't like that no
She said 'I'm feeling like it's brewing up
When you say that you don't need me
And you are nothing without me'
But Babe
You know I've tried and failed
But you
Just don't know how it feels
To lose
Something you never had and never will
But Babe
You know I've tried and failed
But you
Just don't know how it feels
To lose
Something you never had and never will
I'm a pacifier, I'm a pacifier

Leave the body, leave the mind
Leave the body, leave the mind
Every promise, every place behind
I just happen to feel so alone
For today for all days to come
I just wanna be, wanna be gone
I just wanna be, wanna be gone
Leave the quiet, leave the night
Leave the quiet, leave the night
Broken feelings of dreams out of sight
Pictures in your head at night
For tonight, for all nights to come
Erased for good and always gone
Erased for good and always gone
Leave the city, leave the cold
Leave the city, leave the cold
Young people far too old
Let me cross a very fine line
For today, for a lifetime
For today, for a lifetime
Leave the body, leave the mind
Let me leave the body, leave the mind
Every promise, every place behind
I just happen to feel so alone
For today, for all days to come
For today, for all days to come
I just wanna be, wanna be gone

Well, I dreamed I went out wandering
I heard promises become fables forgotten
I saw bridges stretching out across the water
And towers pushing taller
I knew my reality was clearly defined
By the fences put up around my mind
I watched them thicken into walls over time
Taller than any borderline
I saw civilizations deemed insignificant
I saw people?s history tattooed upon their skin
I saw families taken from their land
Dynasty shattered and stolen
And I asked when is the revolution
I asked when is the revolution
And all the burdens the centuries accrue
That get passed along to every generations youth
And all the allegories told in lewd truth
I watched them grow wild and spread like a flu
I saw the rise of an untamed industry
And I watched machines print a paper economy
I saw my own self stand right in front of me
And I didn't do a thing
I saw poisons pushed in the street
And prescription pills mingling in the mezzanine
With a whole wealth of doctors and pharmaceutical companies
Still poor people were dying from disease
And I asked when is the revolution
I asked when is the revolution
I asked when is the revolution
I asked when is the revolution
And I broke down at the break of dawn
And saw looming in the clouds above the Pentagon
As he re-lives the holocaust as strong as the parkin' on
Visions [Incomprehensible] Vietnam
And I stood silent upon the flooded levee
Stared at the ruins of a merchant city
And the president who came to dine with the noble, he
He didn't do a thing
I saw three ships come sailing in
Through the passage of the Caribbean
I saw children coming home in coffins
Millions marching on Washington
And I asked when is the revolution
I asked when is the revolution
I asked when, when is the revolution
I asked when is the revolution

I shot my heart
To let you go
I shot it down for you
But you don't know
I let my soul grow cold
And it's all
It's all I could
Since then I've been
Reckoning the scars I left on your skin
I've been recognizing the bullets
I used for the execution
They went straight through me
And into you
And that's where they are stuck in
Since then I've been
Reckoning the scars I left on your skin
I turned myself into
A different kind of me to be able to
Set my pride aside
And it's all it's all I could
I'm turning myself in
Crawling down in my coffin
I'm turning myself in
Crawling down in my coffin

In time all clear
I'm alone with the thought of it
high outside
it's there and it's gone again
counting it fast and keeping it slowly
time all clear
I'm alone with the thought of it
When we see you
we believe it in the end
all things go
When I see it
I believe it in the end
all things go
Oh some things get lost
get lost and go missing
wandering off in time
counting too fast
keeping things slowly
slowly in time
When I see it
I believe it in the end
all things go
When we see them
we will believe them in the end
all things go

And I will find the true intent and I will find myself
So take good care of me, for less and for all
I will fall for all your words
I will find the way
To find myself again but when will you follow me
Hearts ache under the stress of you
But I don't even know the true intent
Who ever we're all in a fine mess
How ever you finally break
To find myself again but when will you follow
Decisions an eye full
And I confess

And so long, mistress sings
So long, I can't wait
To my love, wait one more
So long, mistress sings
So long, my fate has changed
It's been deranged
So long to these kite strings
So long, I've been saved before
I'm saved once more
I call upon my daring
I call upon, I can't taste anymore
I can't waste anymore

I heard there's a brand new zoo in Thailand
So I hitch hike on a private flight and got there, man, fast
I've greased every palm from A to Z
Hey mister wanna date with me
I know what I've got to do, and I'll do it
From the day I was born
Always been my stepping stone
I come from a long line of people
Who never waited in life
I've got a dumb dance inside my pants man
I've watched all the latest shows on Bing Bong
I rode a gift horse into town
Free subscriptions all around
You look like you could use a night in heaven
We're so in love
Everywhere we go it's walking underwater
Suddenly I'll be playing
All the tears are music to my ears
'Cause I'm a fancy man
Fancy man
I'm a fancy man
Fancy man
Fancy man
I looked into my eyes and I saw order
An endless row of flowers along the border
It's no ordinary tragedy
Where the credits roll on the top of me
First I'm going to do it, then I'll do it
'Cause love's the yes
Within the yes
And everyone's walking underwater
Oh and the fire was [?] with fists
And maybe [?]
'Cause I'm a fancy man
Fancy man
I'm a fancy man
Fancy man
Fancy man
Sometimes I get to thinking
Is this fancy thinking?
Is this a fancy thought?
I'm pretty sure it's not

I don't
Owe me any money
You don't
Owe me a thing
When we
Drink beer
Dragonflies appear
Dragonflies appear

My home has no door
My home has no roof
My home has no windows
It ain't water proof
My home has no handles
My home has no keys
If you're here to rob me
There's nothing to steal
A la maison
Dans ma maison
C'est là que j'ai peur
Home is not a harbour
Home home home
Is where it hurts
My home has no heart
My home has no veins
If you try to break in
It bleeds with no stains
My brain has no corridors
My walls have no skin
You can lose your life here

What if I did not love you?
Where would that leave me
Would I wonder through the avenues
Under a pall of misery
Would I be face down in the gutter
With cheap whiskey on my breath
The lonely life of a writer
Whose words could not pay his debts
Singin' please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I've been blinded completely
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy
What if we became strangers?
Would you notice my face in a crowd?
And could you hear the sorrow in my voice?
Helplessly crying your name out loud
Would I be searching for a savior?
Burned and burning with regret
The lonely life of a writer
Only if one last desperate request
Singin' please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I've been blinded completely
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy
I've been on the lam
Being hunted, somethin' fierce
They say time and tide, it waits for no man
But I was just hopin'
These storm filled skies would clear
Please don't, please don't pass me by
(Please don't, please don't pass me by)
Please don't, please don't pass me by
(Please don't, please don't pass me by)
Please don't, please don't pass me by
I am alive, oh can't you see?
That I am pleading for your mercy

Tonight the city's like a Pac man board
I wanna know how many power pellets till I get to your door
All the angled streets and the blinking lights
How many of my clothes on your floor?
How many of my clothes on your floor?
Oh you know who you are
Just look out your window the ghosts aren't that far
There's smoke on the island and all five boroughs are watching
There's smoke on the island and all five boroughs are watching
When the world stops
I will ride on you
Your fingers are approaching my moves
I'm on a joy stick ride
I'm moving on to my next three lives
And I'm a quarter junkie and I'm thirsty for you
I'm thirsty for you

Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will help
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
But the sun
Everybody has their own bubble inside
Waiting for the show
That will set their world on fire
Everybody has their own eyes to dry
Every body except mine
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will help
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
But the sun
Everybody has their own smile to hide
Waiting for the blow
That will steal one of their lives
Everybody has their own blood to wipe
Every body except mine
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will help
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
But the sun
But the sun
Burning fist
That you miss
Inside of you
But the sun
Burning gift
Slowly drifts
Away from you
(Le soleil de ton pays
Est le même que celui du pays ennemi oh)
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will help
Kfir
Nobody will
Nobody will run after you
But the sun

Ones the most calming tune the others the giving
Ones the softest calming lagoon
The others he's dancing
Ones the I's the O's and the rings
While the others the movement
Ones the sway it slips and sings
The mantles and the blankets
Its four and four time to sing some more
It eight and eight time to celebrate
Better not be late
Don't ya miss it

VERSE 1
I'm thinking about What you said
As you walked out the door
Your words stuck in my head
And they're circling like birds and stars
CHORUS
You said
My heart is no weapon, in fact
My heart is a gate
My heart is open and unafraid
and its waiting for
you to find your way in
VERSE 2
When we're old
will you lean into
the open mouth kiss offered to you
on the porch swing
under a blanket of stars?
CHORUS
(you said) My heart is no weapon
My heart is a gate
My heart is open
My heart is afraid
REFRAIN
does this love know enough to bend low into the winds?
does this love know its even love at all?
what's to say tha this love won't fail like others before it?
i say stop, too many questions to pile onto one little song
REPEAT VERSE 1 + CHORUS

Behold the hit music revolution

Shes gonna blow
Her faulty circuitry exposed
Although you feel ashamed
Im sure she seemed
So real from far away
Just when you get up your nerve
To take her at her word
Hiding out somewhere safe
Shell set that hook inside your mouth
You just wait, shes a fake
Shes on a roll, shes the perfect picture
Of complete control
But underneath her stage
Shes scared to death
You might mean what you say
Just when you get up your nerve
To take her at her word
Shell draw you in for one last taste
And when its time she will deny
What she embraced, shes a fake
And she will take all that you will let her
But you will never get her
'Cause youre the runner up, you better learn
To keep your big mouth shut
You can talk all day
But youre gonna leave
Exactly as you came
Just when you get up your nerve
To take her at her sorry word
Its an awful truth you face
Nonetheless you better learn
When to cut bait
Shes a fake

Rainclouds, moon shines, I know
Sun burns, stars earn shadows,
sing baby brown eyes
You give me everything to try
I'm following grey skies, grey
Skies lead me lost in the night
We'll dance till were tired
Eat till were full
With a guaranteed window over some where to go
My room needs no 4 walls to cushion the blow, lets go
Maybe you're right maybe I'm wrong
Climb till your pacified
Fight till your strong
We'll dance till were tired
Eat till were full
With a guaranteed window over some where to go
My room needs no 4 walls to cushion the blow, lets go
We'll talk till were empty drink till were blue
You can dare me to race you you can pay me my dues
Your maybe's no answer, 'cause maybe its you, lets go
Dance till were tired eat till were strong
A guaranteed window where nothing can go wrong
Dance till were tired eat till were full
We've a guaranteed window over somewhere to go, somewhere to go
Dance till were tired drink till you fall
A guaranteed window and no weakness at all
Dance till were weary

I built my house of reeds upon a marsh in Elise
My father was released a day's walk from San Denise
We buried him beneath the bone-white sands of San Denise
Silence of an airborne night
Push high above the roof
Daughters of the Red lights blind
The icy works of art
The city lights and restless nights
Go once upon the Lord
You and I will lie beside the fire sparked from boards
It's yours

We burned all our clothes
Blew Yopo up our nose
We're a young and lazy ol' wild boar
Yep
We followed the stork
It led us to camp
We didn't get lost but we lost a chance
1901 was the year of the bleedin' horse
And I was lonely, lonely
1902 the Devil sucked off the moon
Please hold me, please hold me
My ear to your chest,
Your back to the ground,
Please move mama
Please make a sound
That war party's lookin' for you
And lookin' for me
Damn, damn, we weren't scared
Just unprepared
So we followed the caw
'Till our eyes were locked in,
We became her and she became them
And then
I heard the voice of heaven
Sayin' don't be scared of anything
I heard the voice of the land,
The beautiful land, sing
I recognize you mother
In a little playful touch from death
As above so below
You're in control of the rest
Then the six nippled frog
Ran across the golden moss
Followin' behind us, behind us
And the W.A.C.
Was pointing Remingtons at the trees
They couldn't find us
Can't find us

We all know
That the wind blows
And the moon glows
And our lungs grow
We belong to the floating hand
That's made by some animals
And we all dance so
We can let go
And remove clothes
And trade loans
Like the type of tongue that roots from your breast
And it shakes your pretty little clavicle
A good friend
Is walking
To a homeland
And inside land
And to him I said
You can leave your eyes at the horizon's dead door
'Cause you won't need them anywhere
The children
Spend the dawning
And the morning
Disappearing
They reappeared as a seed of love
You know, the hard parts are vegetables
We all know

Hey are you really gonna take off
Are you really gonna fly sitting in the pilot seat
Hey are you really gonna fight fires
Are you really gonna drive your engine in the morning
Once in a while you think of all the dreams you filed away
One life there's no time like the present here and now
One love there's no time like the present time
Hey are you gonna be a soldier
Are you gonna fight a war and save all the good souls
Hey are you gonna start a revolution
Are you gonna spread the word are you gonna change the world
Once in a while you think of all the dreams you filed away
One life there's no time like the present here and now
One love there's no time like the present time
All the nights we've shared familiar faces there
It's amazing what you get when you give
One life there's no time like the present here and now
One love there's no time like the present time
Once in a while you think of all the dreams you filed away

Eight weeks in the city,
And you've never looked so pale,
They say the pure of heart don't stand a chance,
And you'd better learn to swim,
Cause there will be rainy days.
I'm blinded the brake lights,
Well there's nothing moving here,
And all your burning questions, they just get answered with another one,
And there's no help at all.
So question me no questions,
It's a pointless enterprise,
You ask and I'll only tell you what I think you want to hear,
Oh mind the whitest lies.
Cause the truth,
Well it's for students for philosophy,
And faith is for losers like us,
And secrets are for people who intend to get away with being in the wrong,
So don't you breath a word.
But save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh..
Save you breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
Save your breath.
Will you listen to their bleeding hearts?
Pretend to show concern,
And so we glanced our watches and join in as everybody sings,
Oh what have we become?
Will you hop a train to anywhere?
It sure ain't no place like home,
Where there are no strangers,
Only people you don't wanna know,
But before the crying out loud..
Just save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh.
Save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, oh.
Save your breath,
Save your breath.
So meet me by the station,
And bring a change of heart,
And smile away the old country as we watch it disappear
And pull these years apart.
And scatter from the window,
To settle on the fields,
And tell yourself a hundred times that forever starts today,
And think how good it feels.
To save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh.
Save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
Save your breath,
To save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh.
Save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, oh.
Save your breath,
Save, oh
Save your breath,
(Don't waste your breath on treading water anymore)
Save your breath,
(There must be something you consider to be worth fighting for)
Save your breath,
(Waste your breath on running circles, round and round and round)
Save your breath,
(And talking about it when it cannot get you down)
Save your breath,
(Nobody want's that much we just want more)
Save your breath,
(Don't waste your breath on treading water anymore)
Save your breath,
(Don't waste your breath on running circles, round and round and round and round)
Save your breath,
Save your breath.

Garrison Starr - Beautiful in Los Angeles
You are brilliant, but
You're amazing, what
Whatever I say, we'll be so safe
If my bubble pops
If my world gets rocked
I can say you could be anyone today
Are you still beautiful in los angeles
It's been so long, I can't handle it
Does it really make any difference
Cause I'm so far away
And you will never change
Between eastern time
And really predictable lines
You make a pretty good case for
That lost look on your face
Tell me are you curious
Will you be curious enough to stay awake
When you finally feel your heart break
And I'm so beautiful in los angeles
When it's been so long you can't handle it
Will it really make any difference
Cause I'm so far away
And you will never change
I never get the chance to rehearse
And I can't explain it, for what it's worth
Will I ever get the chance to be true
Alone in a room with you
Where whatever we say
We're so safe, so safe
Are you still beautiful in los angeles
It's been so long I can't handle it
Will it ever make any difference
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
Will we ever change

Worlds on end
Seen through
A rocket window screen
Millions left to roam
Engines burn
Beautiful and bright
Always bring me home
If galaxies
Are places you've
Never been too far
Suns will fade
Both blind and lead the way
Home where you are
Away away
Away away
The receiver
In my rocket ship
Always stays in tune
To the right waveband
In galaxies unknown
Further suns in bloom

Another clime cries
brings out some weird, vivid sights
and my antenna
try hard to simplify
So I run 'til the sea surrounds me
And the palms cover...
You're so tempered
That's why I don't know, I'm in my mind
I just intended to
make a turn, lost in the sun
So I run 'til the sea surrounds me
And the palms cover...
The sun comes down into the sea
The sun comes down into the sea
The sun comes down into the sea
So beach house
I guess my brain is nearly frozen
in your velvet sky
there's a glimpse, a warmer motion
The sun comes down into the sea
The sun comes down into the sea
The sun comes down into the sea

January starts without much sympathy,
just like every dog that's let loose right in front of me.
& this time next year things will settle slowly,
like a rush of blood,
the fear my heart beholds of me.
Your better days, are yet to come,
to silence fights, the beating drums.
the eloquent, the yet to know, the will it hurt,
the will it hold?
And although this rain has lasted us quite long enough,
it's been several months without the sleep to comfort us.
& can you hear the dogs? They're howling down below.
It's a fervent ground you can feel it,
but you will never know.
That better days, are yet to come.
To silence fights, the beating drums,
the eloquence, the yet to know,
the "will it hurt?", the "will it hold?"
This night won't satisfy me,
This fear won't bring me to the ground.
I know you're scared of hiding,
I know you're aching to be found.
I know you're aching to be found.
I know you're aching to be-
This night won't satisfy me,
This fear won't bring me to the ground
I know you're scared of hiding
I know you're aching to be found.
I know you're aching to be found.
I know you're aching to be-

ONE TWO THREE!
THANK YOU!
stumbling from the alleyway walking a vulture,
or is the vulture walking you?
mumbling for a driver for your toothless limousine,
holding that diamond leash like the sabertooth queen.
gurgling for a chariot to the twilight ball,
to get back you'll have to crawl.
smile big now through that kaleidoscope cut,
blush blush blush to earn that crush.
yeah we're on the run
you're married to the vultures.
bah-bah-bah-nana-uh uh
you're married to the vultures.
i don't want to laugh until you're dead.[x2]
back at home you just want to be alone
but pick up the phone cause i'm listening to every word you say!
i'm in your vultures beak as he turns his head to speak, he says
"now oh teen ruby queen, give us a scream!
do you know the difference between a memory and fog?
and do you know the difference between a laugh and a sob?
cause for all your charms
and graces you're not hollywood starlet
you're just a fuck film harlot.
when you said eternal life what you meant was eternal head
and now all your suitors wish you were dead.
cause there's nothing like a breath of fresh air,
or tentacles in your hair,
or the dead stare of a sagging skull!
yeah we're fucking built
you're married to the vultures.
bah-bah-bah-nana-uh uh
you're married to the vultures.
i don't want to laugh until you're dead.[x2]
you're married married married to the vultures baby.
so polish that poison snatch,
you know it ain't gonna last much longer.
One Two Three! Bye!

Heart, cover your tracks
The blood that you spill will wash what you lack
Soul, sew up your wounds
Test out your engine. Give it some room
Mind, pick up your pace
Capture the thoughts you always chase
Soul, open your wings
Lift this cage higher than any dream
Cover your tracks
Sew up your wounds
Pick up your pace
Open your wings
Heart, flesh out your webs
The past that was tangled will unwrap and shed
Soul, sing out your songs
Clear out your throat. Belt it out strong
Cover your tracks
Sew up your wounds
Pick up your pace
Open your wings
Cover your tracks
Cover your tracks

Your voice
Morphine in my ear
I see you down there
Holding on to me

You're holding on to this thread
Connecting you to me
I'm filled with laughing gas and polluted air
This silk lasso 'round my neck
It's pulling me down
Down gently
Gently
I'm softly exhaling
You give me release
I'm softly exhaling
You give me release
You leave me deflated
You give me release
My own private Balloon Ranger
You know what I need
You know what I need
You know what I need

Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's ok I know nothing's wrong, nothing
Hi yo I got plenty of time
Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight
Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time, before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be, where I'll be
Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head
Ah ooh

Come and lay here beside me
I'll tell you how I feel
There's a secret inside me
I'm ready to reveal
To have you close
Embrace your heart with my love
Over and over
These are things that I promise
My promise to you
* For all of my life
You are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
All of my life
You are the one
I give to you my greatest love
For all of my life
Let me lay down beside you
There's something you should know
I pray that you decide to
Open your heart and let me show
Enchanted worlds of fairy tales
A wonderland of love
These are things that I promise
My promise to you
* For all of my life
You are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
All of my life
You are the one
I give to you my greatest love
For all of my life
All of my love
With all of my heart
These are things that I promise
*For all of my life
You are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
All of my life
You are the one
I give to you my greatest love
*For all of my life
You are the one
I will love you faithfully forever
All of my life
You are the one
I give to you my greatest love
For all of my life

I'm high and I'm happy and I'm free
I got my whole heart
Laid out right in front of me
And I finally can see
The way it's always been
The need for peace
Starts from within
So I leave my possessions to the wind
And I'm done with ever wanting anything
Well I can die satisfied
No desires do I hide
Not today, not today
Nor for the next one thousand lives
I want to be a little seahorse
I want to be a little seahorse
A little seahorse
I want to be a little seahorse
I want to be a little seahorse
I want to be a little seahorse

MRS LYONS
HELLO, MRS J. HOW ARE YOU?
MRS J.? ANYTHING WRONG?
MRS JOHNSTONE
I HAD IT ALL WORKED OUT.
WITH ONE MORE BABY WE COULD HAVE MANAGED.
BUT NOT WITH TWO, THE WELFARE HAVE ALREADY BEEN ON TO ME.
MRS LYONS
TWINS? YOU'RE EXPECTING TWINS?
NARRATOR
HOW QUICKLY AN IDEA, PLANTED, CAN
TAKE ROOT AND GROW INTO A PLAN.
THE THOUGHT CONCEIVED IN THIS VERY ROOM
GREW AS SURELY AS A SEED, IN A MOTHER'S WOMB
MRS LYONS
GIVE ONE OF THEM TO ME.
PLEASE, MRS JOHNSTONE. PLEASE.
MRS JOHNSTONE
ARE Y'.... ARE Y' THAT DESPERATE TO HAVE A BABY?
MRS LYONS
EACH DAY I LOOK OUT FROM THIS WINDOW
I SEE HIM WITH HIS FRIENDS, I HEAR HIM CALL,
I RUSH DOWN BUT AS I FOLD MY ARMS AROUND HIM
HE'S GONE. WAS HE EVER THERE AT ALL?
I'VE DREAMED OF ALL THE PLACES I WOULD TAKE HIM
THE GAMES WE'D PLAY THE STORIES I WOULD TELL
THE JOKES WE'D SHARE, THE CLOTHING I WOULD MAKE HIM
I REACH OUT. BUT AS I DO, HE FADES AWAY.
MRS JOHNSTONE
IF MY CHILD WAS RAISED I A PALACE LIKE THIS ONE
HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY WHERE
HIS NEXT MEAL WAS COMIN' FROM
HIS CLOTHING WOULD BE
SUPPLIED BY GEORGE HENRY LEE
MRS LYONS
HE'D HAVE ALL HIS OWN TOYS
AND A GARDEN TO PLAY IN
MRS JOHNSTONE
HE COULD MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE
WITHOUT THE NEIGHBOURS COMPLAININ'
MRS LYONS
SILVER TRAYS TO TAKE MEALS ON
MRS JOHNSTONE
A BIKE WITH BOTH WHEELS ON?
MRS LYONS
AND HE'D SLEEP EVERY NIGHT
IN A BED OF HIS OWN
MRS JOHNSTONE
HE WOULDN'T GET INTO FIGHTS
HE'D LEAVE MATCHES ALONE
AND YOU'D NEVER FIND HIM
EFFIN' AND BLINDIN'
AND WHEN HE GREW UP
HE COULD NEVER BE TOLD
TO STAND AND QUEUE UP
FOR HOURS ON END AT THE DOLE
HE'D GROW UP TO BE
MRS LYONS / MRS JOHNSTONE
A CREDIT TO ME
MRS JOHNSTONE
TO YOU?
MRS LYONS
YES.
MRS JOHNSTONE
I WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO SEE HIM EVERY DAY,
WOULDN'T I?
MRS LYONS
OF COURSE
MRS JOHNSTONE
AN'.... AN' YOU WOULD LOOK AFTER HIM,
WOULDN'T Y'?
MRS LYONS
I'D KEEP HIM WARM IN THE WINTER
AND COOL WHEN IT SHINES
I'D PULL OUT HIS SPLINTERS
WITHOUT MAKING HIM CRY
I'D ALWAYS BE THERE
IF HIS DREAM BECAME A NIGHTMARE
MRS JOHNSTONE & MRS LYONS
MY CHILD
MY CHILD
MY CHILD
MRS LYONS
MRS J. WE MUST MAKE THIS A BINDING AGREEMENT.
NARRATOR
IN THE NAME OF JESUS, THE THING WAS DONE,

THERE'S A PACT BEEN SEALED,
THERE'S A DEAL BEEN BORN.

Love her from the get-go
Pick her up from Heathrow
Whenever she needs me
Watch her on the West End
Pepper up her best friends
Whenever she needs me
She was a different league
When I was nothing much
Meet her when the tour's up
Hug her like her Mother would
Whenever she needs me
Snog her in the kitchen
Dance with her to Lemonworld
Whenever she needs me
She was a different league
When I was nothing much

Climb
Is all we know
When thaw
Is not below us
No, can't grow up
In that iron ground
Claire, all too sore for sound
Bet
Is hardly shown
Scraped
Across the foam
Like they stole it
And oh, how they hold it
Claire, we nearly forfeit
I' I'm growing like the quickening hues
I' I'm telling darkness from lines on you
Over havens fora full and swollen morass, young habitat!
All been living alone, where the ice snap and the hold clast are known
Home
We're savage high
Come
We finally cry
Oh and we don it
Because it's right
Claire, I was too sore for sight
I' we're sewing up through the latchet greens
I' un-peel keenness, honey, bean for bean
Same white pillar tone as with the bone street sand is thrown where she stashed us at
All been living alone, where the cracks at in the low part of the stoning

I feel your sorrow chasing tomorrow
There is no distance in your absence
If you call the monsters they will appear
Like I disappear Blackout
There is resistance behind enemy lines
There goes the hatred bursting through the fabric
If you call the monsters they will appear
Like I disappear Blackout
You are here
You are here
You are here

The sun inside your eyes sends me impossibly
Through seasons spilling fluid time like arteries of gold
Beside this tree of oak and moss most innocently
The sedentary song describes our willingness to lie
Between your red and golden skin most innocently
Together like two meadows one, too soon our course is run
In softness as in stone we find regretably
The solitary song describes our willingness to die

Dogs they make up the dark surrounding mountains
They move towards the sea
Light that shines from your womb is blinding mountains
They move towards the sea

Button up that shirt you're supposed to wear.
Don't forget your airline ticket or to brush your hair,
Show that family that you care.
But could you wear something that celebrates
Everything you love, and maybe what your family hates.
'Cause that might be what it takes.
It's your fire, it's your soul, you shouldn't have to go.
It's your fire, it's your soul, you shouldn't have to go.
First thing they'll say's take off your shoes,
And they'll say they want your story, but they get confused,
By all those words you use.
A year ago your car went off a cliff,
And you saw an angel in midair who said you'd live.
Well, that's a story you can give.
It's your fire, it's your soul, you shouldn't have to go.
Your fire, your soul, you shouldn't have to go.
And they'll say, "You're family, you belong to us.
You can stay at home and have our love and trust,
But any day now one of us could die,
And if we make you suffer don't you want to find out why,
'Cause we love to watch you try,
With your fire, your soul, your soul.
It's your fire, it's your fire, it's your fire.
Then you'll fly home and get the flu,
And you'll keep staring at the ground, you always do,
When they get their time with you.
You are not a punching bag, my dear,
I think your darkest day should have some light this year,
I think you should stay right here.
It's your fire, it's your soul, you shouldn't have to go.
It's your fire, it's your soul, you shouldn't have to go.

All I have or should
Want to be but never could
It's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out
It's coming out, it's coming out my heart
To spoil my soul with fire
All my eyes can see is
Born out of your imagery
It's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out
It's coming out, it's coming out my heart
To scorch the earth with fire
Tell me who you really love
Tell me who you really love
Tell me who you really love
Who are you to take over my mind
With your eyes on me
All for you I am climbing the sky
Of golden green
Angel green and blue
I'm gonna leave my mind with you
I know, I see, I wanna be just free (It's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out)
I know, it craves, it's running through my veins
To spoil my soul with fire
Tell me who you really love
Tell me who you really love
Who are you to take over my mind
With your eyes on me
All for you I am climbing the sky
Of golden green

Stopped pretending.
Happy ending.
Everything I ever wanted stands in front of me.
I have lost my dreams.
I have lost my dreams.
Now they say I told the truth.
Life beyond the burden of proof:
Paper thin blue skies and windless fields.
I have lost my dreams.
I have lost my dreams.
Traffic crawling,
Life is moving,
Up through stately trees into their green leaves.
Find a new dream.
Find a new dream.
I have lost my dreams.
I have lost my dreams.

Today the world is a top
Spinning on the devils fingers
Spinning on the devils fingers
Spinning on the devils fingers
We've gotta use our hands
We've gotta take it back one day
Today the world...
I was hoping for a hole in the clouds
But I found myself a hole in the ground
I don't see the sun no more
But I can feel the rain
And I was born to take it all back one day

Bound for trouble from the start
I've been walking through this old world in the dark
All along right by my side
There you were shining, my ray of light
So, I sing lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
Lover come back, lover come back to me
I'll never be as good as I'd like to be
Eternally restless refusing to believe
But I think that we missed our connection
I wanted to feel your affection
Until my final days
I sing lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
Lover come back, lover come back to me
I am warm enough yet I still shiver
I am fed but still I starve
You know me I am the great misgiver
Always waiting on the clouds to part
I sing lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
So lover come back, lover come back to me
Lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
So lover come back, lover come back to me

So abruptly
Saw death on a sunny snow
For every life
Forgoe the parable
Seek the light
My knees are cold
Running home, running home
Running home, running home
Go find another lover
To bring a, to string along
With all your lies
You're still very lovable
I toured the light
so many foreign roads
For Emma, forever ago

She wasn't ever obliged
To lift me a buckle or rise
And once her eyes covered with flies
The pain she no longer disguised
Windows that I'm terrorized in time
Never to ignite
There was once a time beside
It holds each one in light
'Til the market left dry
How long she's been by my side
But at last, the stable's retired

Fraying of threads reminds how memory fades
Terrible how predictable the monkeys we became
Things we forget then learn again each day
write it sing it paint it so that no can take it away from you
Is where you lay your head where you lay your heart?
terrible fires that we started
all fears were quieted
all things made possible
with woman as bridge
are you waiting for the world?
or are you closed to it?
are you waiting for the world?
are you open to it?
Bridge over my body, bed as abyss
tangling of legs, climbing hips
sweetest fruit tasted in a kiss
all fears were quieted
all things made possible
with woman as bridge
Find whatever piece of happiness you can find and hold onto it.
Find whatever piece of happiness you can find and hold onto it.
Woman as bridge, Woman as Well
Two trees Anchored, Standing Tall
Space for mystery

I am loosing my mind over you
and I'm so sorry but soon I'll have to go
'cause I won't shine the way you want me to shine
I'm gray, I'm pale and nothing more
I'll rip my heart out of my chest
I'll spit it out and try to forget
and I'll keep my hands away
and pretend as if I had nothing left to say

Beautiful girl, you're a lovely picture
Beautiful girl, you're a gorgeous mixer
Of all that lives under those big blue skies
My heart cries, beautiful girl
You're a dazzling icon, beautiful girl
I could never travel if I have you
You'd be my dream come true
There may be blonds and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed
And you're over sweet sixteen
Oh, beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call the preacher
What can I do but give my heart to you
If I could write like poets do
I sang my songs that's all to you
Beautiful girl, you're my desire
But when I search for words of praise
I'm like a schoolboy in a daze
When you come my way, this is all that I can say
Can't you see my heart just cry
Beautiful girl, you're a dazzling icon
Beautiful girl, I could never travel if I have you
You'd be my dream come true
There may be blonds and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed
And you're over sweet sixteen
Oh, beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call the preacher
What can I do but give my heart to you
Beautiful girl

You took the wind from my sails
And left me there to drift away
I woke up in the morning
Stripped of everything
Oh sweet lord its time its time
We moved along
Tonight I'll put the good
Back in goodbye
If the boat don't float and she don't go
This girls gonna blow the morning
I'll turn to face the cold cold sea
And will this ship around
And I'll swallow level tears
Of broken promises
But the calm prevailed with
No whistle to her name
And I could see whose name
Was on your mind
I heard sighs from a million muted
Turncoats at attention
And tonight I'll put the good
Back in goodbye
If the boat don't float and she don't go
This girls gonna blow the morning
I'll turn to face the cold cold sea
And will this ship around
And swallow level tears
Of broken promises
What freedom owes the devil
To the devil I'll be due
I'll walk right down to hell before
I fall in love with you
I'll take this broken heart of mine
And pin it to the floor
And tonight ill put the good
Back in goodbye
If the boat don't float and she don't go
This vessels gonna blow the morning
I'll turn to face the cold cold sea
And will this ship around
And tonight I'll put the good in goodbye

i keep recalling us at the airport
saying good night for the last time me
i managed a smile as you made nervous
say hey, hey never mind
every song sounds like a love song
every kiss feels like your first
i'm afraid i'm losing you
from better than bad back to worse
hey i never told you you're my judy garland
me i'm your cyclone
calling out to kansas but you were never home
every song sounds like a love song
every kiss feels like your first
i'm afraid i'm losing you
from better than bad back to worse

She comes from Ireland
She's very beautiful
I come from Brisbane
I'm quite plain
She's from the mountains, so close to heaven
Clouds on her shoes, stars on her chest
I love Lee Remick, she's a darling
She was in The Omen with Gregory Peck
She got killed, what the heck
Her eyes are like gems
She's an actress for Screen Gems
I love Lee Remick, she's a darling
Her hair's red, but it's not dye
If I touched her, I know I'd want to cry
My life is desperation, but it's only infatuation
I love Lee Remick, she's a darling

I am
a soul I float amongst the fjords
and I am creating fire which will find you
Your eyes I see the ocean deep in your eyes
Now I
I know that nothing here can harm me now
I rest inside the hope of odds to come
Then end up in harmony
Always please tell me who will fall and who has fallen
Who hides and wants to be forgotten
My eyes I see the path now clearly to you
Now I
I see the dream is now becoming true
This well, it overflows
My hope, my life
Then end up in harmony
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
Aah Aah Aaah Aaaaaaahhhh
I am
A soul I float amongst the fjords
And I am creating fire which will find you
My eyes
I see the path now clearly to you
Now I
I see the dream is now becoming true
This well it overflows
My hope, my life
Then end up in harmony
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh

The daughter of a man was a mammal
She wore the mark of fire and of flame
Though they're both the same
Born onto the age of the golden
Oh that golden age of endless
Loss and endless gain
Now because my lips have split
All the little children they are hiding in front
In the middle and in the behind
And because my nose has froze
But I can keep on smelling
I could smell my little day away
I could smell my whole day away
Now because my teeth don't bite
I could take them out dancing
I could take my little teeth out
And I show them a real good time
Well, a real good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time, good time, a good time
A real good time

You say love is what you put into it
You say that I'm losing my will
Don't you know that you're all that I think about?
You make up a half of the whole
You say that it's hard to commit to it
You say that it's hard standing still
Don't you know that I spend all my nights
Counting backwards the days 'til I'm home?
If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home
I say that we're right in the heart of it
A love only we understand
I will bend every light in this city
And make sure they're shining on you
If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home
When life takes its own course
Sometimes we just don't get to choose
I'd rather be there next to you
Promise you'll wait for me, wait for me
Wait 'til I'm home
All I have is this feeling inside of me
The only thing I've ever known
If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home
If only New York wasn't so far away
I will be there every step of the way
And when you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home
Just know that I'm already home

We passed the stores, we passed the hotels
Filled our car with gasoline
We drove that night, I saw the moon
Almost got us in an accident
And then at the rest stop
When that woman tried to steal my wallet
It felt like an adventure
Isn't that what you would call it?
Isn't that what you would call it?
You're my road buddy, but I'm lonely all the time
I thought we'd be joking, having long talks on late night drives
But you drive so bad I lost my patience
So pass the chips and turn the station
This is not a romance with the road
Where the moss grows up the trees
To where the bird is rusty
I thought we'd find each story like a snakeskin or an arrowhead
But we only stop at fast food places
They hate their jobs, I understand
They try to act familiar, but they're floating just above the land
And we are all floating
You're my road buddy, but I'm lonely all the time
I thought we'd show that friendship could be stronger than the crossroads double back
I thought I heard the Tori sing, I'll take that thing I
This is not a romance with the road
In those cliffs are the same as in the magazines I have at home
And the tall grass reminds me of the same dreams I had at home
I thought life was a road and I wanted to begin it
I said, my friend and I going on a trip so I could only stop a minute
We go to the venting machines
I want to watch these kids with their mother
Sipping on their juice boxes and smiling at each other
And maybe that's their Dad on the phone
Saying, hey Mom, you couldn't wait, go ahead, have dinner
'Cause we're running just a little late
But we're on our way
Road buddy, road buddy, I heard about the boxcars and the family of travelers
But there's real estate sides in the cornfields
I know there's love, I bet there's trouble
But you just can't spend a lifetime on the road
And there's something I finally faced
I finally think I come from some place
This is not a romance with the road

Halos around her eyes and a dynamite walk
Run run you cant catch me up
Exploding like a sunrise that'l burn all you got
Run run you cant catch me up
She knows she's breaking necks in her jackie 'o' shades
Run run you cant catch me up
Turning heads knock em dead she'll destroy you
Open mouths in her wake she'll destroy you
Turning heads knock em dead she'll destroy you
She sets her eyes on you and she'll destroy you
She echoes round the room with her dynamite walk
Run run you cant catch me up
Pulling you in close enough to play with you heart
Run run you cant catch me up
If this love is a gun she's calling all of the shots
Run run you cant catch me up
Turning heads knock em dead she'll destroy you
Open mouths in her wake she'll destroy you
Turning heads knock em dead she'll destroy you
She sets her eyes on you and she'll destroy you
She's gonna blow you away, shes gonna blow you away
Turning heads knock em dead she'll destroy you
Open mouths in her wake she'll destroy you
Turning heads knock em dead she'll destroy you
She sets her eyes on you and she'll destroy you

Where'd you go, the red lagoon?
Are you gonna be coming back soon?
See, I stole your pack of goons
And put them in this tune
Never been to Minnesota
Still I'd love to live in Maine
Never been to Salamanca
Still I'd love to live in Spain
Where'd you go, the blue buffoon?
Your knuckles are out of tune
Your window doesn't face the moon
Are you happy with what you proved?
I've never been to Minnesota
Still I'd love to live in Maine
Never been to South Carolina
Still I'd love to live in Spain

There is a map of the world
That lies upon my weary face
Each line representing a mile
I have traveled from place to place
The colours are fading
The edges are tattered
It's grown a little worn with age
There is a map of the world
That lies upon my weary face
That I cannot erase
I cannot erase
Ooh-ooh
I cannot erase
The current of life pulled me under
And I was swept away
Expanding the distance between us
Every second to every day
I thought I had given
All I could offer
While trying to keep the dogs at bay
But the current of life pulled me under
And I was swept away
Beneath the tidal wave
Beneath the tidal wave
Ooh-ooh
Beneath the tidal wave
Beneath the tidal wave
I will be erased

here's a little something for all the
keen teen kings and queens:
learn a lesson from everything
cause noon will soon be nice and find
the color of your eyes as fine as
a phone call in fall
will this really matter much at all?
i'm learning and yearning and
swearing and swirling
the swerves make plans for the nerves
i'm hugging the curves
if the hips hold regret
i'll kiss you on the lips when we get where
where
the extra bedroom
you said it's good for the soul
so let's unbutton the bed undo the door and
loosen the lights and fall about the floor
so what i said was wrong
but what i meant was so right on
what i want to know is will you go where i go?
and you know how i sound so
here's my heart in arrows
sleep hard in the car and
i'll dare the loctor to
hover like a helicopter
our baby will be a raven
we'll name her eleanora fagan
caught up on the cross streets
stop and sing the telephone is busted
ring, ring i can't be trusted
up too late, too much kissing face
so what i said was wrong
but what i meant was so right on
what i want to know is will you go where i go
and you know how i sound so
here's my heart in arrows

I've been told
Ties
One child away
For Rome to spare
I can wait child
And write songs
By
Long beheaded
I am grateful
For
Roaming
And so I long for your econ
Either side
Era I
Rest tonight
Oh ho ho
Now
Autumn falls down
And I can hear the sound
Autumn falls down
Autumn goes down
And I till the ground
All I can ?

Where you running to now, baby
Running all the time
Where you running to now, darlin'
Running to all the time
Well, I sure hope it's to your sister
And not that mean brother of mine
I've been trying to reach you, darlin'
I try, I try in vain
I've been trying to reach you, darlin'
Though I try, I try in vain
I always end up losing you
And walking home in the rain
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Little band of gold
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Little band of gold
Will you be strong enough to keep her
Keep her love from going cold
There's a wildcat in you, woman
A wildcat on the prowl
There's a wildcat in you, woman
A wildcat on the prowl
Every time I put my arms around you
I can hear that wildcat growl
I remember when I met you
There was something about the moon
I remember the night I met you
There was something about the moon
I don't know if it was waxing or waning
But I knew that you'd be leaving soon
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Little band of gold
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Little band of gold
Will you be strong enough to keep her
To keep her love from getting old
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Little band of gold
Wedding ring, wedding ring
Little band of gold
Will you be strong enough to keep her
To keep her love from going cold
Will you be strong enough to keep her
To keep her love from getting old
Will you be strong enough to keep her
To keep her love from going cold

(with Josephine Foster)
Little life, how did you be so lucky
Little life, how did you be so glad
Songs arrive even in the mail box
Songs keep coming even happy to be sad
If you were a bird how would you fly
If you were a butterfly
If you were a penguin under the sea
If you were a bumble bee
Little life, how did you be so lucky
Little life, how did you be so glad
Songs arrive even in the mail box
Songs keep coming even happy to be sad
If you were a bird how would you fly
If you were a butterfly
If you were a penguin under the sea
If you were a person just like me
Oh Little life, how did you be so lucky
Oh Little life, how did you be so glad
Songs arrive even in the mail box
Songs keep coming even happy to be sad

I gave me away, I could have knocked off the evening
But I lonelily landed my waltz in her hands
In a way, I felt you were leaving me
I was sure I wouldn't find you at home
And you let me down, you could have knocked off the evening
But you lonelily let him push under your bone
You let me down, it's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone
And you're coming home
You're coming home
And you're coming home
You're coming home
I gave me away, I could have knocked off the evening
But I was lonelily looking for someone to hold
In a way, I lost all I believed in
And I never found myself so low
And you let me down, you could've called if you'd needed
But you lonelily got yourself locked in instead
And you let me down, it's one thing being cheated
But you took him all the way through your bed
And now you're coming home
And I'm trying to forgive, you're coming home
And I'm trying to forget, you're coming home
And I'm trying to move on, you're coming home
And you haven't called yet, you're coming home
And I'm trying to forgive, you're coming home
I'm just trying to forget, you're coming home
I'm trying to move on, you're coming home
But you haven't called, you're coming home
You're coming home, you're coming home
You're coming home
I gave me away, I could have knocked off the evening
But I lonelily loomed her into my bone
You let me down, there's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone

lonely at the only
clawing through the smoke
where the poets are so hip
they don't even write poems
and its lonely at the only 4 nights out of three
its not that i've been crying just that my eyes leak
if i knew what was wrong i'd let you know
buy me a drink; its no good to drink alone
there will be a getaway plan
from the boys with the paw hands
my beer smile meets your rye cheer
and who here's having the harder year?
(no one i guess)
Do you remember when the water came?
do you remember when the flood
filled the basements up with water
covered windows up in mud
do you remember when the water came?
do you remember when the flood
filled the cellars up with water covered windows up in mud
and its lonely at the only 4 nights out of three
its not that i've been crying just that my eyes leak
lonely at the only
clawing through the smoke
it's so hard to even know
if i knew what was wrong i'd let you know
buy me a drink; its no good to drink alone

saskatchewan winter night
and the bar's jammed clear
they're thinking of the summer slump
sun drought rain fear
saskatchewan
tractors frozen to the ground
on account of all the snow
the men sit at the bar and drink
to hockey night in toronto
the mother holds her baby closer against her chest
she's waiting for you to come home with this week's cheque
last week you drank it all
the week before that too
the week before that one
you lost it on the balls and cues...
saskatchewan...
and everybody drinks
because there's no work
because there's no rain
summer time is holding;
flies called back to work again
we all know you're leaving
we all know you've left
greyhound scars that build themselves
tighten in the chest
saskatchewan

Who will lead us when our faith is all but gone
who will be the light when daylight doesnt come
Who will be the ones to sacrifice their souls
who will be the men to live just for love
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I can see now how the child can grow old
and I can see just how the darkness takes it's hold
and I have seen how the compromise is made
and I can see how a light can loose his way
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
Who will lead us when our faith is all but gone
who will be the light when daylight doesnt come
Who will be the ones to sacrifice their souls
who will be the men to live just for love
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow
Rainbow

What am I gonna do about you girl?
You don't seem to believe me when I say
That you are the one that's got me feeling this way
You've got me groovin', yeah
You've got me groovin' groovin' groovin'
But please don't believe that we ain't got it real
I should know just how I feel
Please believe me when I say
You are the one that's got me feeling this way
Yeah, you are the one that's got me feeling this way
And it ain't no stupid memory of mine
Please forgive me if I've been out of line
It's you girl, you've got me groovin
You've got me groovin', yeah
You've got me groovin' groovin' groovin'

I just want to join the party,
but the confetti falling is razor sharpened.
I just want to blow out the candles,
but the cake is sprinkled with punctured skulls.
I just want to celebrate,
but the stripper they hired lost both her legs.
I just want to join the party,
but the pinata's stuffed with oil and sand.
I just want the flag to be my baby,
but her kissing breath is so revolting.
Tastes like hospitals, machine guns, burning hair, McDonalds buns.
I peel the wrapping paper back,
and I'm staring at an amputee.
When they fish a corpse out of the pool
the applause light goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
And every soldier's spewing black cum from their victory hard on.
I want to celebrate!
And the clown in the fight suit is cracking jokes to the camera crew.
I want to celebrate!
The children smile and clap their hands
when they pull another baby from the rubble.
While their parents scamper for a partner to dance the freedom shuffle.
I just want to join the party,
but the song on the karaoke says,
"If you want to celebrate compassion is crulety and hip, hip, hooray!"
And every soldier's spewing black cum from their victory hard on.
I want to celebrate!
And the clown in the fight suit is cracking jokes to the camera crew.
I want to celebrate!
Wolf-faced gladiators always ruin a party.
They lick your punch, bomb out your windows, feel up your wife,
chew up your clothes.
And every soldier's spewing black cum from their victory hard on.
I want to celebrate!
And the clown in the fight suit is cracking jokes to the camera crew.
I want to celebrate!

Set a fire set my heart
hit me like alarm
when they love their slow love
it hits me so hard
I fell upon a rocket
high on its side
we had already cried
enough, enough
listen angel to the still
slow words we say
my birds flies
she blinds my eyes
but i can't look away
I fell upon a rocket
high on its side
we had already cried
enough, now it's time to get up

I apologize,
Seem to have arrived,
On what items in my bag from your house.
There's cutlery,
A tablecloth, some Hennessy,
And a book on Presidents deceased.
I'll have them fed-exed to you,
It was a strange thing to do,
I hope we can still be friends.
Ah, it was not me,
But someone else, you see,
Twisting the steering reins.
Put a penny in the slot and make an
Artificial li-ii-iight shine,
Leave go-ooo. Mark old and line.
I don't give advise,
But be wise and think twice,
Before getting involved in a game.
Where the minority
Face the majority,
Who are faceless and born without names.
Was it knock synch when
We came across three men,
They had church candles wrapped in newspaper.
I bought two from them,
And I'll lit one for you,
I hope the message made it's way down the wire.
Put a penny in the slot and make an
Artificial li-ii-iight shine,
Leave go-ooo. Mark old and line.
The soul of a dog,
He's alive and not gone
To the farm like the others said.
A Rhodesian richback,
Off the beaten track,
In a furniture shop down on the quays.
For the loneliness you foster,
I suggest Paul Auster,
A book called Timbuktu.
Put a penny in the slot and watch the
Drunken sailor boy dance.
She will not let you be
Her lov-ver.
She goes out looking for
The taxi.
Her phone is ringing straight to
Message-minder.
Send out a battalion to
Find her.
Put a penny in the slot and count the
Swans through a te-elescope.
I can't help from cryin'
I wish you were mine.
When I was seventeen,
I followed my dream,
Up into a high-rise block.
The adventures of Augie March,
By Saul Bel-low,
Was all I had for company.
At night time I'd lie
In Beckingham pike,
With tears like flashbulbs.
And recall my treasure-
Searching days,
In the rock pools as a kid.
To the remains of
The cherub plains,
Or around the bonfire in Nailors? cove.
Good company and grief
Sit like a doc leaf,
Sits beside a singing nett-le.
Put a penny in the slot and make an
Artificial li-ii-iight shi-iine,
Leave go-ooo. My golden arm

Water may walk
Daughter may walk
Mother may walk
Father may walk
Moth fell asleep in a perfect fire
Water in hands
Mother in hands
Brother in hands
Held in the hands
Of one million bending bones
I know it's name
You know it's name
Never above
Never above
One thousand mending moans
A fire inside
A silver inside
The hollow inside
The echo inside
The red setting sun inside
The earth has it's eyes
The sea has eyes too
Brown mother eyes
Blue mother blue
And eyes are the stems of space
Mother may grow
Daughter may grow
Father may grow
And swallow the seed
Of trees in the chest of my mind
I've got some to give
I'd like to give some
Love will still live
When our time is done
Death be light, be light

She is a little explosion of hope
Never turns the lights down low
She can go there if you want to though
There are no markings on her country roads
No signs that show the way back home
But when you get there, you won't wanna go
I've frozen over my desires
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her
She burns, yeah, she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I'm melting darling and I can't let go
She likes to lay under the covers, oh
Pretend that everywhere's our home
Keeps me warm right to my very soul
We get so tangled up, it's hard to know
What is hers and what my own
Vines at the bottom of an olive grove
I've frozen over my desires
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her
She burns, yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I'm melting darling and I can't let go
I'm melting darling and I can't let go
I'm melting darling and I can't let go

Saturday night never gets better
I'm home alone missing out on you
Hurts like moonlight chasing me away
Dancing outside, nobody's missing
These nights don't feel like they're ever gonna end
Someone come
Don't go, don't go
Make things better
My messy life won't let me start over
Maybe it's alright, maybe I'm fine
This wait will pass, it can't flood
She knows, she knows I'm no good at waiting
Dreamin', dreamin' won't make you feel closer
Someday, someday will never be over
These nights don't seem like they're ever gonna end
Someone come
I feel it going down again
Won't let up
Will it be like this all my life?
One last try

Down here underneath the microscope,
it's hard to cope.
don't hide your face in your hands,
'cause if your eyes play tricks,
it's outta my control.
it's gonna be a long cold winter.
the skeletons of trees, my blackwater child
if you don't love me, well, don't shove me
out into the dark
without a flashlight or a spark.
any stitches cling like bitches to my arms
for all my charms.
it's gonna be a crooked little winter
the skeletons of trees, my blackwater child
she's walking home
to the devil's flowers.
the broken bones
of heavy hours.
we stayed out late,
it's a lighthouse trait.
and we'll take our time

The city called me so I came
It isn't mine to question what it said
I sleep until the point when I'm awake
I walk until there's nothing left to trek
And everyone is looking for an answer
And everyone is waiting for a break
I came and I was bored of it soon after
But I had nowhere to go and so I stayed
I dreamed a lifetime of this place
It seemed an awful thing to waste
Well the morning fills my mouth up with decay
I like it, it reminds me how you taste
Sometimes I feel you rising up behind me like the wind
But I still try to look away
What will you look like when you're old?
(What will you look like when you're old?)
What will I do if I don't know you?
(What will I do if I don't know you?)
I guess that I decided not to ask the day I took the road
Down to the city as it called
Sun making silhouettes of gauze
I don't remember you at all
The city called me and I came
It isn't mine to question why
Sometimes the clouds will rise ahead, I hear your name
It's like a choir in the sky
What will you look like when you're old?
(What will you look like when you're old?)
What will I do if I don't know you?
(What will I do if I don't know you?)
I guess that I decided not to know the day I took the road
Down to the city as it called
Sun making silhouettes of gauze
I don't remember you at all
They pulled a human from my waist
It had your mouth, it had your face
I would have kept it if I'd stayed.

somehow there must be some money in this business
somehow I have my doubts about this
if there is no money there must be meaning
that must mean were doing something right
my dad is a good guy, his dad was an asshole
won't someone tell me why everything's a hassle
why don't I make better money, why can't I make more people smile
why don't you ever come around I haven't seen you in a while
somehow there must be some money in this business
somehow I have my doubts about this
if there is no money there is no meaning
that must mean we're doing something wrong
I'm sorry I'm such a letdown
I'm sorry I never came through
I'm sorry I put so much time in
I'm sorry I was never there for you

Deep inside my heart and its splintered at its core
Molden curdle of milken ^ puddle
Dreams of warm breasts settling in my mouth
To be my spouse, make a babe and a house
Apple tree, drunken brawl domestically
A Dirty dog, a dusty pawed bloody nose, rose embroidered sheets
Dangle like women in the breeze, on a line above the yard
In my heart a flower dies slow like a campfire covered
In piss mellows like snow fall
Mellows like snow fall
Raphael you know just how
To take me in the swimming pool
Like a child being baptized
Beneath the starry sky we lie
Drowning in your watery thighs
Luscious eyes
You a teenage player
In my heart an island sinks slow
Tears fall in the kitchen sink O
Don't speak I can hear you
Don't speak I can hear you

I love my father and I love him well
I hope to see him someday soon
I love my father and I love him well
I hope to see him someday soon
'Cause where I live, it gets dark at night
The kind of dark eats up the light
Yeah where I live, it gets dark at night
The kind of dark eats up the light
And you know that, mother, I'd be lying
If I didn't tell you I'm afraid of night
And as I dream I'm falling down
The world moves without a sound
I'm lost as sure as I was found
The sun comes up without a sound
So I up and face another day
And I hope that kindness comes your way
Yeah I'll up and face another day
And I hope that kindness comes your way
This for you I pray
I pray for you today
And in the morning I'll be gone
Wherefore and to cannot be told
Yes in the morning I'll be gone
Wherefore and to cannot be told
A mind filled with memories
Weigh me down like gold
I love my father and I love him well
I hope to see him someday soon
I love my father and I love him well
I hope to see him someday soon

CHINESE CHILDREN
If I lived in China,
I'd have some Chinese children
If I lived in China,
I'd have some Chinese children
Well
LITTLE BOYS
Life is tough
And love is rough
For the men who just can't seem to ever get enough
The days go by
And the women come and go
So many that you decide to give in and (?)
So you don't have to hear
Them all disappear
You just sit and you wait
Staring at your empty plate
And you can say, I'm a lonely sailor
Rocking gently on my dream
'Cause I can have it all
But I don't want it all
And live like I never, ever, ever tried
I just never been fully satisfied
Just to tie a little shoelace
And to share a sleeping bag
And I look ahead to the day
When I look back at all the fun that I've had
But still, but still, but still
I see so many
Little boys I want to marry
I see plenty
Little kids I'll get to have
Even when the moon goes out
Even when the sea dries out
I still see so many
Little boys I want to marry
I'll see plenty
Little kids I'll get to have now
Even when the seas all freeze
And everything is lying underneath
And even when the sun ceases to shine
I won't care,
I'll still have all my mind
So many
Little boys I want to marry
I'll see plenty
Little kids I'll get to have now
Well, little child,
When I get my dreaming done
I'll hold my breath
And I'll wait for the day to come
Oh, little Billy,
Little Timmy,
Little Jimmy,
You're the one
I may not look it,
But I swear my heart is young
For so many
Little boys I want to marry
I see plenty
Little kids I'll get to have
I got many
Little boys I want to marry
I got plenty
Little kids I'll get to have

Walls gone over the sea
But not for me
Watch now, all will end
Now all that I'm, under a tide
Now I'm, under a tide
Tall hair under it all
Much more than I once had
Over seas

If I was young, I'd flee this town
I'd bury my dreams underground
As did I, we drink to die, we drink tonight
Far from home, elephant gun
Let's take them down one by one
We'll lay it down, it's not been found, it's not around
Let the seasons begin
Let the seasons begin, take the big king down
Let the seasons begin
Let the seasons begin, take the big king down
And it rips through the silence of our camp at night
And it rips through the night
And it rips through the silence of our camp at night
And it rips through the silence, all that is left is

No conditions
No exceptions
No time to pause and check your reflection
Don't know if you'll find a way without a compass or chart
No additions
No retractions
No way to appease all the warring factions
No sword to fall upon
Nothing will not fall apart
No, nothing has ever seemed clear
And I know it hasn't been our best year
Maybe I wasn't listening, but I never did hear any call
No, we never had minds to forget
We haven't hit bottom just yet
But then maybe
There isn't a bottom at all
No one is guiding you now, telling you where to go
The sky and the plow has erased all your tracks in the snow
Nothing and nowhere and no one is not a pretender
But remember
No surrender
No breaking the news
No changing the weather
No use trying to keep it together
No one is telling you you shouldn't feel lonely tonight
No answer for the doctor
Not not the one that you were after
Every test could be wrong, then again
Every test could be right
No way to be certain
There is no one behind the curtain
And clicking your heels, no matter how good it feels
It won't bring you back home
No one is guiding you now, telling you where to go
The sky and the plow has erased all your tracks in the snow
Nothing and nowhere and no one is not a pretender
But remember
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender

Mama got to worrying
'Cause her boy left home home in a hurry again
Her photograph was fading
She keeps a box in a closet for the maid
That is where
I left the note on the floor in my room
I always been stubborn and late to bloom
I had to lay down my love
My burdens are my own
It's a coming of age, when you feel it you know
When you feel it you know, yes
When you feel it you know
And I know, I know
I was longing on a short summer night
When I had the urge to leave
I went out to find my muse
Beneath in my pocket and I'm craving for some
Hey Jim Blues, what you said
I was following my fall leaves
When I saw her aboard the River Queen
I was courting my Creole lady
All the way to New Orleans
But I was soon, my woman is true
So I climbed the roof and gave that woman my crew
I had to her all I know
My business is my own
It's a coming of age, when you feel it you know
When you feel it you know
When you feel it you know
And I know, I know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it
Well, mama got to worrying
She says now boy I stay up late wondering where you been
Oh, soon you're gonna have to give in
No, you can't live forever the way that you been, oh
Mama, I'm not trying to do no wrong
I had to learn this is the way I get along
It's the life that I chose
My reasons are my own
It's a coming of age, when you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
When you feel it you know
When you feel it
I know, I know
When you feel it you know
When you feel it you know, yes
When you feel it you know

In my mind I'm crawling on your floor
Vomiting and defeated
Total absence of grace
Your reluctant voice saying
You decide your own fate but
I wear rubber bands round my soul
They keep me from crawling
And these rubber bands round my soul
They keep me from falling
In my repeated dreams
You stare at me with an empty gaze
You turn your back on me
And you search for more intriguing days
Loathing this
Controlling this
Let me get a hold of this so
I wear rubber bands round my soul
They keep me from crawling
And these rubber bands round my soul
They keep me from falling

V1.
Spend your dollars
Spend your pounds
We sleep it off and make our rounds
I followed you around the world
Through every city, every town
But how much longer?
Ch.
See there's aiming the gun
And there's pulling the trigger
You can say what you want
But you know that there's a difference
V2.
We meet with smiles
Part with cries
We board a plane and dry our eyes
The hands create a disconnect
It breaks through bonds and takes our eyes
And the obligation is not yours
When winter ends and we head north
You've kept the breath inside our lungs
And we stood up on your supports
But now no longer
Ch. 2
See there's aiming the gun
And there's pulling the trigger
You can say what you want
But you know that there's a difference
And you are not your mom
And I am not my father
But if we don't have the time
I suppose that it's no bother
No, it's no bother.

A poetic genius genius,
Its something I don't see,
Why would a genius be trippin on me?
And there's looking and another ,
Why he can't see is that I'm looking through his eyes,
So many lies behind his eyes.
N tell me stories from your past,
And sing me songs you wrote before.
I tell you this my Poison Prince,
You'll soon be knocking on Heaven's door.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
With your eyes in a daze.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
Your life is like a maze.
And what we all want and what we all crave,
Is an upbeat song,
So we can dance the night away.
Who said life was easy,
Who said life was fair,
Who said nobody gived a damn,
And nobody even cared.
The way you're acting now,
Like you left that all behind.
You've given up,
You've given in,
And I'm a sucker of that kind.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
With your eyes in a daze.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
Your life is like a maze.
And what we all want and what we all crave,
Is an upbeat song ,
So we can dance the night away.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
With your eyes in a daze.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
Your life is like a maze.
And what we all want and what we all crave,
Is an upbeat song ,
So we can dance the night away.

Once I could see.
Now I am found out, I've been set free.
Nothing ever seems to bother me.
And time is passing by but leaves no thrill.
Under the moon.
You see how they smile.
Hope that you'll never be like them.
Kaleidoscope turn in be your friend.
This time just wasn't made for you and me.
Under, under the moon.
Aaaaaa.
I'm afraid of losing you.
Am I? Am I?
Your a part of something new.
Am I? Am I?
Am I really losing you?
Am I? Am I?
Being part of something new.
Am I? Am I?

Time takes care of the wound, so I can believe
You had so much to give, you thought I couldn't seek
Gifts for boot, heels to crush, promises deceived
I had to send it away to bring us back again
Your eyes and body brighten silent waters deep
Your precious daughter in the other room asleep
A kiss goodnight from every stranger that I meet
I had to send it away to bring us back again
Morning theft and pretender left ungrateful
True self is what brought you here to me
A place where we can accept this love
Friendship battered down by useless history
Unexamined failure
What am I still to you? Some thief who stole from you?
Or some fool drama queen whose chances were few?
That brings us to who we need, a place where we can save
A heart that beats as both siphon and reservoir
You're a woman, I'm a calf, you're a window, I'm a knife
We come together making chance in the starlight
Meet me tomorrow night or any day you want
I have no right to wonder just how or when
And though the meaning fits, there's no relief in this
I miss my beautiful friend
I had to send it away to bring her back again

I won't forget when Peter Pan came to my house, took my hand
I said I was a boy; I'm glad he didn't check.
I learned to fly, I learned to fight
I lived a whole life in one night
We saved each other's lives out on the pirate's deck.
And I remember that night
When I'm leaving a late night with some friends
And I hear somebody tell me it's not safe, someone should help me
I need to find a nice man to walk me home.
When I was a boy, I scared the pants off of my mom,
Climbed what I could climb upon
And I don't know how I survived,
I guess I knew the tricks that all boys knew.
And you can walk me home, but I was a boy, too.
I was a kid that you would like, just a small boy on her bike
Riding topless, yeah, I never cared who saw.
My neighbor come outside to say, "Get your shirt,"
I said "No way, it's the last time I'm not breaking any law."
And now I'm in a clothing store, and the sign says less is more
More that's tight means more to see, more for them, not more for me
That can't help me climb a tree in ten seconds flat
When I was a boy, see that picture? That was me
Grass-stained shirt and dusty knees
And I know things have gotta change,
They got pills to sell, they've got implants to put in, they've got implants to remove
But I am not forgetting
That I was a boy too
And like the woods where I would creep, it's a secret I can keep
Except when I'm tired, except when I'm being caught off guard
I've had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way
To catching fire-flies out in the backyard.
And I tell the man I'm with about the other life I lived
And I say now you're top gun, I have lost and you have won
And he says, "Oh no, no, can't you see
When I was a girl, my mom and I we always talked
And I picked flowers everywhere that I walked.
And I could always cry, now even when I'm alone I seldom do
And I have lost some kindness
But I was a girl too.
And you were just like me, and I was just like you.

It was just before the moon hung
Her weary heavy head in the gallows and the graves of the milky milky cradle
His tears have turned to poppies
A shimmer in the midnight
A flower in the twilight
A flower in the twilight
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow
They took him to the gallows
He fought them all the way though
And when they asked us how we knew his name
We died just before him
Our eyes are in the flowers
Our hands are in the branches
Our voices in the breezes
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow tree
We're waiting by the willow
Our milky milky cradle
Our lockets long have rusted
His picture worn and weathered
Our hair is in the garden
The roses in our toeses
Our heart are in the blossoms
Our eyes are in the branches
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow tree

This voice
Is it calling
Is it calling
It's your choice
She said
Take or let go
Is it calling
When you're all alone
In your own sweet home
Is it calling
This voice
Is it calling
I have to say
I choose get out of my way
Leave my ghost alone
Let me walk on by
Let me walk on by
Let me walk on by
Let me walk on by
This voice
It is calling
It is calling for me
If you still haven't heard it
You shouldn't ask for it
You should just leave it be
'Cause you're deaf until
The day for you it will
Be calling
This voice
It is calling

From the ship, we could see it in the distance
As the fog was finally lifting
We had come to the shores of Summerday
Gently landing, we jumped out on the sand and found our way
Where the dirt was soft and black
We started digging a garden
And soon we found the woods that we'd call
The forest of Arden for to play
When we came to Summerday
On the shores of Summerday
We will live in Summerday
And we climbed a stony mountain
We were boisterous then quiet
As we thought about what instruments to make
Soon we started to build the uillean pipes and fine guitars
Then we scouted out the hollows for solitude and silence
And we found the places we could meet by the blue and glassy river
Under stars where the paper lanterns sway
In the streets of Summerday
Trust the night and trust the day
Sun and moon of Summerday
We are pilgrims in the land between religions
We are following our children
And we paint in different colors every day
And if we're true to our hearts they will grow up and want to stay
We will work beside them as they build modest houses
And on a misty April morning we'll rest the shovels on the fence
And die and become a summer day
Oh, the fields of Summerday
And the flowers of Summerday
They will live in Summerday
To the shores of Summerday
So we sail to Summerday
We will live in Summerday

I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads
From falling in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And Michael, you would fall
And turn the white snow red as strawberries
In the summertime
I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads
From falling in the snow

Isaac are you listening
I watched it from afar
I watched as the clouds began to part
Issac can you see my now
I've known you all my life
And I worship the ground you walk upon
Isaac will you never learn
That a father's love must be earned
Or your mother need not learn
Isaac I have never seen you look so afraid
With your head pressed so hard against the stone
You look so alone
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
Isaac are you listening
I watched it from afar
As your your life fell apart
Isaac will you never learn
That a father's love must be earned
Or your mother need not learn
How to love you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you
I'm going to give all my love to you

In the dark we are without her empress light
In the dark we are without a light
Half asleep we're calmly waiting through her night
Half asleep we wait 'til she arrives
Clouds of birds are covering her dark blue sky
Clouds of birds are covering her sky
A rush of wind is gently playing with their wings
And yellow stones are standing on her eyes
All rejoices are, we're when in her hands
It's all rejoice we are in her hands
Owl eyes, her sun will rise and light the land
All rejoice we are in her hands

I awoke, only to find my lungs empty
And through the night, so it seems I'm not breathing
And now my dreams, are nothing like they were meant to be
And I'm breaking down, I think I'm breaking down
And I'm afraid, to sleep because of what haunts me
Such as, living with the uncertainty
That'll never find the words to say
Which would completely explain, just how I'm breaking down
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead but now it's like the night is taking sides
And all the worries that occupy the back of my mind
Could it be, this misery will suffice
I've become, a simple souvenir of someone's kill
Like the sea, I'm constantly changing from calm to ill
Madness fills my heart and soul as if the
Great divide could swallow me whole, oh how I'm breaking down
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead but now it's like the night is taking sides
And all the worries that occupy the back of my mind
Could it be, this misery will suffice
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Could it be, this misery will suffice

We came so by to the sea silently,
So when we go to the sea soundlessly.

I'll shed my silence on the sea silently,
And when we go shed your waves soundlessly.
Say ma no fy byaba see na go, say ma no by byaba da say na low.

Once upon a time there was a nuclear family,
And we lived in a family time,
And we'd unite in a family way.
And off in the ancient mountain,
They were splitting every nucleus.
They said, "Don't be alarmed,
Just don't try this at home."
And they were the mystery that made the world run
And we had the power, 'cause they were the sun
And we called them our heroes, and the future had come.
They said, "Look at the light we're giving you,
And the darkness we're saving you from."
Soon they were bringing it into our showroom,
And they'd unveil it with it's title,
Bring your family, bring your family,
It's the great unknown.
You can look, but you can't fathom,
It's the Great Unknown.
I'm no ordinary princess,
I was born in the Cold War,
And my team is the Rockets,
Go team, it's a dangerous time
And I dream of the moon and building lunar clone colonies.
And I build my peace with strength,
That's the best weapon you've got.
Oh, I am the brainchild, I am the mortar,
With a plastic trophy and an eating disorder,
And vision as big as a great big wall,
And they tell me that I'll move forward
For the good of us all,
And the good of nuclear families all.
And they think I think I am important.
I know I never was, no, I wasn't.
No, I never, and how could I be?
It's the great unknown.
Now we've built it, now it's ticking,
It's the great unknown.
And I am your children, I am millions
And I wanted to sell out, I wanted to try,
But the sky got too low
And the ocean got too high.
And I tried to take God into my own hands
Am I too late? Is it over?
Have I sacrificed my family to the great unknown?
There's a war between my conscience and the great unknown.
So I walked out into the gamma fields
Out in Mercury, Nevada.
Where I stood in circle,
And that circle started to pray.
And the wind at the nuclear test sites
Floats the data of the radiation.
From the underground testing,
Cross the line, you'll get arrested.
And we came from all over in a silent appeal
As the drill comes down like a presidential seal.
And we stand for the living, and we stand for the dead,
And we looked out to see your enemies,
And we see that you're looking all at us instead.
And you think I am being disruptive?
But no, I'm running home, I'm running,
'Cause I'm trying to put the atom back together.
It's the great unknown.
I'm just trying to put the atom back together.
It's the great unknown.

Oh
There's a lot of love, but not the kind I need
Haveya ever made soup-out-of pumpkin seeds
There's a lot of skin and flesh I never should have seen
There's too many half-ways-in-betweens. there's a lot of stays, I think I wish I'd done
There's a lot of leaves my true love gave to me
There's a lot of birds that people like to draw
There's a lot of sees, I wish I never saw.

There's a dream I have,
It comes back when all the days turn into one.
I'm in a coat and hat,
And I'm standing on the coast of England.
With a castle and cathedral on the sand,
I reached down to touch the water with my hand.
Then you turn and say to me,
"You've been talking in your sleep,
What did you see? What does it mean?"
I was a photograph
Of our day trip from the window of a train.
The one we cut in half.
I kept mine and made a bookmark on a page.
It fell out today as I was getting packed.
Have I left you here more times than I've come back?
Like that snowfall out of reach,
We kept our details underneath,
Once made of stone, we went for broke.
I didn't know.
Are you a dreamer?

I'll take the plans this time
And I'll change them all, da-da-da-da-da
I'll take the plans this time
And I'll take control
It's alright now
Alright now
Strength alone in the steel and the backbone
Strength alone's by and by
All alone in the steel and the stone, it's
All alone by and by
I'll take the plans this time
And I'll change them all, da-da-da-da-da
I'll take the plans this time
And I'll take control
It's alright now
Alright now
Strength alone in the steel and the backbone
Strength alone's by and by
All alone in the steel and the stone, it's
All alone by and by

It's like you're standing on my chest
Looking down, looking down
With your eyes at me, at me
I am drowning in those eyes
I am drowning in those eyes
I am drowning in those eyes
I can't breathe
Oh, you are
I can't breathe
With you on top of me
It's like you're standing on my chest
Looking down
Looking down

You're like a demon on my back
You cage me
You bring me down
You plague me
I bet you swore I'd take you back
You're crazy
You bring me down
You caged me
Once upon a time I thought you were irresistible
You were mystical and magical to me
Now I don't quite you are so radical
So I'm leaving you to be free
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home
Like I was something you owned
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home
You called it freedom
Your love is what my nightmares are made of
You laid your cards on the table
Took mine away
You said I wasn't able to give you love
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home
You called it freedom
You called it love
Your obsession with control
Pains me
It wore me down
It changed me
And I thought that getting out would kill me
But it's been such a bitter relief
A bitter sweet release
You can't be my medicine
Come on
Check out the evidence
I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
You mistake your arrogance for intelligence
So I'm leaving you to be free
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home like I was something you owned
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home
You called it freedom
Your love is what my nightmares are made of
You laid your cards on the table
Took mine away
You said I wasn't able to give you love
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home
You called it freedom
You called it love
You caged me in your home like I was something you owned
Well, what did you expect?
You caged me in your home
You called it freedom
You called it love

Pale light this morning
Woke me
Slow pain I feel
Will not let me be
So much work to do
I don't know if I can
Trying so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm just one man
Five years old I climbed up on the wall
My mother warned me but I took no heed
Like all creatures great and small
I took a fall and found out I could bleed
These days I'm afraid of everything
Suppose cause everything will die
Thought it was to love what they will lose
So much easier to lie
Sometimes I fell like I'm drowning
Actually it's more like most of the time
But every now and then when I'm sleeping
I still have a dream that I'm flying
And I wake up crying

God of the poor man this is how the day began
Eight co defendants, I, Daniel Berrigan
Oh and only a layman's batch of napalm
We pulled the draft files out
We burned them in the parking lot
Better the files than the bodies of children
I had no right but for the love of you
I had no right but for the love of you
Many roads led here, walked with the suffering
Tom in Guatemala, Phillip in New Orleans
Oh it's a long road from law to justice
I went to Vietnam, I went for peace
They dropped their bombs
Right where my government knew I would be
I had no right but for the love of you
I had no right but for the love of you
And all my country saw
Were priests who broke the law
First it was question, then it was a mission
How to be American, how to be a Christian
Oh if their law is their cross and the cross is burning
The love of you
The love of you
God of the just I'll never win a peace prize
Falling like Jesus
Now let the jury rise
Oh it's all of us versus all that paper
They took the only way they know who is on trial today
Deliver us unto each other, I pray
I had no right but for the love of you
And every trial I stood, I stood for you
Eyes on the trial
Eight a.m. arrival
Hands on the Bible

They say love is an island
Beautiful at a distance
Some are trying to find it
Some are trying to find a way out
You've been on both sides
Of these rough waters
Somehow you survived
But you came out on your own
And you still need someone
Will you set sail
Will you set sail tonight
Till we see land
Never look back or behind
I don't know if we'll get lost at sea
Or we'll end up where we're supposed to be
Are you brave enough to swim against the tide?
Love leaves you stranded
But that's the way we want it
Safe in our own refuge
No one else will ever reach it
Will you be that someone
Will you set sail
Will you set sail tonight
Till we see land
Never look back or behind
I don't know if we'll get lost at sea
Or we'll end up where we're supposed to be
Are you brave enough to swim against the tide?
Any breaking wave can lead you home
Or turn you upside down and leave you here
With no one here to hurt you
But no one there to save you
Will you risk it all?
Will you set sail
Will you set sail tonight
Till we see land
Never look back or behind
I don't know if we'll get lost at sea
Or we'll end up where we're supposed to be
Are you brave enough to swim against the tide?

I'd love to meet him
The original
Now be ready, I can't run and
I'd love to meet him
The original
Now must be ready, I can't run
Nothing's been said, but what you wrote
Nothing's been said, but what you taught me
Nothing's been said, but what you wrote
Nothing's been said
I'd love to meet him
The original
Make me ready I can't run and
I'd love to meet him
The original
Make me ready I can't run
Nothing's been said, but what you wrote
Nothing's been said, but what you taught me
Nothing's been said, but what you taught me
Nothing's been said and
I'd love to be sad
It makes me so sad
It makes me red
I can melt
I love the music
It makes me red
It makes me ready
I can melt
Nothing's been said, but what you wrote
Nothing's been said, but what you taught me
Nothing's been said, but you what you wrote
Nothing's been said since now

I used to say dumb things
I guess I still do
I'm doing it again
But that's what happens
When you're in view
More used to naked men
You said leave the light on
Don't be frightened
I don't know how long
I can wait to see if my
Apology's accepted
Too proud to hang my head
In shame beside your bed
But sometimes you want something
So bad, you'll grab anything
You said that's ridiculous
There's only one thing that precious
I don't know how long
I can wait to see if my
Apology's Accepted
I gotta know is my
Apology accepted
Time and time again
Your soft eyes close
In trust above me
Such a simple question
I pretended I was sleeping
I didn't know anything
But you I'm keeping
I don't know how long
I can wait to see if my
Apology's Accepted
I gotta know is my
Apology Accepted

Go ask for the gasoline, mama
Go ask for the gasoline, mama
say please, oh pretty please
may I have the Gasolina Mama
Oh but i let you win
you silhouette and wing
I could have caught the dawn
with the ear of blue corn
but I let you win
you indefinite thing
Now go ask for the gasoline, mama
Go ask for the gasoline, mama
say please, oh pretty please
may I have the Gasolina Mama
See, I up and staged my death
in the mosquito net
there by Grandma's house
I lay quiet as a spouse
the pink porpoise within
sang to the jungle him
"You are in no shape to drive"
And a maze you'll make out just fine
now the vine is tossed
you are no more lost
than is the wind
now let me in
then we'll ask for the gasoline, mama
we'll ask for the gasoline, mama
say please o pretty please
may I have the Gasolina Mama
Mama mama
mama mama
mama mama
mama

Little ghost, you're listening,
Unlike most you don't miss a thing,
You see the truth
I walk the halls invisibly,
I climb the walls, no one sees me,
No one but you.
You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wing's still beating,
You've always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty
Oh oh, no no no, oh
Oh little ghost, you see the pain
But together we can make something beautiful
So take my hand and perfectly,
We fill the gaps, you and me make three,
I was meant for you, and you for me
You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wing's still beating,
You've always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty.
Oh oh, no no no, oh
You've always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wing's still beating,
You've always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty

it would be wiser if I seemed a little lost
a little helpless like I needed someone
when the opposite is true
all I need is for you to let me do it by myself
to let me do it by myself
I'm someone you all lean on
I'm someone you all lean on
I'm someone you all lean on
la da da dum da da da dum
la da da dum da da da dum
she's a fawn lost in the woods
with a pretty dress and a quivering heart
everyone leans in to lend a hand
to catch her when she falls
and you know that she will
I'm someone you all lean on
I'm someone you all lean on
I'm someone you all lean on
la da da dum da da da dum
la da da dum da da da dum
would you catch me if I fall?
would you catch me if I fall?
would you catch me if I fall?
I know that you will . . .

Took a powder from a life
of a carrion type
mystery meats
in the dull before dawn, O
I was brought up
in the early night
said 'oh, well
alright' with eyes
on the mountains
since my work as
a young girl
But now way
way New Age
way way New Age
From the cradle with a bang
to the Garden State I came
when a voice sang to me
and this exactly what it said:
'Will you be the rose to the stone?
Will you come to drive the needles' own?
They'll say what they'll say
O and you'll translate it, O
The morning from night'
Way way out of the way
Way way out of the way
Yet, fully formed I sprang
the wind in my cell rang
I came all the way up the vein of interstate
To be the rose the stone
a bloom of new flesh on the bone
O, say what you'll say
O, honey I'll translate it, O
the morning from night
The jet into a powder form of light
taken at the head of a new life
once more you make it through the night
on the floor the sleepers open wide
a door to the feeder of the fire
sings me to life on the vine

Shh
So I guess that I'm the comedian
When I say "What's the deal
With all of these games we play?"
And I can't stop having these feelings
You've got me saying "Oh my God"
Cause you give and then you take away.
Every day,
You make me weak like a heartbeat.
But you go too slow
Take it slow like a heartbeat.
Take it slow
Take it slow like a heartbeat.
Take it slow
I lose control of my heartbeat.
Take it slow
Take it slow like a heartbeat.
So I guess that you're the comedian
Cause you keep killing me
What you do is killing me.
And I don't stop having these feelings
You've got me saying "Oh my God"
With all the shit you're feeding me.
Every day,
You make me weak like a heartbeat.
But you go too slow
Take it slow like a heartbeat.
Take it slow
Take it slow like a heartbeat.
Take it slow
I lose control of my heartbeat.
Take it slow
Take it slow like a heartbeat.

So let's face it this was never what you wanted
And I know its fun to pretend
Now blank stares and empty threats
Are all I have, they're all I have.
So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation.
And I fall, I fall, I faulter
But I found you, before I drift away
Now you still speak of day old hate
Though your whole world has gone up into flames
And isn't it great to find that you're really worth nothing
And how safe it is to feel safe.
So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation.
And I fall, I fall, I fall down
But I found you, before I drift away

Do I have nothing good left to say?
Do I need whiskey to start fueling my complaints?
People love to drink their troubles away
Sometimes I feel that I'd be better off that way
'Cause maybe then I could sleep at night
I wouldn't lie awake until the morning light
This is something that I'll never control
My nerves will be the death of me, I know
I know, I know
So here's to living life miserable
And here's to all the lonely stories that I've told
Maybe drinking wine will validate my sorrow
Every man needs a muse and mine could be the bottle
Maybe then I could sleep at night
I wouldn't lie awake until the morning light
This is something that I'll never control
My nerves will be the death of me, I know
Finally, I could hope for a better day
No longer holding on to all the things that cloud my mind
Maybe then the weight of the world wouldn't seem so heavy
But then again, I'll probably always feel this way
At least I know I'll never sleep at night
I'll always lie awake until the morning light
This is something that I'll never control
My nerves will be the death of me
My nerves will be the death of me
My nerves will be the death of me, I know

My tired eyes
are like
lonely stars
trying to find a little
order in the chaos
So I take a bus ride
in the afternoon
you all look so happy, and me,
I'm barely hanging on
This is what you do to me
Drag myself out on
to the floor
trying to find a little chaos in the order
So I take a bus ride
past your house every day
you never fully leave me
but you, you never fully stay
This is what you do to me
My tired eyes
are like
lonely stars
trying to find a little
order in the chaos
This is what you do
This is what you do to me
This is what you do
Come on
smile
smile
Come on
smile
smile
smile
smile
smile
smile
smile

In the darkest street
Far away from here
I can feel your skin stripped and bare
And my only threat
Is a burning cigarette
A smoking face upon me, me
So come on, yeah come on
It's in the music never gets you wrong
So come on, yeah come one
Insist upon it; jump up upon it, yeah
Thump, thump
Now my strength is weak
And the sinners lie sleeping
And you're all I want, come here, come here
And if only the night was forever I'd fight
For you, for you, for you, for you
So come on, yeah come on
It's in the music never gets you wrong
So come on, yeah come on
Insist upon it; jump up upon it, yeah
So come on, yeah come on
It's in the music never gets you wrong
So come on, yeah come on
And twist 'round on it; jump up upon it, yeah
Thump, thump
Now I see, I'm starting to feel
Here all you wait, running slow to here
And inside my space is a hidden place
I don't wanna wait 'cause I'm always waiting
So come on, yeah come on
It's in the music never gets you wrong
So come on, yeah come on
Insist upon it; jump up upon it, yeah
So come on, yeah come on
It's in the music never gets you wrong
So come on, yeah come on
And twist 'round on it; jump up upon it, yeah
Thump, thump

We came down by the factory
industrial yards where my father did work
When I was a boy, I went too far
I lost the thread in the darkest of space
If I become antique, you collect me
If I become cheap, then you'll respect me
My jumper is soaked in pig's blood
I'm coming out, looking for you
If you pull a hatchet
I'll pull something to match it
How about your wife?
I will give her a good life
My vehicle is in
your drive
Hey, I'm not that low
The wolves came on the radio
transmitting through a portal
in the snowy atlas mountains

When I was born in '61
They already had a hit
They worked so hard and they
Made it too
They really were very good
They deserved all their success
They earned it yes they did they didn't
Buy their respect
And everybody wanted to be like them
Everybody wanted to be the Beatles
And I really wanted to be like him
But he died
A legendary rock group
Like history now to read
Like a magical fairy tale that's hard to believe
But it really did happen
Four lads who shook the world
God bless them for what they done
God bless them for what they done

The roots are deep below ground
I like to walk with you in the evening
Up the hill and back down
I watch the mail boat from the clearing
My mind is so confused, I climb back on top of you
And I'm changing the ribbons in this old Underwood
Well, step put of your dress and I'll wear you like a hood
For a hood is a home for someone who lives alone
I draw a line from A to be
And what happens in between
It is an open mystery
As far as I can see
My mind is so confused, I climb back on top of you
And I'm changing the ribbons in this old Underwood
Well, step put of your dress and I'll wear you like a hood
For a hood is a home for someone who lives alone

There's another way out of this hole
Another way out of this hell
When you're trying so hard to hold on
Trying so hard to be well
There was a voice in the head said hold on
There might be an easier way
There's a chance that you might beat the swell
A chance that you might beat the waves
When you're coming apart at the seam
Holding on tight to the rail
When you're losing your sight of the dream
When you're coming apart at the seam
Drowning in every detail
When you're losing your sight of the dream
As the morning light glows on the bay
The greyhound bus leaves for the pier
And the people you pass on the way
Speak a language that isn't so clear
Ah, If only somebody could see
If only somebody could say
Well there might be a chance for the heal
A chance for a life to be saved
When you're coming apart at the seam
Holding on tight to the rail
When you're losing your sight of the dream
When you're coming apart at the seam
Drowning in every detail
When you're losing your sight of the dream

Dont the flowers at your feet smell sweet
Well, it sure smells sweet to me
And dont the moon way up high shine bright
Well, it sure shines bright to me
And dont the water on your lips feel good
Well, it sure feels good to me
And dont the lips on your lips feel good
Well, it sure feel good to me

Chardonnay, chardonnay
How I love you Chardonnay
As I reach to hold you with
My trembling hands
In my hands, my trembling hands
Chardonnay, Chardonnay
You'll be glad to hear me say
I will never need you more than I do now
In my hands my trembling hands
When I'm sad sad and blue
You are my friends constant and true
I dedicate this song to you
And I would like to take you
Home with me
Chardonnay, Chardonnay
I'm in love with your bouquet
You're so cold but you're
So beautiful tonight
In my hands, my trembling hands
Chardonnay, Chardonnay
You don't have a lot to say
But your silence has
A welcome touch today
In my hands, my trembling hands
When I'm sad, sad and blue you are
My friend constant and true
I dedicate this night to you
And I would like to take you home
With me, tonight
In my hands, my trembling hands

How much would you bet
That if I tried hard enough
I would spontaneously combust?
I wish I could disappear
And run away from all of my fears
I think I'm coming undone
So stay the night
I promise that I won't bite
'Cause without you there
I don't think I could close my eyes
How do I end up this way?
A constant knot in my gut
Tied with uncertainty and with lust
A classic case, I suppose
A haunted man who can't out run his ghosts
They're in my skin, in my bones
So stay the night
I promise that I won't bite
'Cause without you there
I don't think I could close my eyes

Well the mountain was so beautiful
That this guy built a mall and a pizza shack
Yeah, he built an ugly city because
He wanted the mountain to love him back
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
When you know that you won't get your heart in that stone
When you drop your tools and you stand alone
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
Well, when my love felt like another addiction
I held my breath and I packed my bags
And I went to the land of the monastery
And the sunshine children and the prayer flags
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
When you feel your soul go beyond your skin
When you know that's the way that it's always been
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
Well, I climbed a mountain and I thought about attachment
And I thought about the Buddhist King
He said, "You can keep your superpower
It just short circuits my country"
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
When you question what your desire is for
When you don't just figure that you just want more
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
Well, I love the way the world is your garden
And you plant your seeds and you let them grow
And you take things out of the ground just like
You take what comes, but you never know
Yeah, and the mountain is so beautiful
And we don't know if we're any good at all
And we give our love when we think we still need it
Yeah we give and give and fall and fall
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
When the giving is all that you ever get back
Oh, how long do you love like that
Can you tell me oh, how to love
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love

We are young, and on the run, we don't know much
You are mine, and I am yours, it's not a quick touch
As the sun is sure to rise, I will never leave your side
You will never be denied, couldn't leave you if I tried, you will always have a place in these arms
I will fight for you
I will fight for you
When you get down, I'll be around to keep your mind clear
When you are lost, I'll be the hand to lead you anywhere
I will keep you in the light, I will hold you for the night
You will never be denied, couldn't leave you if I tried, you will always have a place in these arms
I will fight for you
I will fight for you
And I wont let you fall apart, even if you're apart from me, darling, I am here to stay
And I wont let you fall apart, even if you're apart from me, darling, I am here to stay
But I will fight for you
And I, I will fight for you, oooh ooh
I will fight for you (I will fight for you, I want to fight for you x4)
And I will fight for you, for you, for you (I will fight for you, I want to fight for you x4)

Well, piece by piece and nail by nail
Itll all come down someday before the fires of hell
You let me in your house
You let me in your house
You let me in your house with a hammer
Set to tile or set to stone
Tit for tat and bone for bone
Im goin to set fire to your glamor
Well, it's now rock that candy shop

Run away and watch it burn
Ive got to set fire to your glamor
Rock that candy shop

Run away and watch it burn
Smell the ashes in the air
Of this silly game were sure to tire
Well, you let me in your house

You let me in your house with a hammer
Set to tile or set to stone
Tit for tat and bone for bone

Let it rock
Listen to me now, let it rock, let it rock now
Rock that candy shop

Riding down the highway with Cowboy Joe
Met Leonardo DiCaprio, Leo, he's tryin' to get away from
The unwanted advances of Eminem
Em's wearing drawstrings, lispin' along
Sayin', "Please, put me into your highway song"
I say, hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
Well, I would never be so dumb
To say they stole an election
They bought the damn thing fair and square
Emperor's in his underwear
Old King Cole's a merry old troll
Surgeon General smokes Marlboro
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
Commandment Three says 'Do Not Kill'
Amendment Two says 'Blood Will Spill'
God sits in his rocking chair
Two flat tires and one good spare
Britney Spears joins Cowboy Joe
With a hey and a ho and a do si do
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
West Palm Beach and Cheech
And Rae Dawn Chong, can't we all just get along?
Anchored down in Kodiak with a heart attack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now, By Joel
West Palm Beach and Cheech
And Rae Dawn Chong, can't we all just get along?
Anchored down in Kodiak with a heart attack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now, By Joel
Hanging out with Cowboy Joe
Keith Richards stops to say hello
I play my guitar, he plays along
With song after song, after song, after song
That I've played with the likes of him
Ain't never gonna settle for less, my friend
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great, on that great
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
I say hey, who's goin' my way
On that great Alaska highway
High five

[Verse 1]
You're not the person I thought you were
Now you live in my head no more
You're not the one that I'm here to love
You're just the one that I've stumbled on
[Chorus]
I'm not into you
Anymore
I'm not into you
Anymore
[Verse 2]
No longer you that I'm falling for
I got my feelings up off the floor
I gave my best yea I gave my all
But now I no longer make that call
[Chorus]

MRS JOHNSTONE
ONLY MINE UNTIL
THE TIME COMES ROUND
TO PAY THE BILL.
THEN I'M AFRAID.
WHAT CAN'T BE PAID
MUST BE RETURNED.
YOU NEVER, EVER LEARN,
THAT NOTHING'S YOURS,
ON EASY TERMS.
ONLY FOR A TIME,
I MUST NOT LEARN,
TO CALL YOU MINE.
FAMILIARISE
THAT FACE, THOSE EYES
MAKE FUTURE PLANS
THAT CANNOT BE CONFIRMED
ON BORROWED TIME,
ON EASY TERMS.
LIVING ON THE NEVER NEVER,
CONSTANT AS THE CHANGING WEATHER,
NEVER SURE
WHO'S AT THE DOOR
OR THE PRICE I'LL HAVE TO PAY
SHOULD WE MEET AGAIN
I WILL NOT RECOGNISE YOUR NAME.
YOU CAN BE SURE
WHAT'S GONE BEFORE
WILL BE CONCEALED.
YOUR FRIENDS WILL NEVER LEARN
THAT ONCE WE WERE
ON EASY TERMS.
LIVING ON THE NEVER NEVER,
CONSTANT AS THE CHANGING WEATHER,
NEVER SURE
WHO'S AT THE DOOR
OR THE PRICE I'LL HAVE TO PAY...
MRS LYONS
THEY'RE BORN, YOU DIDN'T NOTIFY ME.
MRS JOHNSTONE
COULDN'T I KEEP THEM FOR A FEW MORE DAYS,
THEY'RE A PAIR, THEY GO TOGETHER.
MRS LYONS
MY HUSBAND IS DUE BACK TOMORROW, MRS. JOHNSTONE.
I MUST HAVE MY BABY WE MADE AN AGREEMENT,
A BARGAIN. YOU SWORE ON THE BIBLE.
MRS JOHNSTONE
YOU'D BETTER SEE WHICH ONE YOU WANT
MRS LYONS
I'LL TAKE...
MRS JOHNSTONE
NO. DON'T TELL ME WHICH ONE. JUST TAKE HIM,
JUST TAKE HIM
LIVING ON THE NEVER NEVER,
CONSTANT AS THE CHANGING WEATHER,
NEVER SURE
WHO'S AT THE DOOR
OR THE PRICE I'LL HAVE TO PAY,
SHOULD WE MEET AGAIN...

(feat. Susie Suh)
I'm not sure what I'm doing here
I'm wondering what this day will bring
You're far away but you're still near
But I think that'll be ok with me
I'd settle things but I'm headstrong
Now it's just easier to fake my way
It's not that I can't resolve
It's just that I don't have much to say
Looking at those photographs
I cant' see who's right or wrong
I was your second hand
And you were just my temporary one

I fell down in that hole again
I am a lump of jelly
I am a dead fish
I look up at the blue sky
And I know that it's just
A temporary dive
Sometimes we tip toe
Sometimes we run
Sometimes we wander while
Looking at the sun
Sometimes we tip toe
Sometimes we run
Sometimes we wander while
Looking at the sun
Sitting on the cold dirt floor
I want to finish the counting of days on the walls
I build a ladder from broken wish bones
And square-shaped stones
That my friends threw down in the hole
Sometimes we tip toe
Sometimes we run
Sometimes we wander while
Looking at the sun
Sometimes we tip toe
Sometimes we run
Sometimes we wander while
Looking at the sun
And even though I read maps to avoid them
They change location every day
And somehow all of my traces they vanish
But shall one stay put
Shall one lay low
Shall one not go
Just to avoid this hole
Sometimes we tip toe
Sometimes we run
Sometimes we wander while
Looking at the sun
Sometimes we tip toe
Sometimes we run
Sometimes we wander while
Looking at the sun

Today must have been one of the strangest days
Some would say that you won't find love that way
The best days are not planned by common sense
By lack of time
You just happen to be where everything feels fine
It's a new secret I have found
From today I'll change my priorities around
I'm no longer in command, and people say
I'm off solid ground and you're to blame
But they don't understand, people never do
It's confusing, I don't expect them to
It's a new secret I have found
Today must have been one of the strangest days
I found a place where I could stay
And people say that it will kill me,
But they don't understand
People never do, but it makes sense to me
To be senseless to change my plans for you
It's a new secret I have found
And I'm off solid grounds for you

(Let me tell ya)
I see you girls
Checkin' out my trunks
I see you girls
Checkin' out the front of my trunks
I see you girls
Lookin' at my junk
Then checkin' out my rump
Then back to my sugalumps
When I shake it, I shake it all up
You probably think that my pants have the mumps
It's just my sugalumps, bump-ba-bumps
They look so good
That's why I keep 'em in the front
All the ladies checkin' out my sugalumps
They drive the ladies crazy
All these bitches
Checkin' out my britches
Put 'em in a trance
When I wear track pants
My dungarees
Make them hungry
Send 'em over the moon
When I don pantaloons
My sugalumps are two of a kind
Sweet and white and highly refined
Honeys try all kinds of tomfoolery
To steal a feel of my family jewelry
My cannonballs cause a kerfuffle
The ladies they hustle to ruffle my truffle
If you party with the Party Prince
You get two complimentary after-dinner mints
Girsl surround me when I'm stading on teh stoop
Givin' me gifts like, free chicken soup
Book tokens, free chicken soup
Standing on teh corner going, uhmst uhmst
uhmst uhmst
uhmst uhmst
We see you girls
Checkin' out our trunks
We see you girls
Checkin' out the front of our trunks
We see you girls
Lookin' at our junk
Checkin' out our rumps
Then back to our sugalumps
Chillin' at my store
Doin' my thing
When in walks a guy
With his dick in a sling
I'm like, "Holy shit!
What's happened to you?"
He said,
"How much will you give for the family jewels?"
I said, "Ten bucks."
He said, "No way!"
"Ten bucks and a Frisbee"
He said, "Okay."
Then I took his sugalumps
And put 'em up in a display
And sold them as hacky-sacks
Later that day
All the ladies they want a taste of my sugalumps
Sweet sugalumps,
All the ladies they want a taste of my sugalumps
Sweet sugalumps, yeah

Come on down to the creeps
Come on down to the creeps
(x 2)
Make me take the ride
Free drinks on tonight
Take some have a feast
Break me 'cause it keeps coming...
Down on either side
Bleeding in my mind
Waiting for the creeps
To kill my last believes
So come on down to the creeps
Come on
Come on down to the creeps
Come on down to the creeps
Come on
Walking to the claim
The creeps calling my name
They get me every-time
I'm bleeding and i'm getting
We go split before my eyes
Increase, double size
Lease out my brain
Am i insane to go...
...on down to the creeps
Come on down to the creeps(x5)
Come on
Come on down to the creeps
Holding back the key
Fading sanity
Blowing up my head
Reaching for my always loving...
Partner up in crime
Soaking up my mind
Filling up my glass
I'm gone, at last
So come on down to the creeps
(-repeat till the end-)

Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present they don't matter
Now the future's sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think it's not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute though I couldn't tell how to fall out
It's twenty seconds till the last call
You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know it's easy
Like we did it over summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
It's not a miracle we needed
No I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present 1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think it's not gonna stay anyway
I think it's overrated
For a minute though I couldn't tell how to fall out
It's twenty seconds till the last call
You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know it's easy
Like we did it over summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
You're going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
It's not a miracle we needed
No I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

It ain't hard to adore you
Drag you into my town
Put your guard down, explore you
And I'll always be around
I want to live in Jamaica
Yeah I wanna live in Jamaica
...let your hair down
How'd they get their nose
...let your hair down...
I'm in love with an anchor
I can floss with her tail
She's the island above me
And I can tell, I can tell
When you nally break my legs
And I can never leave the house again
Then I'll finally love you
And we can have some kids

When I am sad and weary
When all my hope is gone
And I can't put my finger on the time things first went wrong
I have a little secret I like to tell myself
And until now I haven't told anybody else
You may not see things my way
Like my method or my reasons
But you can't tell me that I'm wrong
There's no heart you can't melt
With a certain little smile
And no challenge should be faced
Without a little charm and a lot of style
So don't put your faith in time - she heals but doesn't change
And only a fool won't take the chance to stay the same
When I am sad and weary
When all my hope is gone
I walk around my house and think of you with nothing on
I have a list of things I go over in my mind
When I can just sit right back and watch the world unwind
You may not see things my way
I don't care 'cause I'm not asking
But you can't tell me that I'm wrong
There's no heart you can't melt
With a certain little smile
And no challenge should be faced
Without a little charm and a lot of style
So don't put your faith in time - she heals but doesn't change
And only a fool won't take the chance to stay the same
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

Choking on these words
You can leave now
Oh haven't you heard
You can leave now
We stand there like statues from different cities
Both warriors of the same war
Both victors of our territories
Why do I feel so small?
Oh you've got it all figured out
What will be will be
Fine work from a sailor's hand
Who's always running away
In between all your complex ideas
Found out how love should be
When you get the time to feel anything
Anything real for me
Oh you've got it all figured out
What will be will be
Fine words from a sailor's son
Who's always running away
I don't want your sympathy
Don't quote me another phrase
I understand all your philosophies
But it hurts me just the same

[Verse 1]
Can I tell ya'll a story
About my history
I'm sure a lot ya'll can relate to me
You see I'm from the ghetto
A place where me and my brother shared
The hardwood floor when the winter was cold
I'm talkin about the ghetto
said the ghet the ghet the ghet
I'm not going to stay here no
I got plans to get out of here
I see my name, big lights
Oh Lord I want to take some of that good life
I want to be
[Chorus]
I want to be
A superstar, go get them
Superstar,oh I want to be yeah
I've got be dreams
Of being a, superstar go get them
Superstar (a ghetto super star)
That is all I want to be
[Verse 2]
What you know about that hard knock life?
What you know about that ware fare life?
Scrape for dinner and government cheese
Praying for the Lord
Lord you bless me
Oh, and get grandmama out
Try to buy every Foot Locker out
Living ghetto fabolous no doubt
You know what I'm talking about
I want to be...
[Chorus]
Rolling out slamming cadillac doors
Holding down every homie I know
Never ever ever will I be broke
I want to be I want to be a ghetto superstar
Rolling out slamming cadillac doors
Never ever ever will I be broke
Holding down every homie I know
I want to be I want to be a ghetto superstar
[Talking]
And if some of ya'll went through what i went through
You know I just want ya'll to bob ya'll head
Cause you know every one didn't come from great homes
[Chorus]

I look to you
When I see nothing
I look to you
To see truth
And I look to you
When I feel nothing
And I look to you
To be
And I walk in a field with wings
I walk in a field with wings
I walk in a field with wings
I walk in a field with wings
I walk
To you
So tell me where to find you
And tell me where to go
Cause I've tasted all your affections
From my mind
My heart
My body
And my soul
And I walk in a field with wings
I walk in a field with wings
I walk in a field with wings
I walk in a field with wings
I walk
To you
To you
To you

We walked the aisles aimlessly
With our kills painlessly
And we go all the night without love
In the darkened lonely corners
Where we place our drive-through orders
And we go all the night without love
Without love
"Touch me" the graphic reads
On the magnetic athletic insole
She lets it go all its life without life
And can you imagine going to
"Got milk? dot com"
Do you go all the night without love
Without love
Well I once caused your cells to shimmer
And you once caused my cells to shimmer
Now we go all the night without love
Without love...

Oh the sun is shining far too bright
For it to still be night
Oh the air feels so cold, so cold and old
How can it be light?
Let's take a walk outside
See the world through teach others eyes
I wish I was your only one
I think you're beautiful but your hair is a mess
And your shoes are untied but that's what I love best
And I, I wish I was the one, your one and only sun and you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances
Fairy tale romances every single day
And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh I love you like a friend, but lets not pretend how I wish for something, wish for something more

The lights go on
The lights go off
When things don't feel right
I lie down like a tired dog
Licking his wounds in the shade
When I feel alive
I try to imagine a careless life
A scenic world where the sunsets are all
Breathtaking

Up in the sky, there is a village
And the people there are blue, I believe it's true
Up in the sky, people are happy
They love to sing and there is no need for a king
Up in the sky, nothing is insane
Like a rocket driven plane you can fly above the rain
Up in the sky, you just feel fine
There is no running out of time and you never cross a line
I never want to die
I wanna live in the sky
Up in the sky, you can fly
You will make it if you try
In the sky you are far away
Up in the sky you can sing
And you can do everything
And no matter what they say it's true
I'm going to the blue
Up in the sky, there's no religion
There are no cars and no phones and you can't not be controlled
Up in the sky, you just feel fine
There is no money making crime but a lot of good wine
I never want to die
I wanna live in the sky
Up in the sky, you can fly
You will make it if you try
In the sky you are far away
Up in the sky you can sing
And you can do everything
And no matter what they say it's true
I'm going to the blue
I'm going to the blue
Into the blue
Wanna live up in the sky
Wanna live up in the sky (2x)
Up in the sky
Up in the sky, you can fly
You will make it if you try
In the sky you are far away
Up in the sky you can sing
And you can do everything
And no matter what they say it's true (2x)
I'm going to the blue
Up in the sky (ohhh)
Up in the sky

One, two, three, four
Will is my friend
Will sings like John
Goin' back to California
Will is the West Coast with me
Will is a past is a plenty
Will is a blue friend of mine
With whom I spend a whole lot of my time
The lemon tree it laughs at me
It's growin' beautifully
The little veins it would unwind
And it'll wrap your whole in time
Now let's have a glass of wine
Now let's have another glass of wine
This is the water in which we wade
This is our father, this is how he strayed
This is the wind and this is the breeze, Will
Will is my friend
Will sings like John
Goin' back to California

Eyes rolled back guess we were living fast
Where did you go, yeah where did you go?
Your eyes go to show
That it was so rare to see you sober
And so the streetlights would carry us home
And I spent my nights trying to get a grip of you
And I did my best to get my hands under your jacket
So we could make a racket
But your divine ribs would help break mine
We hit the ground so let's hit the ground
She said nothing's alright, believe me
I won't feel the same in the mornin'
She said nothing's alright, we're leavin
And I won't feel the same in the mornin'
Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin us away
Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin us away

1, 2, 3, 4
Little yellow spider, laughing at the snow
Ah, maybe that spider knows something that I don't know
'Cause I'm Goddamn cold
Little white monkey, staring at the sand
Well, maybe that monkey figured out something I couldn't understand
Who knows?
Well, I came upon a dancing crab, and I stopped to watch it shake
I said, "Dance for me just one more time
Before you hibernate and you come out a crab cake"
Hey there, little snapping turtle, snapping at a shell
Ah, there's mysteries inside, I know
But what they are I just can't tell for sure
And hey ya', little baby crow, you're looking kinda' mean
I think I outta spit before you start letting off your steam
For sure
And hey there, little sexy pig, you made it with a man
And you're got a little kid with hooves instead of hands
And oh, all the animals
All the animals
And hey there, little mockingbird, they sing about you in songs
Ah, where you been?
Have you broke a wing?
I haven't heard you in so long
And hey there, little albatross, swimming in the air
Ah c'mon, you know I can't fly
And I, I think we really outta play fair
And hey there, Mr. Happy Squid, you move so psychedelically
You hypnotize with your magic dance all the animals in the sea
For sure
And oh, all the animals
All the animals
And hey there, Mr. Morning Sun, what kind of creature are you?
I can't stare, but I know you're there
Goddamn, how I wish I knew
And hey there, Mrs. Lovely Moon, you're lonely and you're blue
It's kinda' strange, the way you change
But then again, we all do too

My wolf sings, he doesnt bark like a dog.
His mum was killed in the hands of a man.
He was next at only 6 weeks old.
These fools playing God I just dont understand.
My, my Malakai
My, my Malakai
This lady is screaming at the top of her lungs,
She said I saw your fool in my back yard,
I said no he was here as he licked his lips.
Eating old chucks is just one if his tricks.
My, my Malakai
My, my Malakai
She wasnt happy, she called the cops.
The pigs came around and said hes gotta go.
So we took him out to see his friends.
He came back crying with a needle and a thread
My, my Malakai
My, my Malakai

There's a funeral procession on the highway
Traffic screeches to a halt
There's people searching for a better way
To live their lives, oh
Johnny lived a good life, you'll hear them say
As tears of sadness soak the ground
The reaper crept in, took his breath away
In the middle of the night, oh
We celebrate the lives of the dead
It's like a man's best party, only happens when he dies
We gather 'round to pay our respects
While their souls are still searching for the light
Searching for the light
So please don't come to me on my dying day
Just let me go in peace
With all the things that I forgot to say
Racing through my mind, oh
And don't you bury me six feet under ground
Just burn my body in a box
And let my ashes blow with the wind
Out into the night sky
We celebrate the lives of the dead
It's like a man's best party, only happens when he dies
We gather 'round to pay our respects
While their souls are still searching for the light
Searching for the light
Searching for the light, oh
Searching for the light

Walking in the shadows of mankind
Drinking from the dust in the streets
Living through the seasons having 1000 reasons
Trying to make ends meet
Flipping coins and lights in September
Dancing with the leaves of July
February pavements seem to hold resentments
Against me as time's flying by
Gotta get home, gotta get home in December
When the lights are shining bright
Gotta get back to what I remember
And then everything's alright
Tell my mum I'm coming home in December
I have seen the Eiffel Tower in Paris
And I have seen the squares of New York
I been sleeping next to towers, singing songs for hours
Finding comfort in being a dork
Playing with the whales in the ocean
Climbing on a mountain with blue eyes
And under porches and bridges I've learned that all the riches
Are waiting for me in disguise
Gotta get home, gotta get home in December
When the lights are shining bright
Gotta get back to what I remember
And then everything's alright
Tell my mum I'm coming home in December
I want to go back, I need to go back home
My friends are waiting for me to come back home
And everybody's there and we have things to share
And the family prayer, something is in the wind and I know for sure
Deep down in the core, now it's time to go
To my loved ones, I need to go back home
Gotta get home, gotta get home in December
When the lights are shining bright
Gotta get back to what I remember
And then everything's alright
Tell my mum I'm coming home in December
I want to go back home
I want to get back home

She said, "Love, love, love is everything"
I said, "Okay, I guess, whatever"
She said, "What does that mean?"
I said, "Nothing, it's just good to have a backup plan"
She said, "I guess that means you don't got love"
I said, "Maybe I love everyone"
She said, "That's the same as loving no one"
I said, "Okay, I guess, whatever"
I have a dream of a new American language
One with a little bit more Spanish
I have a dream of a new pop music
That tells the truth with a good beat and some nice harmonies
I have a dream
I have a dream
Tourist towns are a drag sometimes
But in non-tourist towns, you can get beat up
Just for looking a little different
I guess the thing to do is just stay at home
Yeah, but sometimes I think the thing to do
Would be to get a place way out in Missouri
Put down as many months' rent as you can part with
Tell everybody else you went to France
I said, "Remember that conversation we had about love?
Well, I think you were right"
She said, "I don't remember saying nothing about love
It must have been a fantasy of the moment"
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream of Michaelangelo on that ceiling
Working through weekend to make more money
I have a dream of replacing Steve Kerr on the Bulls
And being the little white guy they let shoot the threes
I dream of joining the Mafia
And whether people like me is unimportant
I dream of your clock radio
Waking you up with my songs
I have a dream of a new American language
I dream of new beginnings
I dream of saturation bombing
I dream mostly about love
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream

upstairs Europe stars
I would stare but nothing there is like you are
asleep in those cold arms
outside a lonely night
sizes up the sight and
I slide the covers over my eyes
you know I can't sleep otherwise
our trouble grows and grows
speeds and slows
rides and rolls in the slow
eyes low in our oslo
but high enough to see your
awakened bright eyes shining blue into
another dream
that's so you
and so I try to sing something meaningful
but I'm hitting all the wrong notes

I'm wasted, losing time
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but we're not right
In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator
I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place
To lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a' mess I leave
To follow
In the darkness I will meet my creators
They will all agree, I'm a suffocator

Gods of iron clashing, wind in battle through the night
Tears will fall, and strength is needed to overcome
This old house is full of leaks and mold on the walls
Dragons of the mind are lurking in the shadows
Torrents wash away
Everything
Raindrops flowing all around
Queen takes King, the pawns are falling onto the ground
Over you and me, there is rising the pink moon
Merciless though the wind takes hold with freezing cold
Come, my friend, sit with me, take council in the warmth
Torrents wash away
Everything
Raindrops flowing all around

There are emeralds in the moon glow
And storms raging through my mind
Just a whisper in the shadows
And I fell into the night
Won't you let me out?
Won't you let me out?
No, I tried so hard
Don't lead me away, no, we've come so far
Are you there at all?
Are you there at all?
Won't you break my fall?
Don't lead me away, no, we've come so far
A careless sun was shining brightly
And the crows start circling
As the skies cried black lightning
Lord knows that I fell, that I fell
But how far, I'll never tell
Won't you let me out?
Won't you let me out?
No, I tried so hard
Don't lead me away, no, we've come so far
Are you there at all?
Are you there at all?
Won't you break my fall?
Don't lead me away, no, we've come so far
I look for you every night, love
I search all my dreams
In my mind, you'll always be shining
An emerald in the moon glow
Won't you let me out?
Won't you let me out?
No, I tried so hard
Don't lead me away, no, we've come so far
Are you there at all?
Are you there at all?
Won't you break my fall?
Don't lead me away, no, we've come so far
We've come so far

NARRATOR
THERE'S A FEW BOB IN YOUR POCKET
AND YOU'VE GOT GOOD FRIENDS,
AND IT SEEMS THAT SUMMER'S NEVER COMING TO AN END
YOUNG, FREE AND INNOCENT, YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CARE,
APART FROM DECIDIN' ON THE CLOTHES YOU'RE GONNA WEAR.
THE STREET'S TURNED INTO PARADISE,
THE RADIO'S SINGING DREAMS
YOU'RE INNOCENT, IMMORTAL, YOU'RE JUST FIFTEEN.
AND WHO'D DARE TELL THE LAMBS IN SPRING
WHAT FATE THE LATER SEASONS BRING
WHO'D TELL THE GIRL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAIR
THE PRICE SHE'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR JUST BEING THERE.
BUT LEAVE THEM ALONE, LET THEM GO AND PLAY
THEY CARE NOT FOR WHAT'S AT THE END OF THE DAY
FOR WHAT IS TO COME, FOR WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
LIFE HAS NO ENDING WHEN YOU'RE SWEET SIXTEEN
AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE WITH YOU TO TALK AWAY THE NIGHT
OR UNTIL MRS Wang SWITCHES OFF THE CHIPPY LIGHT
THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE CORNER
AND THE STREET LAMP'S GLARE
AN' ANOTHER HOUR TO SPEND, WITH YOUR FRIENDS, WITH HER,
TO SHARE YOUR LAST CIGARETTE AND YOUR SECRET DREAM
AT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR...
... AT SEVENTEEN
IT'S JUST ANOTHER FERRY BOAT, A TRIP TO THE BEACH
BUT EVERYTHING'S POSSIBLE,
THE WORLD'S WITHIN YOUR REACH
AN' YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE THE BROKEN BOTTLES IN THE SAND
THE OIL IN THE WATER AND YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW LIVING COULD BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A DREAM
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, FREE AND INNOCENT...
... AND JUST EIGHTEEN.
AND ONLY IF THE THREE OF THEM COULD STAY LIKE THAT FOREVER,
AND ONLY IF WE COULD PREDICT NO CHANGES IN THE WEATHER
AND ONLY IF WE DIDN'T LIVE IN LIFE, AS WELL AS DREAMS
AND ONLY IF WE COULD STOP AND BE FOREVER,
JUST EIGHTEEN.

I once fell in love with you
Just because the sky turned from gray
Into blue
It was a good friday
The streets were open and empty
No more passion play
On st. Nicholas avenue
I believe in st. Nicholas
Its a different type of santa claus

I wish I could do better by you
'Cause that's what you deserve
You sacrifice so much of your life
In order for this to work
While I'm off chasing my own dreams
Sailing around the world
Please, know that I'm yours to keep
My beautiful girl
When you cry a piece of my heart dies
Knowing that I may have been the cause
If you were to leave, fulfill someone else's dreams
I think I might totally be lost
You don't ask for no diamond rings
No delicate string of pearls
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One, two, one, two, three, four
I wish I could do better by you
'Cause it's what you deserve
You sacrifice so much of your life
In order for this to work
While I'm off chasing my own dreams
Sailing around the world
Please, know that I'm yours to keep
My beautiful girl
And when you cry a piece of my heart dies
Knowing that I may have been the cause
If you were to leave and fulfill someone else's dreams
I think I might totally be lost
But you don't ask for no diamond rings
No delicate string of pearls
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
But you don't ask for no diamond rings
No delicate string of pearls
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl

Lay me down in the daylight moments
Follow you around to your place
And I'll just sit here and watch you
Making waves, making waves
And there is no sea at all
I don't know how you do it
So full to your belly with sand
I could just sit here forever and watch you
Making waves, oh you're making waves
I watch you making waves
Where there's no sea at all
Making waves
Oh you're making waves
I watch you making waves
Oh you're making waves

The heater's on
The windows are thin
I'm trying hard
To keep this warmth in
I turn to her
She's sound asleep
Someplace I don't know
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go
[Chorus]
I tried to tell you
I can only say it when were apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet heart.
Two hours on
My eyes are open
There's bad blood between us
What did I say
That made you cry?
Our dream won't die
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go.
[Chorus]
What is that light?
that small red light
Scorpio rising
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go
[Chorus]

I spilled the ink across the page trying to spell your name
So I fold it up and I flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It wont fly the seven seas to you
Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands of someone else
The garbage man
Got to say mm mm mm
Got to say mm mm mm
So he opens it up and reads it out to all his friends
Amongst the crowd a heart will break and a heart will mend
He walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his hand
He reaches out only to catch the sky
Its gone with the wind
Got to say mm mm mm
Got to say mm mm mm
I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down there it goes
Paper aeroplane
It hasn't flown the seven seas to you
But its on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone else
To find you girl
Got to say mm

Feels much better now I've the life I was due
No more disorder in your opposing view
Looks deceiving, premonitions, I've got mine
A hundred hearings, see me smiling every time
Now that
I can do no wrong
Lately
But I could do no wrong
Then
And I'll save you from reason
The smell of sulfur
Yeah I can do no wrong
Feels much better now I've the life I was due
Sunday's soldiers laid out, now I can't lose
And in your fading, prearranged and made up mind
Everything's the cure, nothing is the crime
Nobody hates my term cause I'm so young and nobody hates my term
I can't wait my turn cause I'm not young and I can't wait my turn

My heart is a black haunted loom,
Weaving jackets for children who'll never be born.
My hands are abandoned factories
Manufacturing heartbreak and hate for the world.
As we waltz the broken dance of our limbs
This ballroom has been groped by so many evil whims.
As I drill the last hole into you,
The well of your body has hardened into glue.
Everything is going to be just awful when we're around.
All the colors gonna rot off your sight when we're around.
I remember the day that I sold my smile to that nice couple
Who lost their first child.
I threw in a set of sympathy,
And a bucket of popcorn for the cemetary.
But now my face is all fenced off, the sky is boarded up,
The hills covered in drop cloth.
How many chords till this song vomits out real love?
How many feathers to pluck naked the soiled dove?
How many whores till you send away for that trophy?
And how many punches till you give yourself away for free?
Because those bruises on your gace look like the sun setting in disgrace.
(From these cliffs you can see the whole city
Laid out groveling like a field of wounded soldiers.
The billboards in heat and hissing,
The sky scrapers stitching the gash of the earth.
As they waltz the broken dance of their limbs
Their ballroom has been groped by so many evil whims.)
Everything is going to be just awful when we're around.
All the colors gonna rot off your sight when we're around.
I am just a salesman pleased to meet you can I show you around.
Every thing must go the shadows the seagulls when we're around.
This is our shame.

... now my barbaric body
becomes an easy prey
to every wildanimal
and every wind
shall breath in the shadow
of every numbness tree
murmuring and whispering for his hideous sin
julia went down
down down to the ground
to hell and never coming back
to hell, julia went down she'll never return anymore
ablazed and graft down
and yet blossom as spring in its pride
with apples like condemned devil heads
and julia is no more
as she walked out the door
from which she'll never be returning
while she went down
now her soul is scald
in tartaros' streams
and feeds at hell' deadly tree,
beyond lethe, beyond bitterness fruit
demon's dwelling
in iron of hungry flames
her soul is seeking into orcus' sea of flames
julia went down
down down to the ground

The first part of every day for me is good
I've got the bus stop in my neighborhood
And everything's on purpose everywhere they go
Hiding in my car and running in the snow
Running with the friends they'll know for years
I've seen it all from here, from here
It happens every day, before they go to school
They play until the bus drives up beside my lawn
And there's always been a mother who waits 'til they are gone
Then she turns away
It happens every day
Noon comes and turns this campus upside down
I watch the students in this college town
You would think they're carefree, I have seen their trials
Frowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles
Even underlining Nabokov
When I am not in love, in love
It happens every day with their journals in cafes
Looking up at their reflection on the other wall
With every new idea wondering if they've changed at all
And then they look away
It happens every day
Well life is as hard and as easy as they say
Walking the steps we've chosen on this day
Some will be outrageous, some have rarely shown
Some will walk in couples, some will walk alone
As I think about the world I see
They stare and smile at me, at me
It happens every day at the crossing of the street
Walking out to see what's new and what is just the same
And the only word for love is everybody's name
And that will always stay
It happens every day
And every day will happen without you

These hot machine years burning time across your face
See the smoke stacks rising up like fuck you towers?
My girlfriend sang like a hummingbird today
until that cough stole her voice and fed it to the furnance.
Shrew laugh, trench throat..
There's a party on the 16th floor.
this apartments paper thin walls....
you know your neighbors sobs by heart.
Tight coil, cold grin...
Highways wrapped around my body like a snake.
Got a view of a cement lawn, amputated horizons.
Thanks for the survival rags.
thanks for the soiled skies.
thanks for the fucked up future.
We can learn to love misery.
Was it just last night
that I woke up to a snarling baby?
Did I hear it right?
He begged his mother, Feed me to the forest!
The factory is singing us to sleepless beds tonight.
Lungs like twin garbage sacks sucking charcoal breath tonight.
Sick squeal, dull moan...
Looks like your neighbors found another victim.
Screams Help but no one comes.
honey won't you turn the TV on?
Brown summer, stench wind...
the globe spinning on a rusty hinge.
Get in your car go to your job
like a train that's being robbed.

I tried to repress it, then I carried its crown
I reached out to undress it and love let me down
Love let me down
So I tried to erase it, but the ink bled right through
Almost drove myself crazy when these words led to you
And all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you and then color me in
Well, I tried to control it and cover it up
I reached out to console it
It was never enough, never enough
So I tried to forget it, that was all part of the show
Told myself I'd regret it, but what do I know
About all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dogless bone
So come let me love you
Come let me love you and then color me in
Come let me love you
Come let me take this through the end
Of all these useless dreams of living in all these useless dreams
All these useless dreams of living in all these old noes
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me

The grass is screaming long
Midnight cars roll past
I've been chasing your room
While the summer lasts
So count it on your fingers
If we got it wrong
It's cause the days have no numbers
If we leave tonight
And we leave it all behind
Drinking alphabetically
Cause the beauty's gone all sore
Honey dripping, paler skin
While there's bodies underneath, the floor
So count it on your fingers
If we got it wrong
It's cause the days have no numbers
If we leave tonight
And we leave it all behind

The shore worn
and born black
I love that
I love that
Seaside
Seaside
The hunter in heaven
is thunder a companion by
My side
My side
Now seen Unseen
Now seen Unseen
The sea is calm
The path on high
It swoops down
to lye by
Your side
Your side
Your side

Oh love
Right from the start
You were old love
Like we've never been parted
You kissed me
Your hands down my side to my hips
Still shivers inside
All the breathing
From your mouth through mine
About how long
There's hunger for one more time
Lover of mine, when I kissed you
I felt so good, tell this tale to me
Well I won't believe
That I'm already here
Tell this tale to me
No, I won't believe
That we're already here
Oh love, you covered my skin
With your eyes as they found me
I kissed you, danced in your sand
And fell into a never ending moment
And the whisper from your mouth through mine
With those words that gently filled my lungs
Lover of mine, when I'm with you
I forget how am I to being lonely
Living without you
Spend another day passing by you
Don't wanna know how it feels if I do
Tell this tale to me
No, I won't believe
That I'm already here
Tell this tale to me
I won't believe
That we're already here

You took the car
It was my favorite one
Little white Dart
And drove it to Idaho
You took the rug
Red and white checker board
Rolled it right up
And took it to Idaho
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You took the horse
It was a thoroughbred
Saddled it up
Out on the interstate
You took my kid
It was my only one
Smart little bitch
And drove her to Idaho
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You took the house
I went and changed the locks
Now I am stuck
Living another box
You took the car
It was my favorite one
Little white Dart
And drove it to Idaho
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine

You were my heart flower my poetry my song
Just one look at you and then I knew
On that day, serendipity smiled down on me
Time flew by swiftly; life was filled with dance and song
But it wasn't long before I learnt
On that day, you don't get to call the shots that way
I still think about the possibility of love
I see reflections of that moment now
From that day, just a fleeting glimpse that will not stay
You were my heart flower my poetry my song
But it wasn't long before I learnt
On that day, you don't get to call the shots that way
You don't get to call the shots that way
You don't get to call the shots that way

Tell me what you see
Is it close to what you dreamed
If I play a part
Can I be redeemed?
We pore through the passages
The leather volume shelves
But they only leave us wondering
Can we find ourselves
In the book of love, oh,
In the book of love
Looking for the one
Waiting on a day
Countless dinner parties
And all the games we play
Often sung processional
Solemn wedding vow
A picture in a picture frame
That beauty can allow
In the book of love, oh
In the book of love
And love becomes a temple
And we begin to feel
Then an unfeeling oracle
Will say you did come near
But you are not welcome here
This is who I am
All the places that I've been
Fondness and regret
Every love that I've been in
And I've played all the characters
The fool, the friend, the wife
And no matter what the ending is
The story of my life
Is the book of love, oh,
Is the book of love

Be my husband, I'll be your wife
Be my husband, I'll be your wife
Be my husband, I'll be your wife
Outside you there is no place to go.
If you want me to I'll cook and sew
If you want me to I'll cook and sew
If you want me to I'll cook and sew
Outside you there is no place to go.
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Please don't treat me so doggone mean
Please don't treat me so doggone mean
Please don't treat me so doggone mean
you're the meanest man I ever seen
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Stick to the promise man, that you made me
Stick to the promise man, that you made me
Stick to the promise man, that you made me
That you'll stay away from Rosalie
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good

I won't live up to any expectations
What you see is what you get
And worse yet I can't give an explanation
For why it's gray on your side
But from me the sun can't hide
Somehow in the city it's summer in the city
Somewhere in the city it's summer in the city
I will rise up to every day's occasion
What you reach is what you get
And better yet I'll give you an indication
For why you're feeling deprived
But with me you come alive
Somehow in the city it's summer in the city
Somewhere in the city it's summer in the city
No more raining on this lonely town
Summer comes around when you really want it
Immortalized, young forever now
There's more to life than running in the circles you become
No more raining on this lonely town
Summer comes around when you really want it
Immortalized, young forever now
C'mon and spend the summer with me
We won't give into any hesitation
What you need is what you get
We'll never let lack of an imagination
Keep us locked up inside
Even when the sun has died
Somehow in the city it's summer in the city
Somewhere in the city it's summer in the city
No more raining on this lonely town
Summer comes around when you really want it
Immortalized, young forever now
There's more to life than running in the circles you become
No more raining on this lonely town
Summer comes around when you really want it
Immortalized, young forever now
C'mon and spend the summer with me

I'm spending my time,
Walking spirals in line,
Did I ever honestly believe,
A change of mind,
And then a change of position,
Only action no reaction no,
This time is mine, together we can't spend it anyway,
Nothing is gonna change nothing is ever gonna change
And I'm a trigger,
You're my gun
Don't you wanna come,
Don't you taste the times that come,
Back and forth in one,
Don't you wanna come,
If I could take you to a better place
She is a monument,
And everyone is talking,
Like a vision it's all crystal clear,
A change of mind and then a change of position,
Did we ever honestly believe,
Watching dead bodies and bombs falling from the sky,
Nothing's gonna change, nothing is ever gonna change
And I'm a trigger,
You're my gun,
Don't you wanna come,
Don't you taste the times that come,
Back and forth in one

this boy and girl were lovers
came from different towns
now they both live in the same one
see each other round
he saw her at the rose bowl
just the other day
she showed him what she bought there
and they struggled for what to say
they say we're made mostly of water
so how come we can't find the sea?
they say true love creeps up on you slowly
oh how blind some people can be
this boy and girl had troubles
lasted fifteen rounds
both threw in the towel
no one took the crown
and time it tends to pass us
as we look the other way
now he sells insurance
and she's in a non-union play
oh how i wish we were like water
we'd float on down into the sea
if you find true love at your door knocking
invite her in make her some tea
this boy and girl were lovers
came from different towns
now they both live in the same one
see each other round
they say we're made mostly of water
so how come we can't find the sea?
they say true love creeps up on you slowly
oh how blind some people can be

Your message said you'd be okay
I hate it when you lie to me
But I am just too far away
To help much to calm your sea
The hanging judge is at your door
The serpent's underneath your bed
You summon all your angels out
They tell you it's in your head
And this may hurt for just a while
But it always comes out right
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
When all the secret codes you know
Can't seem to unlock the door
And all the road that led you home
Don't arrive there anymore
Don't scare yourself by thinking that
You've lose your only light
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
When all the pretty temples you built
Make you want to tear them down
You're crying over milk you spilled
Long before it hit the ground
Pull your mad genie back inside
And screw the lid on tight
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight

Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
Don't the sun look good today?
But the rain on its way
Watch the butcher shine his knives
And this town is full of battered wives.
Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
I ride your river under the bridge
I take your boat out to the reach
'Cause I love that engine roar
But I still don't know what I'm here for
Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town
They shut it down
They closed it down
They shut it down
They pulled it down
Round and round up and down
Through the streets of your town
Everyday I make my way
Through the streets of your town

Renata, you have put me down,
Like a toy you no longer need around.
Renata, you have told me 'no',
Like a coin that's tossed, I don't know where to go.
Am I a fool for hangin' on for you, Renata, like I do?
Am I a fool for hangin' around? Make up your mind. I'll be here when you do.
Face into the truth, when you put your back into it, it's gonna startle you.
Face into the truth, what you're putting out is coming back to you.
Renata, will I understand,
I might not have what it takes to be your man?
Renata, one day you will see,
The simple joy just being around you brought me.
Am I a fool for stickin' 'round for you,
Renata, like I do.
Am I a fool for hangin' on, make up your mind,
I'll be here when you...
Face into the truth, put your back into it, it looks good on you,
Face into the truth, what you're putting out, it's gonna startle you,
Startle you, oh...
La la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la lo.
Oh.
La la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la lo.
Face into the truth, will you think about it, what else would you do?
Face into the truth, it's not about giving up, it's about me and you.
Me and you.
Oh.
Face into the truth, what you're putting out, it's gonna startle you,
Startle you. Oh.
Face into the truth, put your back into it, it looks good on you,
Good on you. Oh.
La la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la lo.
Yeah.
La la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.

I'll come based on facts like she'll be there
Making self-control leave me
And she'll stand this out in bricks to the rioters
I can't believe you're twenty six
Without having a few in my fist
'Cause you've got a mind that is so hell bent on
Fixing me up before I get my coat off
You with those hands that are so hell bent on
Making a mess to suggest you'd think something
I'll come based on facts like we're always screaming
But I still love you tearing me up at the seams
And she'll stand this out in bricks to the rioters
I can't believe you're twenty six
Without having a few in my fist
'Cause you've got a mind that is so hell bent on
Fixing me up before I get my coat off
You with those hands that are so hell bent on
Making a mess to suggest you'd think something
You see, I don't know why
I know now
I would not, have been less tempted
To get you on top
Touch of pace, I'd have been good to you, babe
You've got a mind that is so hell bent on
Fixing me up before I get my coat off
'Cause you with those hands that are so hell bent on
Making a mess to suggest you'd think something
You with those hands that are so hell bent on
Making a mess to suggest you'd think something

Time travels to learn
Your secret life
In your mausoleum
And Berlin
Is so ugly in the morning light
But with them
I could never feel so right

Lonely soldier go home
Lonely, but never alone
Good eyes see nothing to shoot
Good feet feel good giving up good boots
So ask your father how'd you fall
Ask your father how'd you fall
Like a leaf sitting on the ground
Good for nothing 'cept kicking around
She died with her hands stretched out
She died with a hungry mouth
She died with her mind full of doubt
And thoughts of weakening
So may your river never dry
And may your mouth never lie
And may you be satisfied to never know why
Sometimes someone just wants to die
So where'd you get those cuts in your hand
I thought I told you about playing in the sand
There's always someone careless with glass
There's always questions you don't want to ask.
She died with her hands stretched out
She died with a hungry mouth
She died with her mind full of doubt
And thoughts of weakening
So may your river never dry
And may your mouth never lie
And may you be satisfied to never know why
Sometimes someone just wants to die
So lonely soldier go home
Lonely, but never alone
Good eyes see nothing to shoot
Good feet feel good giving up good boots

Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?

You wanted to buy me
For a hundred euro
You said you'd take me
To your little car
Your friend lived near by
He had a house and all
Where was i from you said
You guessed yugoslavia
Well it's not yogoslavia
It's not yugoslavia at all
It reminded me
Of a movie i just saw
About a little girl
From yugoslavia
She got sent away
They made her prostitute
She ate mcdonald's all day
And never had a chance to play
Lyla
You wanted to buy me

But it's not yugoslavia
It's hardly yugoslavia at all

So falling I again in the aiding tar,
So stall the light and speak to me in the car.
Say something to stop the sound of the siren calls,
Say something to silence all of the sounding stalls away.
So bye, so bowing on again,
To go where the April Isle I know,
Bowing on again and so.
So falling I again in the sinking arc,
So stall the night and drive to the aiding dark.
Say something to stop the flash of the siren calls,
Say something to silence all of the sounding stalls away.
So bye, so bowing on again,
To go where the April Isle I know,
Bowing on again and so.

With our hands
and call it broken promised land
I heard the whispers on the wind
he told me how or this would end
hey, our eye on the horizon
don't stop until it's gone
hey, our eye on the horizon
and think alone now on our hearts
and give a peace recover every day
and we both fight and no one sees
that's free ourselves away from here
hey, our eye on the horizon
don't stop until it's gone
hey, our eye on the horizon
hey, our eye on the horizon
don't stop until it's gone
hey, our eye on the horizon
hey,
hey,

Black widow and white wood
The darkness of a forest eerily returns
To stagger drunk like mud
Taking swings at your woman
Run!!!
Why does butterscotch taste so good
And we can't have any
But we must we should
Why does sugar cane taste so good
Even though sugar can only do ya harm
You remind me of baseball
Tow trucks and the movies
Look sweet as to deliver me milk
Almost frozen on those wintry mornings
Don't slip mr. Mail man
Watch out for my dog!!!
Why does kissin' you feel so good
Even though it ain't alowed
I know we shouldn't should
Why does holdin' hands feel so right
Got a bruise on my pinky ring from holdin' too tight
Black diamonds swoon the corner
Make it sparkle
Its all for sale
Pushin' snow on the summer kids
Lewd remarks lowering
Lick the lips mischievous
Lick the lips mischievous
Skittles are the rainbow
And every color's popular though
Red gets the most invitations
To the jr. High celebrations
And i'll go alone i don't care
'Cause rainbow's not my favorite color
I'll go alone i don't care
It's not my favorite color
Why does butterscotch taste so good
And we can't have any
But we must we should
And why does sugar cane taste so good
Even though sugar can only do ya harm
I'll go alone i don't care
It's not my favorite color
Black widow and white wood

See her come down, through the clouds
I feel like a fool
I ain't got nothing left to give
Nothing to lose
So come on Love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around
Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one
I see them snakes come through the ground
They choke me to the bone
They tie me to their wooden chair
Here are all my songs
So come on Love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around
Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one
The only
Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one
The only one
The only one
The only one
The only one
So come on Love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around
The only

Studies have shown that we like sheep are prone
To sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis
But don't be sympathetic, just pass the anesthetic
'Cuz sheep are benign and on the young we will dine
Burn her pale blue shroud and tread on her bones
The din of the boys' club crowd reveals we've always been clones
Oh, this being true you know there's more than just two
In the cards are four aces so turn and shoot at twelve paces
Studies have shown that we like sheep are prone
To sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis
But don't be sympathetic, just pass the anesthetic
'Cuz sheep are benign and on their young we will dine
Burn her pale blue shroud and tread on her bones
The din of the boys' Club crowd reveals we've always been clones
Oh, this being true you know there's more than just two
So, tie up your laces for the gene pool race of races

all of the words keep coming
for me to settle down
but i think i heard us falling
before we hit the ground
so much for my dark takes
on how we got this far
funny that we can't make a thing
of what we really are
* she sits on the bed
she's so beautiful
she thinks i'll be scared of what she's feeling
it's time you ought to know
time you had the facts,
"i'm feeling like this, if you can live with that."
i don't believe in some things
like living for myself
and i don't believe in loving
unless there's someone else

Trying to take that midnight train
But it's gone and broken down again
Now I'm stuck on Empty Avenue
Trying to get to you
Talking on the telephone
Only makes me feel more alone
Killing time with a chosen few
Trying to get to you
In this world of constant danger
I still look for kindness in strangers
And why oh why and why is not enough
And we cry oh cry our tears are not enough
Through firestorms and hurricanes
I'm 16 hours on an airplane
10 thousand miles of ocean view
Trying to get to you
In this world of constant danger
I still look for kindness in strangers
And why oh why and why is not enough
And we cry oh cry our tears are not enough
Walking through the driving rain
Just the thought of you remains
Lines are down I can't get through
Trying to get to you
Lines are down I can't get through
Trying to get to you

In my life on earth
the things I have invented have invented me
I found my industry
I am not alone
I fashion friends from precious scraps
they hold the light they bend to serve me
joking that they dont deserve me
after days of craft and care
I lift a sword and slice the air
Such has been my time upon this earththis earth
Then my wife returns
more beautiful then when she left the night before
I show her things I made
The filigree of ferns, diamonds, snowflakes, tears of gold
She murmurs praise, a small caress; I smile to see her happiness
Silver webs with sand engrained
that catch and hold real drops of rain
Such has been my toil upon this earththis earth
When Im feeling vexed I go upstairs and bury something deep
Then stand back and push a button, from a distance watch the earth explode
This earth
I love this land of mortal men
They wake to know the fire again
The things we make, the things we feel,
Armored plates and molten steel
All of these inventions of the earth..the earththis earth..

Don't let this affect the game every five months we act the same
But I never get used to putting you off
And no one could've scripted this who knows what'll come of it
I refuse to believe it was all just a waste
[Chorus]
Cause look around
Everybody's on the food chain
Funny but from day to day we get bottom to top
And if you get lost you start over again
But we don't ever get to no we don't ever get to stop
I wake up in the oblivious state go to sleep trying to save some face
Cause I've never been one for acting naïve
And so what we've got nothing to prove
Why on earth would we soften the mood
Do we think that this wire is better left live
I would've known better if I was on the outside
I would've known better if I was on the outside
Looking in looking in
But this chain just eats away at the people who use it
No ones gonna say that it's easier losing
Touch with who we need
When it's lonelier on the outside

Well it's me, going so weak in the knees
Thinking of falling asleep looking in your eyes
But right now, I'm finding it hard to make out
Which word I somehow left out, because of that smile
But baby don't be so elusive, I'm trying so hard to refute this,
And every night I just dream this dream of you
You're wearing that same old black dress,
Hair to the shoulders and no less
And calling out the same name over and over again,
And it's me
(I adore you)
When will she be finding it harder to breathe,
Finding it harder to sleep through the same night
But right now, the days turn into nights
And nothing feels alright, for you
Baby don't be so elusive, I'm trying so hard to refute this
And every night I just dream this dream of you
You're wearing that same old black dress,
Hair to the shoulders and no less
And calling out the same name over and over again,
And it's me
But it's like there's something more,
Pick my heart off the floor,
And it's you that I adore, adore
Baby don't be so elusive, when will you cease to refuse this
And every night I just dream this dream of you.
You're wearing that same old black dress,
Hair to the shoulders and no less
And calling out the same name over and over again,
And it's me

Congratulate my friends
on the birth of a healthy son
take him quietly and hold him in my arms
It will seem so violent
crying on each others' shoulders
always
We're for the other
we're for each other
Divided in the garden
I am waiting for myself
to cool off silently
or to keep it by
it's a gutted one
a side that's split away
I take him quietly and hold him in my arms
When they know you
when they know you
when they know you
when they really really know you
it will seem so obvious
fixing what is never broken
always

I'm gonna die of loneliness, I know
I'm gonna die of loneliness, for sure
I'm gonna die of loneliness, I know
I'm gonna die of loneliness, for sure
My dearest friend, you'll soon begin to love again, to love again.

[Senza is a song with your words, the words you choose, the emotions you choose, the sensations you choose.]

Sittin in that town in New Mexico
Named after a game show
Tryin to decide if I should sell my van
Buy a truck, and drive down to Texas
Sometimes I think I'm gunnin for the big time
Sometimes I think I'm runnin out of time
And that big odometer in the sky turned over
That big odometer in the sky just turned over
Lately I've been scattered
My attention span is like a three-year-old
I pick up my guitar and I set it down
Try reading booksend up going downtown
My friends say relax and slow down
But my insides feel like a ghost town
Tumblin and blowin and all my guts turned over
Like a tumbleweed through an empty town turning over
Turning over, upside down
Blowing round and round and round
Turning over, wrongside up
Can barely fill my coffee cup
And I can't find me one new leaf worth turning over
I can't find me one new leaf worth turning over
Maybe I should go get in a fight
Look for someone's honor to protect
Maybe I'll go down and drink my fill
Maybe I can go sign someone's will
Out there in the alley someone's tryin'
To start their car but that old thing ain't buyin'
Every time he tries he scrapes the air
But that tired crate, she's barely turnin over

She lives with an orange tree
The girl that does yoga
She picks the dead ones from the ground
When we come over
And she gives
I get
Without giving anything to me
Like a morning sun
Like a morning
Like a morning sun
Good good morning sun
The girl that does yoga
When we come over
Girl that does yoga
He lives in a little house
On the side of a little hill
Picks the litter from the ground
Litter little brother spills
He gives
I get
Without giving anything to me
And the dogs they run
And the dogs they
And the dogs they run
In the good good morning sun
Side of a little hill
Litter little brother spills
Side of a little hill
Oh and she's always dressed in white
She's like an angel, man
She burns my eyes
Oh and she turns
She pulls a smile
We drive her round
And she drives us wild
Oh and she moves like a little girl
I become a child, man
She moves my world
And she gets splashed in rain
And turns away
And leaves me standing
She lives with an orange tree
The girl that does yoga
Got a wolf to keep her warm
When he comes over
She gives
He gets
Without giving anything to see
And the day it ends
And the day it
And the day it ends
And there's no need for me
The girls that does yoga
When we come over
The girls that does yoga

Don't you think you'll be better off
Without me tied around your neck, it's like the way your
Body pulls me underneath where I can't breathe
I'm tired of talking, I've been screaming all day
Don't you think we'll be better off
Without temptation to regress, to fake tenderness
Waiting to see someone we won't know for long
In cities we'll only leave
Don't you think we'll be better off
Without the pressure to address
A room of faces
Waiting to hear some strange women speak in tongues
On lonely fridays of my loveless drunk, baby
Loveless drunk, baby
I don't want to belong, I don't want to belong
I don't want to belong, to you, to anyone
I don't want to belong, I don't want to belong
I don't want to belong, to you, to anyone
I don't want to belong, I don't want to belong

The end of the affair
The weight of the world
The kindness gone to bed
The way of your laughter
Alive in the halls
Did he hear, did he hear
The fumbled words you said
Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Hell, I don't know
Do I care, do I care
The thunder's rumbled sound
Now I watch her
Running 'round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends
The end of the affair
The weight of the world
The kindness gone to bed
It's free of your laughter
Alive after all
Did he hear, did he hear
The fumbled words he said
Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Hell, I don't know
Do I care, do I care
The thunder's rumbled sound
Now I watch her
Running 'round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends
Now I watch her
Running 'round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends
This is it
This is just it
Go to him
What the hell, love?
What the hell?
This is it
This is just it
Go to him
What the hell, love?
What the hell?
This is it
What the hell, love?
What the hell?

Don't give me something to hold in my hand
Something else to believe in
'Cause I'm over it
And your reasons for wanting to stay
Your reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are dull to you
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
Well, I could go wild
'Cause you might lock me up
And I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
But god forbid then you might envy me
So don't give me love with an old book of rules
That kind of love's just for fools
And I'm over it
And my reasons for walking away
My reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything are lost with you
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
Well I could go wild
But you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
But god forbid, then you might envy me
I have tried
Into this box
Well I could go wild
But you might lock me up
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
When I could be wild and free
But god forbid, then you might envy me
I could be wild and free
But god forbid, then you might

Coco what do you know?
Do you know that the hills are covered in snow?
Where does it come from and where does it go?
Tell me do you know Coco?
Coco what do you know?
Do you know why the workmen are digging that hole?
Making a mess of every single road,
Tell me do you know Coco?
You don't know where the Whales go in the water,
You don't know why in space there's no such thing as time,
But you know every girl is someone's daughter,
And your daddy must be proud,
Well I'd be proud if you were mine.
Coco what do you know?
Do you know all about the trains of old?
Well they only moved when they burned up coal,
Tell me do you know coco?
You don't know where the Whales go in the water,
You don't know why in space there's no such thing as time,
But you know every girl is someone's daughter,
And your daddy must be proud,
Oh I'd be proud if you were mine.
You don't know where the Whales go in the water,
You don't know why in space there's no such thing as time,
But you know every girl is someone's daughter,
And your daddy must be proud,
Cause I'd be proud if you were mine.
Coco what do you know?
Do you know what happens to your very soul?
Where does it come from and where does it go?
Tell me do you know Coco?

You should have seen her
She was 17 and knew that I (knew it) was too young
But I knew she was (knew it) the one
If I was older
She would my girl and I could be her man
There's no doubt
I know there's no doubt
Because I could be (I could be)
So good to her and give her anything that she wants
Any thing that she wants
But until then (until then)
I keep thinking away to let this girl really know
I gotta let her know
[Chorus]
If I was older, She would be my girl
If I was older, I'd give her the world
If I was older, I'd treat like a queen
If I was older (older)
If I was older, I'd always take her out
If I was older, Always ice her down
If I was older, treat her like a queen
If I was older (older)
She's so pretty (yeah)
If I was only (yeah)
A little bit older (yeah)
I will tell her (yeah)
That I like her (that I liked her)
That I like her (that I liked her)
Cause to me she's (too me she)
She's such a dime peace
My friends think, my friends think
That I'm crazy to fall in love the way I do (I do)
But they don't know what I do (I do)
So until then I'll keep thinking away
To let this girl really know
I gotta let her know
[Chorus]
I gotta let her know
How I feel (how I feel)
I gotta let her know
That love is real (that love is real)
Oh hey boo
If I was older
[Chorus]

She'll ask you where you've been
You'll be hours late when you finally come home
She'll suspect something's wrong
Make sure to erase all your outgoing calls
Why trouble her lonely soul?
She doesn't have to know
Doesn't have to know
Why tell her, it would hurt her so
She's such a lonely soul
Such a lonely soul
She'll be watching you for sure
Afraid to find out what she already knows
And she'll try to stay calm
'Cause you'll be so hard to get to and she's still in love
Why trouble her lonely soul?
She doesn't have to know
Doesn't have to know
Why tell her? It would hurt her so
She's such a lonely soul
Such a lonely soul

If you go away then
Don't you come back round here no more
And if you make the move then
Don't expect to come home to an open door
I'm not the same person I was a year ago
You cut me deeply and the scars still show
You've walked between the raindrops for far too long
You're gonna get what's yours
And if you go away then
Don't you come back round here no more
I'm not the same person I was a year ago
You cut me deeply and the scars still show

Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you
It's the wrong time
For somebody new
It's a small crime
And I've got no excuse
Is that alright?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright?
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Is that alright?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright
Is that alright with you?
Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be cheating on you
It's the wrong time
But she's pulling me through
It's a small crime
And I've got no excuse
Is that alright?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright?
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Is that alright?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright
Is that alright with you?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?
No

Take my eyes, my melody
For I choose not to say
Mix my blood with honey
For the taste so sweet
I felt it moving through my skin
This feeling wrapped around my sin
I'm shedding off my innocence
It plays upon my sanity
This feeling, it's taking over me
One with my head, my soul, my memory
My loving home, my family
As I'm shedding off my innocence
For the lizard I choose to be
To be young my friend is a curse none the less
And a curse I choose to leave
I felt it moving through my skin
This feeling wrapped around my sin
One with my head, my soul, my memory
My loving home, my family
I know they'll come for me
If I need
For I see the love in you
It feeds me
And you, you fell upon my plate
And you make the same mistakes
My head, my soul, my memory
My loving home, my family
They'll come for me
If I need
For I see the love in you
It feeds me

Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said "see lookit, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers"
And I said I know it well
That secret that you knew
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl
'Cause its running you with red
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said "ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this"
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss
And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?
And I said I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well

by morning I'll be gone
the highway will welcome me
to her warmth
let her arms lay down their guides
let her lead me into the sun
I will go softly
I do not disturb
this rhythm
this city
this history
I leave it behind love
will you be here when I return
if I if I
if I see you on the street
will you recognize me
will I recognize you
the features of your body
my body?
your hip-sway walk
my wandering eyes
your beat that injects my arms
old lover
new friend
past life
will you recognize my smell
rolled through passing towns
like sticky sweet hands?
my new words
my new eyes
my ever-changing skin?

Who's afraid of the sun?
Who'd question the goodness of the mighty?
We who banish the threat,
When your little ones all go nighty-nighty.
Well, there's no time for doubt right now
And less time to explain.
So get back on your horses,
Kiss my ring, join our next campaign.
And the empire grows with the news that we're winning.
With more fear to conquer
And more gold thread for spinning.
Bright as the sun, shining on everyone.
Some would say that we forced our words
And we find that ingenuously churlish.
Words are just words.
Don't be so pessimistic, weak and girlish.
We like strong, happy people
Who don't think there's something wrong with pride,
Work makes them free
And we spread that freedom far and wide.
And the empire grows,
The seeds of its glory,
For every five tanks,
Plant a sentimental story,
Till they worship the sun,
Even Christ-loving ones.
And we'll kill the terror who rises
And a million of their races.
But when our people torture you
That's a few random cases.
Don't question the sun
It doesn't help anyone.
But the journalist cried out
When it was too late to stop us.
Everyone had awakened
To the dream they could enter our colossus.
And now I'm right,
Here you said I'm right,
There's nothing that can harm me.
Cause the sun never sets
On my dungeons or my army.
And the empire fell
On it's own splintered axis.
And the emperor wanes
As the silver moon waxes.
And the farmers will find our coins
In their strawberry fields
While somebody somewhere
Twists his ring as someone kneels.
Oh where is the sun, shining for everyone.
Oh where is the sun, shining for everyone.

Where did I go?
Where did I go?
What is this sorrow?
What is this sorrow?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?
What is this sorrow?
What is this sorrow?
Where did I go?
What am I doing?
What time is it?
Have I always been filled with questions?
Where's the show tonight?
And who's on?
Did i see them play in Houston?
What year was that?
What day is it?
Why do I lean on good intentions?
What are intentions?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?
What is this sorrow?
What is this sorrow?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?
What is this sorrow?
What is this sorrow?
What's left to burn?
What's worth burning?
What's flammable?
What happens when all flags burn together?
Is that unity?
Is that unity?
Is it meaningful to be angry?
Who's angry?
Are you angry?
Why do I get the feeling you might be angry?
What is anger?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?
What is this sorrow?
What is this sorrow?
Where did I go?
Where did I go?
What is this sorrow?
Is this sorrow?

Oliver Paul, twenty years old
Thick head of hair worries he's going bald
Wakes up at a quarter past nine
Fare evades his way down the 96 tram line
Breakfast on the run again
He's well aware he's dropping soy
Linseed Vegemite crumbs everywhere
Feeling sick at the sight of his computer
He dodges his way through the Swanston commuters
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man
Sleeping in the corner of a Metro bus stand
He screams "I'm not going to work today!
Gonna count the minutes that the trains run late
Sit on the grass building pyramids out of Coke cans"
Headphone wielding to the Nicholas Building
He trips on a pothole that's not been filled in
He waits for an elevator, 1 to 9
A lady walks in and waits by his side
Her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin
Hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton
Vickers perfume on her breath
A tortoise-shell necklace between her breasts
She looks him up and down with a Botox frown
He's well used to that look by now
The elevator dings, and they awkwardly step in
Their fingers touch on the rooftop button...
"Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you
You're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you!"
He said, "I think you're projecting
The way that you're feeling
I'm not suicidal just idling insignificantly
I come up here, for perception and clarity
I like to imagine I'm playing Sim City
All the people look like ants from up here
And the wind's the only traffic you can hear"
He said, "All I ever wanted to be was an
Elevator Operator can you help me please?!"
"Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you
You're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you!"

I wanna be quick, move at light speed
Never grow up, never come down
I wanna be small, walk with small feet
Treading the space just above ground
Quick as I can, quick as a cat
Quicker than sand, quicker than that
I wanna be young, wanna be beautiful
Making a small beautiful sound
Albert Einstein was never good at Math
But he found time down a curving path
The faster you go, the slower you grow
The less that you have to fall
The faster you go, the slower you grow
Until you weigh nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing at all
I wanna have girth, I wanna have mass
It's the new weight-loss plan
I wanna run free, wanna run fast
Go on and catch me if you can
Quick as a shark, quick as a blink
Quick as a thought, quicker than you think
I wanna be scarce, out of sight
I am light's biggest fan
Albert Einstein was never good at Math
But he found time down a curving path
The faster you go, the slower you grow
The less that you have to fall
The faster you go, the slower you grow
Until you weigh nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing at all
Richard Petty, Richard Petty, Richard Petty
Ain't got nothing on me
I wanna be quick, move at light speed
Never grow up, never come down
I wanna be small, walk with small feet
Treading the space just above ground
Quick as I can, quick as a cat
Quicker than sand, quicker than that
I wanna be young, wanna be beautiful
Making a small beautiful sound
Albert Einstein was never good at Math
But he found time down a curving path
The faster you go, the slower you grow
The less that you have to fall
The faster you go, the slower you grow
Until you weigh nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing at all

(for lynda petranek)
climbing to the top of mountains
reaching for the sky it disappears
watch my hands lose their grip
watch my life lose its meaning
(what's my life it's losing meaning)
I wish I could climb
to the top with you
I'd pick you up and cradle the fall
I wish I had the hand to heal you
only my hand is so small
struggle for the point of gravity
search for that slice of light
your breath beats through me
I keep struggling
breath bearts through you
keep struggling
breath beats
things just got rolling here
you started dying
it might be heaven there
what if they're lying
if I could climb to the top with you
if I had the strength I'd heal you
(if I)
she needs with anger heart
and cancer breast
a lap to rest
she needs a lap to rest

There was no doubt
The moment was savored
With or without
Your dad's coda speaking out of anger
When word got out
The kid was in danger
Then we all went south
For skirting the chains of labor
For the kindness of strangers
So we all got out
For the kindness of strangers
And we just walked out
The kid was leaning on a leg to favor
But there was no doubt
The kid was in danger
'Cause she was cast out
But turned a corner and her dad forgave her
For the kindness of strangers

Her heart throb heart throbs 340 beats a minute.
Those slit throat confessions licked by randy flames of persuasion,
The shaving of bone, the lingering taste of singed enamel.
The negatives, Jennifer.
Such uncompromising positions
I said, "You don't need a doctor honey, you need a mortician baby.
Because I don't want your money,
I don't want your favors.
This ain't no blackmail
This is for amusement.
Don't shady pasts make interesting broadcasts?
And human error is never an acceptable answer, Jennifer.

I wish I had a mango tree
In my backyard
With you standin' next to me
Take the picture
From her lips I heard her say
Can I have you
Caught up on what to say
I said you do
I said you do
I said you do
Through my eyes I can see
A shooting star
Weavin' its way across the sea
Somewhere from mars
Down the street we would run
To scratch our names in the path
Young and free in the sun
Wheels upon the tar
I said you do
I said you do
I said you do
I said you do

Crows ravaging a field of wheat
Stars jealous of the moon
Scarecrows know their own defeat
Envy and the heart that it consumes
Today I walked without you
Like an empty bottle drifting out to sea
I would change it I knew how to
But it don't come that easily
[Chorus]
If my heart wasn't such a jungle
Maybe you wouldn't feel so alone
If your her heart wasn't such and ocean
I wouldn't sink like a stone
If you weren't so far from me
I could hold you while you're sleeping
And hear you breathing softly
And be there when you're waking
Phone calls could not complete us
Letters cannot replace
Miles and miles and miles between us
Another time another place
I have yet to meet another
Who burns bright as you
I'm not looking for any other
I only want you
[Chorus]

This one's for you
This one's for me
This one's for you
What must I be?
I've got a nervous feeling, over you
I got someone to love me, oh so true
But who am I fooling, I like airline food
I need to feel hope, I need to feel young again
I need to be bold, start using my tongue again
They can laugh as I cry, They can cut 'til I bleed
I ain't losing, 'cause this one's for me
This one's for you
This one's for me
This one's for you
Tell me what the fuck must I be for you
Tell me what must I be for you?
I've got a nervous feeling over you
I've got someone to love me, oh so true
I've got someone who loves me, oh so true
But I need to feel hope, I need to feel young again
And I need to be bold, start using my tongue again
They can laugh as I cry, they can cut 'til I bleed
I ain't losing, 'cause this one's for me

Like an ancient day and I'm on trial
Let them seize the way, this once was an island
And I could not stay for I believed them
Left for the lights always in season
Impassable night in a crowd of homesick
Fully grown children, you'll leave the lights
Your family may not wait, Sir, keep on breathing
Our parents rue the day, they find us kneeling
Let them think what they may, for they've good reason
Left for the lights always in season

In all you'll see
What was it that came down on me that night
A conjuring, I held on to that moment
And lie just to make it alive
I stood out there in the covering
In the baskings of a holy night
And I was lucid and conscious
And hovering like a firefly
My mind stretched out on the canopy
It put its arms out slow
And I heard the whispers of silence floating down from the radio
So come on, come on I'm ready now
I got the feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in bed of my soul
I saw the light from a kettle gun
Sixteen days under a Southern Sun
And there were times when I thought that
I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there
You wouldn't believe me if I told you so
The things I saw were enough to make the man in me
A man in me, make a man of me
So come on, come on I'm ready now
Go get your things out honey, let's get ready to roll
Oh I can feel the wave coming over me
I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go
As a child I was wonder-eyed at the thought that I might know
A life in the ecstasy of Rock'n Roll
O-oh-oh i'm not taking it slow
I'm an arrow in a bow
You think that I don't know, what it is that makes me glow
So come on, come on I'm ready now
I got the feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul

I got me a shovel
And I'm digging a ditch
And I'm going to fight for this four square feet of land like a mean old son of a bitch
I got me a future
I'm not stuck on the past
I got no new tricks, yeah I'm up on bricks but me
I'm a machine and I was built to last
I'm trying to get better because I haven't been my best
She took a plain black marker, started writing on my chest
She drew a line across the middle of my broken heart
And said, come on now, let's fix this mess
We could get better
Because we're not dead yet
They threw me a whirlwind
And I spat back the sea
I took a battering but I've got thicker skin and the best people
I know looking out for me
So I'm taking the high road
My engines running high and fine
May I always see the road rising up to meet me
And my enemies defeated in the mirror behind
I'm trying to get better because I haven't been my best
She took a plain black marker, started writing on my chest
She drew a line across the middle of my broken heart,
And said: "Come on now, let's fix this mess"
We could get better
Because we're not dead yet
It's just a knot in the small of your back
You could work it out with your fingers
It's just a tune that got stuck in your head
You could work it out with your fingers
It's just some numbers tangled up in your sums
You could work it out with your fingers
It's just a simple braille mission from the person you miss
A reminder you could always be
A little bit better than this
So try and get better and don't ever accept less
Take a plain black marker and write this on your chest
Draw a line underneath all of this unhappiness
Come on now, let's fix this mess
We could get better
Because we're not dead yet
We could get better
Because we're not dead yet

Place outside where I pass to waste my time
In the shadows of the dark you'll find
Behind sleepless eyes there's a woman
Taste of my sweet
Love like defeat can be so cruel
It can fill you full for a while
You're a lamb with fangs
Girl dressed like crimson flames
So they see it
You're like a bad burn
But they never let you try
Just to feel it
Taste of my sweet
Love like defeat can be so cruel
It can fill you full of wild dreams
And the back of your knees
Can you bend them for me please
I could meet you for a while
Dressed so plain
I put my head in a frame
And the paints just words I scream
Wrapped up in a pretty string
I leave a prize at the heels of your feet
Taste of my sweet
Love like defeat can be so cruel
It can fill you full of wild dreams
And the back of your knees darling
Can you bend them for me please
I could meet you for a while

Maybe in the start we would laugh
Maybe in the end we would cry
But I believe in every book I've ever read
And what you said
And the moon was in the sky
And the tears did fill my eyes
And the memories they all had passed
But in my head they'll always last
And in the end before I could be
I'd shown the world
What it means to me
Believe it or not, I made them see
This is what happiness means to me
Will I ever see your face again
Will I ever touch your skin
I'll never stop loving everything you do
But not me and you
And the moon was in the sky
And the tears did fill my eyes
And the memories they all had passed
But in my head they'll always last
And in the end before I could be
I'd shown the world
What it means to me
Believe it or not, I made them see
This is what happiness means to me

And I, I called through the air that night
A calm sea voiced with a lie
I could only smile, I've been alone some time
And all, and all, it's been fine
And you, you had hope for me now
I danced all around it somehow
Be fair to me, I may drift a while
Were it up to me, you know I'd
I, I called through the air that night
The faults were swarming inside
Was it infantile, that which we desired?
Were it up to me, all from your eyes
And I, I called through the air that night
My thoughts were still blurry inside
We were closer then, I've been alone some time
Filled you glass with gin
Filled your heart with pride
And you, you had hope for me now
I danced all around it somehow
Be fair to me, I may drift a while

The summer ends and we wonder where we are
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car
And you both look so young
And last night was hard, you said
You packed up every room
And then you cried and went to bed
But today you closed the door and said
"We have to get a move on.
It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead,
We push ourselves ahead."
And it was cloudy in the morning
And it rained as you drove away
And the same things looked different
It's the end of the summer
It's the end of the summer,
When you move to another place
And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same
She walked alone all spring,
She had a boyfriend when the summer came
And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm
They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn
And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving
So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves
She held on to his sleeves
And she doesn't want to let go
'Cause she won't know what she's up against
The classrooms and the smart girls
It's the end of the summer
It's the end of the summer
When you hang your flowers up to dry
And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head
It felt like the first day of school
But I was going to the moon instead
And I walked down the hall
With the notebooks they got for me
My dad led me through the house
My mom drank instant coffee
And I knew that I would crash
But I didn't want to tell them
There are just some moments when your family makes sense
They just make sense
So I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on
We walked out on the dark and frozen grass
The end of the summer
It's the end of the summer
When you send your children to the moon
The summer ends and we wonder who we are
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car
And today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree
I passed the farms that made it
Through the last days of the century
And I knew that I was going to learn again
Again, in this less hazy light
I saw the fields beyond the fields
The fields beyond the fields
And the colors are much brighter now
It's like they really want to tell the truth
We give our testimony to the end of the summer
It's the end of the summer,
You can spin the light to gold.

Tell me something
Do you love him
Does he love you too
Like I love you
I know nature is beside me
When he's inside you
I feel it too
Here's a picture of my mother
There's no one like she
And finally
I do
Goddamn
I do goddamn see

To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being
There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me

The world's yours when you turn eighteen,
And you feel like you could have anything
Which way will you go?
Which way will you go?
And what you call love is a daydream
All the stars around you are setting,
Which way will they go?
Which way will you go?
'cause it's a great big world and you know it,
Yeah it's a great big world and you know it,
It's a great big world and you're rolling down,
The truth hurts when you turn eighteen,
But the truth gets even less easy,
But what do ya know?
Yeah what do ya know?
Pick a side, decide what you will be,
Will your dreams turn to reality,
Which way will they go?
Which way will you go?
'cause it's a great big world and you know it,
Yeah it's a great big world and you know it,
It's a great big world and you're rolling down,
Our day has come around,
We're out of this town,
Out of this town,
Our day has come around,
We're out of this town,
Out of this town for now
'cause it's a great big world and you know it,
Yeah it's a great big world and you know it,
It's a great big world and you're rolling down,
Rolling down,
Rolling down,
Rolling down

It's good that you're home
It's good to spend a night without him checking my phone for you, baby
We talk about life as she caught me up on drinks in no time
And oh, before you know we'll be falling in drunk and I'll be letting you know
That when you wrap me around your fingers, baby
And you make me do that shit I never do
And you pick me up on Sauchiehall street
I know I want you to myself again
The bar that you loved
Lock us in and let us keep on singing out lungs on the barstools
On the walk back to yours you made me fall in love with Glasgow
And oh, before you know I'll be carrying you over the threshold
'Cause when you wrap me around your fingers, baby
And you make me do that shit I never do
And you prop me up on Sauchiehall street
I know I want you to myself again
And oh, before you know we'll be falling in drunk and I'll be letting you know
When you wrap me around your fingers, baby
And you make me do that shit that I've never done
And as I piss you off on Sauchiehall street
I know I want you to myself again

The sun burns down
Leaving God's bright stamp
On Peach Branch Horse and Bible Camp
Where we're splashing in the water
Joined in song
Swimming with the Spirit the whole day long
I'm a teen for God
God is watching, teen for God
God is watching, teen for God
The girls have looks and the girls have rules
They came here from their Bible schools
They can make you pay attention
To the way you dress and eat
Make you trip over your own two feet and they
Kneel down on their towels at night
Their nightgowns glow with a Holy light
And we pray for the sinners
And their drunken car wrecks
And vow that I'll never get high
And have sex
I'm a teen for God
God is watching, teen for God
God is watching, teen for God
And God made every leaf on every tree
Each grain of sand
God has a plan
For what we're meant to be
I gotta wait for God
Dear Lord
I plan each day
The things I will not do or say
But I'm driven by a passion
Is it only there to tame?
It fills my heart and it calls my name and
This world that you made for us
I know, I know, is dangerous
So I ride a lot of horses
And I never even swear
Sorta like praying I'm just not there
Oh God
God is watching, oh God
God is watching
But God made love
God made the rivers run
And cowboy boots and bathing suits
And the boy's skin dries in the sun
You gotta help me, God
Help me know, four years from now
I won't believe in you anyhow
And I'll mope around the campus
And I'll feel betrayed
All those guilty summers I stayed
But then I'll laugh
That I fell for the lure
Of the pain of desire to feel so pure
And I'll bear all the burdens
Of my little daily crimes
Wish I had a God for such cynical times
Far from today
But for now I'm a sacred vessel
Rip me open, I spread your word
Like a milkweed pod
I'm a radio station,
Your Holy transmission
Even more, like a lightning rod
I'm a lightning rod, a teen for God
God is watching, teen for God
God is watching... a teen for God

It's never been enough
To live an breathe just like the rest of us
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up now
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up now
Whoa look into my eyes
Whoa don't you throw the fight
If you stay with me tonight it will be alright
If you stay with me tonight it will be alright
It's never been your thing
To open up your lungs and sing along
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up now
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up
Gotta make your mind up now
Whoa look into my eyes
Whoa don't you throw the fight
If you stay with me tonight it will be alright
If you stay with me tonight it will be alright
You've been banging your head against a brick wall
Trying to let the light in trying to make the rain fall
You've been banging your head against a wall
You've been banging your head against a brick wall
Trying to let the light in trying to make the rain fall
You've been banging your head against a wall
You've been banging your head against a brick wall
Trying to make the rain fall
You've been banging your head against a wall Ho
Whoa look into my eyes
Whoa don't you throw the fight
If you stay with me tonight it will be alright
If you stay with me tonight it will be alright

Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small, and grow in time
And we always seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf
Too many books
Read me your favorite line
Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
He came back the other day, you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same
Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times
She broke down the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
But some things they stay the same
Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Time, there's always time
On my mind
Pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time

So wake me in the morning or I'll sleep all day
And I need to feel the sunlight, on my face
If I live this any longer, I'm gonna fade to gray
It's time to say goodbye Elizabeth, it's time for me to change
And know my lonely, heart stop beating
And know my lonely eyes don't deceive me
And oh you can't know how I'm feeling
Oh you can't know how I'm feeling
Someone show me another way to go
Someone show me another way
So hold on to something cause I'm spinning out of control
And I don't wanna be alone
So wake me in the morning or I'll sleep all day
And I need to feel something, no time to waste
If I live this any longer, I'm gonna fade away
It's time to say goodbye Elizabeth, it's time for me to change
And know my lonely, heart stop beating
And know my lonely eyes don't deceive me
And oh you can't know how I'm feeling
Oh you can't know how I'm feeling
Someone show me another way to go
Someone show me another way
So hold on to something cause I'm spinning out of control
And I don't wanna be alone
So call if you wanna go, don't make it easy
Call if you wanna go, don't make it easy
And know my lonely, heart stop beating
And know my lonely eyes don't deceive me
And oh you can't know how I'm feeling
Oh you can't know how I'm feeling
And know my lonely, heart stop beating
And know my lonely eyes don't deceive me
And oh you can't know how I'm feeling
Oh you can't know how I'm feeling

So long my misery
I don't need you, you've only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries
Daylight lives like a burden for me
So I escape the sins strewn about the streets
Beyond the ruins of my ancestry
Five pairs of pages of my disbelief
I rose from my moat like a ghost from a grave
Sunken in the salty eyes of the wandering into space
I was heading though the mists across the Golden Gate
All of my rebellions fall in to the falling fate
So long my misery
I don't need you, you have only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries
Springtime came again and it caressed and fell
I flew past the numb lib nuns who never tell
The secrets of the sailors and their seven years spell
I will not fall, nor will my wings ever melt
If I could, I would wash all these wounds away
I would surround your room with a sinner mans grace
I would paint your portrait over everything mundane
More colorful than Easter Sunday
So long my misery
I don't need you, you have only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries
Put me on a boat and lead my inhibitions at bay
My mind is spinning but I haven't much to say
I was running through the canyons
The echoes of your name
You were laughing at me like the sun laughs at the flames
Put me on a page in a book of beginnings
Let me scroll through old volumes of age and teachings
Let me revel all of these forgotten feelings
Lay me with the wretches in the arms of my queen
So long sweet misery
I don't need you, you've only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries
So long sweet misery
I don't need you, you've only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries
No, I haven't slept in centuries
I haven't slept in centuries

I'm sorry that I left you
With your questions all alone
But I was too happy driving
And too angry to drive home
I was thinking about the easy courage
Of my distant friends
They said I could let this bridge wash out
And never make amends
Can I blow this small town
Make a big sound
Like the star of a film noir postcard
Can I just forget the frames I shared with you
And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can change my mind
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime
Well there are Spring Street storefront daisies
Floating on their neon stems
There are new shirts on the clothes racks
Should I feel like one of them
I can find a small apartment
Where a struggling artist died
And pretend because I pay the rent
I know that pain inside
Yeah, let's watch the tour bus stop and tell us
Here's the scene of a spring green life dream
Take the best part
Write it in your caffeine diary
And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can leave tonight
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime
This year April had a blizzard
Just to show she did not care
And the new dead leaves
They made the trees look like children with gray hair
But I'll push myself up through the dirt
And shake my petals free
I'm resolved to being born
And so resigned to bravery
Yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this
Too much rain on a prairie flood plain
Houses floating, love is like that
We built on the river
And that's to say, yeah I'm leaving
But I don't have to go there
I don't have to go to Spring Street
'Cause it's spring everywhere...

There was a time when I enjoyed Vidalia
There was no other fruit I dared my lips to touch
But my granddad he prescribed me Vidalia
For whatever ails you, heart disease, the grippe and such
But to yourself this medicine youll properly expose
The benefits of health, wealth and respect
Oh, eat it like an apple of a deep colored rose
Sweet victory will be yours to dialect
But how my palate grew tired
So sweet, so sweet, so sweet
No thanks, Ill take defeat
I remember a dark and smoky den
Cheeks of roast beef, bloody and rare
Whiskey etched faces of barrel chested men
And Im feeling small, weak and scared

wait for time to turn or you calling my name again
same talk with the same loose friends about calling you
staying young in my mind, in the windows that reflect the sun
left on a moving perch, singing out loud
and now you're far away, and nothing will ease the pain
now trouble is on my parade
cold on the bone, from a borrowed dress
and sunday morning's once more, once less
my words on a page, and they're ruined in ink
see now you're far away, and nothing will ease the pain
now trouble is on my parade

It's a beautiful night for me to be here
With my empty head
I should have stayed at home
And watched the weather
It's a wonderful night buts it's a shame
Because there is an empty bed
I should have stayed at home
'Til I got better
And nothing's changing
The record's scraping round and round and round
And nothing's changing
The people drive their cars to town
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman by Monday
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman, yeah
It's a beautiful night for me to be here
Now our love is dead
I should have stayed at home
And watched the weather
Well it's a wonderful night
But this is it now
I've left your head
I should have stayed at home
'Til I got better
And nothing's changing
The record's scraping round and round and round
And nothing's changing
The people drive their cars to town
The people drive their cars
These people drive me
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman by Monday
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman, yeah
Nothing's changing
The record's scraping round and round and round
Nothing's changing
The people drive their cars
These people drive me
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman by Monday
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman by Monday
I ask the weatherman to sent a cloud my way
I ask the weatherman by Monday
The weatherman

Your name is a triangle
Your heart is a square
I love to see you
Way over there
Once I was happy
I found it intriguing
Then you got to me
Left me bleeding
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
I thought we could eat bread
I thought we could talk
On darker days
With our boots kicked off
You looked to me
And I looked away
Though I had been looking
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you

I pack my suit in a bag, I'm all dressed up for Prague
I'm all dressed up with you, all dressed up for him too
Prepare myself for a war, before I even open up my door
Before I even look out, I'm pissing all of my bullets about
Wrap myself in a bag, I'm all wrapped up in Prague
I'm all wrapped up in you, I'm all wrapped up in him too
Prepare myself for a war and I don't know what I'm doing this for
Trying to let it all go but how can I when you still don't know?
I could wait for you like that hole in your boot
Waiting to be fixed, I could wait for you
What good would that do but to leave me bruised?
Cheers darlin', here's to you and your lover, darling I got years
Pack my suit in a bag, pack myself in a bag
Pack my suit in a bag, all dressed up for Prague
Pack my suit in a bag, all dressed up for
All dressed up for, all dressed up for

Under what spell the guiding light
Betook the undertaker
Under whose gaze did fall such evil blunder
Characters of flamen eyes
Eager to burn the wooden castle
Eager to wet the paper heart of children birds
The aching starlet
The singing sinew
The whining ghost
Brutal wind of snowy harlot
Chafen mine eyes
A sandpaper kiss
Bloody rosen my cheek
Purple kiss of stardust
Pink balloon of time
Candied on the inside
Baby pit bull butterfly
Do da do da do dah do dah

Over the hill
I will be waiting on for you
I won't pretend
That you don't mean nothing to me
Come now, come now
Come back now, come back now
The doubt will creep
And crawl in on you
The dark can leap
And fall upon you
Come back now, come back now
Let it be, let it go
Let it fall, let it blow
Let it come, let it go
Let it fall, we will know

We've been riding all night and the skies that diminish are right to be known
We've been finding insight in what we knew to be right from the day we were born
Every day is the last, only further in time from the will of the past
So we circle and strive and reverse when we drive so we'll never arrive
We were silent before, but we're not anymore, now we'll even the score
We'll describe and dissect every secret effect that lay hid behind doors
There was time in the past to describe or outlast all that cluttered and cast
A dispirting light through our shallowing nights soon will never be right

I pack my suit in a bag
I'm all dressed up for Prague
I'm all dressed up with you
All dressed up for him too

Wrap myself in a bag

I'm all wrapped up in you
I'm all wrapped up in him too
Prepare myself for a war

But how can I when you still don't know?
I could wait for you
Like that hole in your boot
Waiting to be fixed
I could wait for you
What good would that do
But to leave me pricked?
Cheers, darlin'
Here's to you and your lover

Ron and Nancy got the house but Sid and Nancy rule
I died eight years ago; I'm still a legend at my high school
I stole a Chevy and I wrapped it round a tree
But that's OK 'cause no one's gonna make the next century
I'm up in heaven now they say I'm here to stay
Where the clouds are really puffy and the angels sing every day
Alleluia
The cafeteria's got everything, it's gonna drive me mad
Cause it looks just like a big Hawaiian party that my mother had
It's like the worst Elvis film I've ever seen
Technicolor luau all on technicolor green
There's camping trips and donkey rides and singing round the fire
And they signed me up for surfing
But they can't get me in the choir
Alleluia
But there she was this morning getting fitted for her wings
Leather boots, magenta hair, and saying nasty things
I'd say she was an angel but it's stupid and it's obvious
I said you'll hate it here 'cause we're the only ones like us
It's crypto-fascist mania, it's silicon deliria
Yeah, she said, you're right, but I like the cafeteria
Alleluia
Hey God, we're the bad kids, we're so nasty, mean and vile
God looks like a guidance counselor, God's got that smile
God says, how could this be, that's really odd
I guess I'll have to check my records, silly me, you know, I'm only God
Alleluia

I know that it was the night
The war broke out because
You and I were driving around
You were doing a story
About if people understood
What had happened to their world
Tonight in bed sleeping
A world in bed tonight asleep
You said that you were in touch
With the draft resistors
In case the big boys called you up
You're gonna have to let 'em
Dick you around
But don't let 'em make you do
What you can't live with
Tonight in bed with me sleeping
You looked like you were just a little kid
Shane, I said, you've got to wat
You've gotta have fear in your heart (x 3)
I can hear a friend once saying to me
You've got a thing about men
You're gonna like when they throw you around
But don't let 'em make a fool out of you
Tonight in bed with you sleeping
The world in bed tonight asleep

I know a girl laying down
She's sleeping weeks at a time
And when she wakes up she watches TV
Counting cracks in the ceiling
No, I don't know what she's thinking
So I give up waiting for someone, waiting
Talking to someone, staring
I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind
Girl's laying down
Never come around
So much for girl staying
In afraid of being needed
And seen she watches
The world on a screen
She's distant
And God knows I tried to leave her
'Cause she's got a constant fever
I let it slip my mind
I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind
I know a girl laying down
No, I never wasted my time
We have something in common
She's as different as I am

Instrumental
" "Bratislava" is a celebratory march for the Slovakian capital-- a sweaty, saw-dusted cabaret jam with Gogol Bordello. It's at moments like these, his vocals placed further back in the mix, that you realize the kid sounds truly authentic and captivating."
- Pitchfork, Brandon Stosuy, May 12, 2006

Last night I dreamed that they dropped a bomb
And the seas ran dry and the winds has calmed
The skyscrapers fell and they all turned to dust
Their skeletons of steel were covered in rust
And everything I loved and feared
Had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared
Had all at once disappeared
The colours were drained straight from the sky
And nothing living had survived
The mountains were merely removed from the earth
All silver and gold had lost it's worth
And everything I loved and feared
Had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared
Had all at once disappeared
I woke from the dream in a cold, cold sweat
I was full of doubt and deep regret
For suddenly it was all so clear to me
There was nothing left in which to believe
And everything i loved and feared
Had all at once disappeared
Oh everything i loved and feared
Had all at once disappeared

I'm not a leader
I'm not a left-wing,rehtoric,
mobilizing force of one
But but there was a time way back
many years ago in college
Don't laugh
but I thought I was a radical
I ran a hemp liberation league with my boyfriend
It was true love with a common cause
and besides that he was a sagittarius
We used to say that our love was like hemp rope
three times as strong as the rope that you buy domesticly
we would bond in the face of oppression from big business
and the Deans
But I knew there was a problem
every time the group would meet
everyone would light up
It made it difficult to discuss glaucoma and human rights,
not to mention chemotherapy
Well, sometimes life gives us lessons
sent in ridiculous packaging
So I found him in the arms of a "student
against the treacherous use of fur"
And he gave no apology
He just turned to me stoned out to the edge of oblivion
He didn't pull up the sheets and I think he even smiled
as the said to me: (spoken)
-Well, I guess our dreams went up in smoke.....Huhuh
-and I said:
-No, our dreams went up in dreams....you stupid pot-head
And another thing
What kind of a name is "students
against the treacherous use of fur"
Fur is already dead and besides
a name like that doesn't make a good acronym
I am older now
I know the rise and gradual fall of a daily victory
And I still write to my Senators saying they should
legalize cannabis and I should know
'Cause I am a horticulturist
I have a husband and two children out in Lexington, Mass.
And my ex-boyfriend can't tell me I've sold out
Because he's in a cult
and he's not allowed to talk to me.....

Miss madonna won't you give me a kiss
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
Miss madonna won't you give me a kiss
One of your soft sweet lagrimas
Oh miss madonna won't you please give me a kiss
Give me one of those soft sweet lagrimas
'Cause i felt your pain
When your baby was slain
And i tossed some roses to perfume his grave
Oh miss madonna won't you let me underneath your halo
'Cause it's raining hard
Raining hard in this abyss
Miss madonna...
Oh miss madonna where you goin' after church
In that preacher's car
You know o won't tell nobody
That you've been smoking cigars
I won't tell nobody
Tell nobody
That you've been smoking cigars
Miss madonna...

You were kind and welcoming
On the slopes of La Bartolina
You can take all of your love out on me
Sophie
You always loved Charlie best
You never knew how each night I wept
But I'll feast upon the crumbs he's left
Sophie
And I can't forgive myself
Oh, I can't forgive myself
You would hide yourself in a shrug
As your hair starting falling out
When you took off your dressing gown
Sophie
Your mother was dressed in black
With a lock of your hair in her hands
And I knew there was no turning back
Sophie
And I can't forgive myself
No, I can't forgive myself
I can't forgive myself
No, I can't forgive myself
Sophie
Sophie
Didn't know when I started running
I was running for my life
Didn't know when I started running
I'd be running my whole life
Didn't know when I started running
I was running for my life
Didn't know when I started running
I'd be running my whole life
I didn't know when I started running
I was running for my life
I didn't know when I started running
I'd be running my whole life

Hose down the dead
Before they die
Before they die
Hose down the dead
Before they die
Before they die
Oh do you hear
A dying fire
A dying fire
Oh can you feel
A golden soul
One golden soul
Now I put the ovaries in my mouth
And all the dogs won't die
And the devil will call the cats home
And he looks up to the sky
I put the ovaries in my mouth
And all the dogs won't die
And the devil will call the cats home
And he looks up to the sky
Hose down the dead
Before they die
Before they die
Hose down the dead
Before they die
Before they die
Before they die
Before they die
Before they die

There's a fire
on Junk Island where
they send their garbage
is anybody listening?
After work we'll watch
the seagulls diving in
and out of the lashing towers of flame.
It twinkles like a pile
of rotting jewels left
to bake in the sun.
Is anybody listening?
We're just like those condom wrappers: used up torn up
thrown away.
And we're just like yesterday's headlines:
drifting, floating, towards the blaze.
If we rob the
liquor store we could
be in Tijuana by the crack of dawn.
If we rob the
mayor's mansion
we could pawn his pawn his modern art and make a fortune.
If we rob the lonely widow
we could steal her credit cards
and buy a cottage by the ocean.
If we swim to Junk Island we'll burn up like the seagulls
and the whiskey bottles.
We're scrapped valentines.
We're tangerine rinds.
We're crimes, crimes, crimes, crimes, crimes. [x4]
And the children
in the subway
eating apple cores.
Is anybody listening?
They're breathing paint out of plastic bags.
Their mumbled mouths say:
"Is anybody listening?"

Sold my cold knot
A heavy stone
Sold my red horse for a venture home
To vanish on the bow
Settling slow
Fit it all, fit it in the doldrums
(Or so the story goes)
Color the era
Film it's historical
My mile could not
Pump the plumb
In my arbor 'till my ardor
Trumped every inner inertia
Lump sum
All at once
Rushing from the sub-pump
(Or so the story goes)
Balance we won't know
We will see when it gets warm

I won't be what you want me to be, baby
I won't say what you want me to say
I'll be right here when you call my name, waiting
And when you tell me you don't want me here
And you, you keep my number 'til the rent check's clear
And my, my body starts burnin' up
And well, I don't want you anymore
So take the money and run to your man, I quit givin' a fuck
And well, I don't trust you anymore
So take the last train home in the dark
And quit breakin' my heart
Well, I won't be what you want me to be, baby
And I won't say what you want me to say
I think about you every night and day lately
And when you tell me you don't want me near
And I, I took to punchin' out your bathroom mirror again
It felt like losin' a friend
And well, I don't want you anymore
So take the money and run to your man, I quit givin' a fuck
And well, I don't trust you anymore
So take the last train home in the dark and quit breakin' my heart

By the way your lips met on mine
You'd been around.
So delicate.. from the moment I saw you
I had to get through
And you were the one.
Take me.. I won't surrender..
A battle for eightteen over me.
Memories.. promises to never die..
Just roll your eyes.
Missin' you, I'm still playin' all these songs
To get along.
And you were the one..
You were the one.
Take me.. I won't surrender..
A battle for eightteen over me.
Can you ever forgive me?
I'm such a fool..
Can you ever forgive me?
I need you.. I need you!
Take me.. I won't surrender..
A battle for eightteen over me.
A battle for eightteen over me..
Over me..
Over me..

Monday
Count all the teeth in my head
Tuesday
Anointed by a man in a dress
It's more than just a question of time
It's more a question of
Reason and rhyme
Wednesday
Got hitched just like a good boy should
Thursday
And Friday didn't feel so good
On Saturday I said my goodbyes
On Sunday I'm food
For the worms and the flies
Pack up your troubles now take
All you can carry
On your way
Your way
Just remember this time you know you've only got seven days
It's more than just a question of time
It's more a question of
Reason and rhyme

In the land of plenty
Enough means more the earth
In a speechless business
With the word above
Big blind blue lines
Brought my fist to the spine
To weed out the meekness
From a worn out mind
I just wanted you to sit right
Should've broken every bone for the first time
I'm not afraid of no rock n rollers
Son take my hand, who's the better man?
Kelly
Kelly
Kelly
Should've towed my line
Should've told my lie
Should've worn my mind
Cut it just like mine

I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
If the sun decides to rise,
without it's colors in your eyes,
it matters not.
A heart of mine,
prefers the darkness.
A Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop.
A Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop.
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!
I got a Hopscotch, teardrop, ready to drop!

I met God
On the edge of town
Where the wind meets the stillness
Where the darkness meets the light
Where the ocean meets the sky
Where the desert meets the rain
Where the earth meets the heavens
On the edge of town
I met God
I asked God
Do one thing for me
Send me back in time
Send me to Seattle
Let me go
Find Kurt Cobain
Take away his gun
Take away his bullets
Talk to him
Make him want to live
Tell him how we love him
Help him see his glory
God said no
If I sent you back
If you really found him
You would only ask him
If he could
Help you get a deal
If he knows a lawyer
If he can help you
God said no
I asked God
Do one thing for me
Send me back in time
Send me to Berlin
Let me find
The one they call Hitler
I will stalk him
I will bring him down
I will bring along
A powerful gun
Loaded with bullets
Obliterate his memory
God said no
If I sent you back
You would get caught up
In theory and discussion
You would let your fears
Delay and distract you
You would make friends
You would take a lover
God said no
I asked God
Do one thing for me
Send me back in time
Send me to Jerusalem
Let me go
Let me go find Jesus
Let me save His life
As they try to kill Him
Let me take Him down
Down from the cross
Take the iron from His body
Try to heal His wounds
God said no
If I let you go
If you really found Him
Walking with the cross
You would stare
Your tongue no longer working
Eyes no longer seeing
Ears no longer hearing
God said Dan
Time belongs to me
Time's my secret weapon
A final advantage
God turned away
From the edge of town
He knew, I was beaten
And now was all I had
God said no

I thought the suits had come for me
Found alternatives to honesty
Body and soul were bought and sold
Patented and out of reach
So I reach but it hurts, it kills, it screams
And it fills my heart with chills
And I take my pills
But I'm still tired of sleeping with the light on
But if it keeps the hair out of my eyes
Pack it up and send it home
For just one stab at the good life
That's enough and I'm sold
So I gave up all my wretched thoughts
And left them out for the less fortunate
And at the gates I'll skip the queue
Life's not living 'less you're sure to make it through
But now it hurts, it kills, it screams
And it fills my heart with chills
And I take my pills
But I'm still tired of sleeping with the light on
But if it keeps the hair out of my eyes
Pack it up and send it home
For just one stab at the good life
That's enough and I'm sold
Lord, I'm sold
Go on pack me up, I'm sold
Go on pack me up, I'm sold
Go on pack me up, I'm sold
Go on pack me up, I'm sold
Go on pack me up, I'm sold
Go on pack me up, I'm sold
Pack me up, I'm sold
If it keeps the hair out of my eyes
Pack it up and send it home
For just one stab at the good life
That's enough and I'm sold

Sometimes I walk and wish L.A. were some small town in Monterey
I close my eyes and ask the Gods to make those Cadillacs, dusty dogs
I close my eyes and live, I close my eyes and live another day
Sometimes I think I'll melt away and in the sidewalk cracks I'll stay
And who will notice, who will call, 'cause life won't change much, if at all
I close my eyes and live, I close my eyes and live another day
Another day, so far from the farms where I grew up
Another day, another day, another day so far from that single pair of eyes
That speak to me of home, not another night alone
Another day is done, I lay my eyes to rest
There's food, I've got a bed and there's a roof above my head
Sometimes, I think that everyone really speaks a foreign tongue
Like I say 'X' and you hear 'Y' but I push these thoughts from my mind
And close my eyes and live, I close my eyes and live another day
I close my eyes and live, I close my eyes and live another day

I wanna kiss your stupid thumb
'cause I love when the days are long
I notice more of everything
might even try to be a friend
You hold my hair right by the end
and we hold hands around the bend
touch all the books outside The Strand
the oldest pages soft like sand
the oldest pages soft like sand

Someone reaching for me now
Through the dark, reaching for me now
Ooooh
Someone reaching for me now
Through the dark, reaching for me now
You need someone to hear you when you sigh
Someone to wipe away those tears you cry
Someone to hold you 'neath the darkened sky
Someone to love you more than I
Ooooh
I love you girl,
I love you more than I can say
I love you girl,
I love you more than I can say
Even with my heart in the way
Ooooh

It's time to love,
snow from above.
It's time to care,
winter is here.
A snow white kiss,
everything's bliss.
And on your nose,
summer tears froze.
A wintertime love,
a crystal clear love.
A snow white kiss,
everything is bliss.
And on your nose,
summer tears froze.
A wintertime love.
A wintertime love.
A crystal clear love.
A wintertime love.
A snow white kiss,
everything is bliss.
And on your nose,
summer tears froze.
A wintertime love.
A wintertime love.
A crystal clear love.
A wintertime love.
Love love love.
Who's hiding the tears above.
A wintertime love.

Look mom
They're gonna fry tim mcvay
She said 'the nice guy who's on the cover of all those magazines?
Why would they want to do a thing like that?'
I said cause he killed all those people
In oklahoma city
She said nonsense
People don't kill people
Carbombs kill people
I said well yea mom but they gotta do something with him
She said why don't they just get mike tyson
To bite off both his ears
And I said
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
It attracts too much attention
They never bomb buildings
A little girl down my block was born
With siliconin her breasts
It turned out her grandma and her mother
Both had the implants done well
Evolution took care of it this time around
And I wondered what it is about
So many women with big breasts
Make it look so sad and I thought well
Maybe it has something to do with the weight
The burden there is to carry in the world
To have to feed it
To be the object of its desires and
I wondered what burdens the rest of us
Are carrying all the time
I couldn't help thinking
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
It attracts too much attention
They never bomb buildings
I decided to go for a walk
And not do nothing except look everyone I see in the eyes
And not be the first one to avert my eyes
No matter what
And I was planning to be gone for 10 minutes
But things started happening and I didn't return for two years
By which time I was the heavyweight champion of the world
And the expectant father of 16 children
By 13 different women
I was in a fishing village in the coast of spain
It was our lady of abortions Sunday afternoon
All the pregnant women in their first trimester
Were filing before the priest
To receive their blessing of
Try again sometime, try again
The old barber had died his hair green for the occasion
And pierced his nipples and
Was riding his skateboard to the statue
Of conan o'brien
Where he was doing backflips for the kids
Who threw coins
Given to them by their parents
The visiting lecturer
Achingly handsome
Just finished giving a
How to build bombs in your basement
Seminar in the park
All the young girls put away their
Notebooks dreamily
The chimpanzee who had managed to
Type out hamlet three years before
Was sitting in the third floor office of a
Drivers license building
Typing out zoning ordinances
Typing out learners permits
Bored and lonely
Pee wee herman was sitting in the
Central square on the grass
Naked and masturbating
While all the townspeople moved to him
Slowly and kissed him softly and sung him
Lullabyes in the grass
And in burkley and in greenwhich village
And in paris and scottsbluff nebraska
No one sits around in funky little coffee shops
Anymore talking about revolution
No they get a starbucks to go
And they go back to their basketball games
Where they see who can jump higher
Who can jam
Who can take it to the rafts
And they all wear baseball caps
Except they don't say yankees or dodgers
They say nike, reebok, adidas
Cause the pro players don't play for teams anymore
They play for shoe companies
And the kids aren't fooled
Nah they're just biding their time
Waiting for the millennium to come
When all the computers will crash
Cause all the brilliant scientists of the world
Forgot to make them read
Zeros
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
It attracts too much attention
They never bomb buildings
Now sitting there with a head full of dark thoughts
Like I sometimes get
Suddenly everything cleared
And I realized the only purpose
For revolution is to be able to love
Who you want
How you want
When you want and
Where you want
So I took off all my clothes
Stole a boat and road out to the middle of the lake
And jumped in
And I looked back at you
And said come on
Get wet
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
True revolutionaries
Never bomb buildings
It attracts too much attention
They never bomb buildings
They never bomb buildings
They never bomb buildings

If i can't let this go
I'm telling you i won't make it another year
If i go all the way
I'm telling you i can see all these things coming clear
'cause we have so much love
But we need so much more
'cause we have so much love
But we need so much more
If we go on like this
I'm telling you we won't make it another year
But if we go all the way
I'm telling you we'll finally see all these roads coming clear
'cause we have so much love
But we need so much more
'cause we have so much love
But we need so much more
We have a fascination with the darkness
Although we're standing in light
We have the strongest sense of kindness
But still we can't treat our own selves right
We have so much love
But we need so much more
We have so much love
But we need so much more
We go further
We go further
We go further
We go further
'cause we have so much love
But we need so much more
'cause we have so much love
But we need so much more
We have a fascination with the darkness
Although we're standing in light
We have the strongest sense of kindness
But still we can't treat our own selves right
We have so much love
But we need so much more
We have so much love
But we need so much more
We go further
We go further
We go further

guns firing on a ridge down onto a quiet town
wind bellows up smoke to the breakdown in the blood soaked dawn
me and my friend we headed up to where they had set up
the shells dug up the sand as they let up
he shot two and I held them down
we chased them off early we held the sway, what I mean to say
is they lost their way, and they're out there now in the firing dark
and I hear them, and I think I see them coming
we're waiting, we're hiding, they're running
and we'll stay here until the dawn
later on we dreamt it was over but we saw the drover
in the middle they were ducking for cover, so we laid back down
they must of felt the coming of shadow and they were all aglow
near our burrow, and in the moon light we shot them down

Everything should be fine
You'll find things tend to stand in line
It's but a link in time
But I'm sure you'll let me try
No one is sitting on fire
So long we're waiting on by
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times, I sang
Your loss wasn't mine
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times, I sang
Your lust was mine
In your mind
Open (?)
In your mind
I will open (?)
I will open (?)
No one is sitting on fire
So long we're waiting on (?)
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your lust was mine
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your lust was mine

The times we had
Oh, when the wind would blow with rain and snow
Were not all bad
We put our feet just where they had, had to go
Never to go
The shattered soul
Following close but nearly twice as slow
In my good times
There were always golden rocks to throw
At those who admit defeat too late
Those were our times, those were our times
And I will love to see that day
That day is mine
When she will marry me outside with the willow trees
And play the songs we made
They made me so
And I would love to see that day
Her day was mine

Searching for reasons against truth,
withholding blossom against the bloom,
I seek the golden somewhere for me,
who told the prophets where to find,
their dying orders hung dry on the line,
I seek that symbol, but it don't seek me
The slow won't beat the fast,
there's no going back,
the heart only beats intact,
1985
1985 is feeling black
I saw the measure pour to fill the cup,
and what had spilled out, someone called it love,
we want the measure, not the flood,
so let the day break and the night stand still,
let the quaker try to have his fill,
no crying wolf now, not for me
Time it moves right along,
just another selfish song,
though the years have come and gone,
1985
1985
1985 is painted black

With this I'm scraping by
At least it's cute that I tried
I wrote some songs that I sung
And have you heard I am so young
So young
I heard about being young
But I'm not sure how it's done
Thought I heard a mumble
Something about fun
Fun
Fun
Easy for you to say I say
I say this to you
Every day
Easy for you to say
The sky is a special warring streak
Between balloons to moons a leak
Of light in a blue town like this
The clouds are you a sky or kiss
That never shows or comes alive
Oasis in the parking lot
I just wanna be alive that's it
Alive
Alive

When I went to your town on the wide open shore
Oh I must confess, I was drawn, I was drawn to the ocean
I thought it spoke to me, it said, "Look at us,
We're not churches, not schools, not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?"
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body
And that's when I came back to town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.
I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly, oh the ocean said
"What are you trying to find, I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors, I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean,"
But the ocean can't come to this town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.
And the ones that can know you so well are the ones that can swallow you whole.
I have a good and I have an evil, I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.
I didn't go back today
I wanted to show you that I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them
You said, "Let me tell you the song of this town"
You said, "Everything closes at five. After that, well, you just got the bars
You don't know how precious you are, walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean.

Going, my boat's leaving today.
Gonna get down to the water,
Gonna wash these blues away.
Man this city's taken too much from me,
Gonna head out to the country,
Find a place where I can breathe.
I've been working 9 to 5,
Trying to lead a gracious life,
But my hard work only ever went to keeping me in strife.
Gonna take another road.
Gonna find myself some soul.
Gonna do my best in every way,
To pay attention as I go.
Cash money,
Ain't got no use for you.
Unless you can buy me true love.
And it's funny,
How many time's they've proved,
That the only true fortune you can save,
Is the truth.
Slowly, time keeps slipping away.
Leaves still change their colours,
Prophets lay still in their graves.
Erasing all our liberties.
Gonna take this axe, apply it,
Chop injustice at its knees.
The fundamental laws,
Of suffering and of its cause,
Man they lay in being human.
Everybody has their flaws.
What if we could overcome,
Insecurity for love ?
Fear for empathy ?
Education in place of push and shove ?

Two sides of a river
The river rushes through
Two sides of a river
One for me and one for you
We can build a bridge or baby
We can jump in
See what the river do
It's two sides of a river
Great big river rushin' through
I know the tides of the river
Know how fast and how deep
I know the tides of a river
Hope and pray they don't shift in your sleep
'Cause the river bides its lonely loss
It has no vows to keep
I know the tides of a river
Pray, pray they don't shift in your sleep
I was a bride of the river
Before I ever met you
I was a bride of the river
Where it took me was all that I knew
Now I finally found a love to share my secrets with
Lots of things we can do
I was a bride of the river
That's where I learned to rock you
Now I finally found a love to share my secrets with
Lots of things we can do
I was a bride of the river
That's where I learned to rock you

I've been knockin' on that door in my sleep
Fighting the fireplace glow
Knockin' on that door in my sleep
Fighting the fireplace glow
To keep me away
To keep me away from home
Papa, get the rifle from its place above the French doors!
They're comin' from the woods!
Oh! They're comin' from the woods!
And mama you're running too
Oh! My mama, you're running too
Brother, I'm so sorry that you watched the paintings burn
I've been holding onto the gold
When letting go would free my hand
And I've been tying your tongue in a knot
Oh! I've been tying your tongue in a knot
To wrap this death
To wrap this death in a sheet
Papa, get the rifle from its place above the French doors!
They're comin' from the woods!
Oh! They're comin' from the woods!
And mama you're running too
Oh! My mama, you're running too
Brother, I'm so sorry that you watched the paintings burn

Dear Father I've got your photographs,
thank god for photographs , hip hip horray
dear Father I know you love to laugh though
most of your photographs didn't seem that way
Dear Father Can't let you go to sleep, An I still can't forget you walkin around.
Dear Father you're starring in my dreams you're stealing all the scenes, where did you go?
My wandering mind, I stumble through time, I sing through the air,
I'll look for you there,
Dear Father I never got to say goodbye, I was singin on the River Clyde, and I didn't know,
Dear Father I see you dancing still and i think i always will till the day I die
Dear Father I feel your healing hands, as I fall asleep i can, plain as the day.
Dear Father you're in my refection now as I reach out and touch you now where did you go?
Dear Father I'm still curious when you still make me furious it was so long ago.
Dear Father I've got your photographs,
thank god for photographs , hip hip horray

Jesus loves me
But not my wife
Not my nigger friends
Or their nigger lives
But jesus loves me
Dat for sure
'Cause the bible tell me so
Read your bible good and well
Don't forget about that apple spell
Don't fall in the wishing well
Wishing for heaven and gettin' hell
Wash behind your ears don't smell
Cover them freckles don't ask don't tell
Kiss your papa but not too long
Hold his hand
Don't do no wrong
Jesus loves me
But not my wife
Not my nigger friends
Or their nigger lives
But jesus loves me
Dat for sure
'Cause the bible tell me so
Hush don't cry
Dry them tears
Time'll wash away all them years
Scar or a bruise
Pick and choose
When you're all grown up
You'll have the blues
Life'll give you that wedding ring
Fancy cars and diamond things
You best believe in Jesus' way
And never fall asleep forgetting to pray
Jesus loves me
But not my wife
Not my nigger friends
Or their nigger lives
But jesus loves me
Dat for sure
'Cause the bible tell me so
'Cause the bible tell me so

The summer ends and we wonder where we are
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car
And you both look so young
And last night was hard, you said
You packed up every room
And then you cried and went to bed
But today you closed the door and said
"We have to get a move on.
It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead,
We push ourselves ahead."
And it was cloudy in the morning
And it rained as you drove away
And the same things looked different
It's the end of the summer
It's the end of the summer,
When you move to another place
And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same
She walked alone all spring,
She had a boyfriend when the summer came
And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm
They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn
And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving
So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves
She held on to his sleeves
And she doesn't want to let go
'Cause she won't know what she's up against
The classrooms and the smart girls
It's the end of the summer
It's the end of the summer
When you hang your flowers up to dry
And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head
It felt like the first day of school
But I was going to the moon instead
And I walked down the hall
With the notebooks they got for me
My dad led me through the house
My mom drank instant coffee
And I knew that I would crash
But I didn't want to tell them
There are just some moments when your family makes sense
They just make sense
So I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on
We walked out on the dark and frozen grass
The end of the summer
It's the end of the summer
When you send your children to the moon
The summer ends and we wonder who we are
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car
And today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree
I passed the farms that made it
Through the last days of the century
And I knew that I was going to learn again
Again, in this less hazy light
I saw the fields beyond the fields
The fields beyond the fields
And the colors are much brighter now
It's like they really want to tell the truth
We give our testimony to the end of the summer
It's the end of the summer,
You can spin the light to gold.

I need a piss
Wanna hate
Fuck it up

If at first you don't succeed at love
Just dream a little dream about a girl so real
When she don't call up no more, well
Never give up, you gotta believe it
If only in my dreams (only in my dreams)
If only in my dreams she'll be right there next to me
And if I could say, if only in my dreams
You're the luckiest girl
In the world there's no other girl luckier
You don't have to explain it
('Cause you're the one who's in love)
and we'll have so much fun
On the beach, on the ocean of my dreams
Even only in my dreams
If at first you don't succeed at love
Just dream a little dream about a girl so real
And when she don't call up no more, well
Don't ever give up, yeah you gotta believe it
If only in my dreams she'll be right there next to me
(Only in my dreams) Only in my dreams
And if I could say, if only in my dreams,
You're the luckiest girl
In the world there's no other girl luckier
You don't have to explain it
('Cause you're the one who's in love)
and we'll have so much fun
On the beach, on the ocean in my dreams
Yeah, only in my dreams
And if I could see
That you'll be real with me
And we'll have so much fun
And it's just begun
If only in my dreams (you're the luckiest girl)
In the world there's no other more luckier
You don't have to explain it
('Cause you're the one who's in love)
And we'll have so much fun
If only in my dreams

All I want is the best for our lives my dear,
And you know my wishes are sincere.
What's to say for the days I cannot bear
A Sunday smile you wore it for a while.
A cemetery mile we paused and sang.
A Sunday smile you wore it for a while.
A cemetery mile we paused and sang.
A Sunday smile and we felt true. (and)
We burnt to the ground
Left a view to admire
With buildings inside church of white.
We burnt to the ground left a grave to admire.
And as we reach for the sky, reach the church of white.
A Sunday smile you wore it for a while.
A cemetery mile we paused and sang.
A Sunday smile you wore it for a while.
A cemetery mile we paused and sang.
A Sunday smile and we felt true. (and)

When I was sixteen I cut myself a Mohawk,
Because I wanted to walk the walk,
And not just talk the talk,
But it was a bit of a disaster because
I did the sides with kitchen scissors,
Because I didn't have any clippers,
And I didn't want to use a beard-trimmer
I'd made that mistake before.
When you got home you didn't want to talk about what I'd done.
You said I'd let you down, I'd fucked around, when I was only having fun.
With the way that you've been lately, you've no right to scream and shout.
You and I, we've got a lot that we need to talk about.
What's the point in making vows that you're never going to keep?
A lifetime lying awake means you'll never get to sleep.
And all the promises you made, that were painful and untrue,
Of all the things you do they reflect worst on you.
We all have our own devices
For handling mid-life crises
Usually involves a motorbike and
Suspicious fashion decisions.
But you choose to stave off grey hairs by
Lamely hacking at the sides
With lies and flimsy alibis
For your suspicious expeditions.
When I get home I don't want to talk about what you've done.
Yes you've let me down, you've fucked around, but I guess you were having fun.
With the way that I've been lately, I've no right to scream and shout.
You and I, we've got a lot that we need to talk about.
You always told me Father's Day was just another way
Of selling Hallmark greeting cards
Twenty Years of waking sleep, of lying through your teeth,
Meant every Father's Day spent wondering who the hell you are.
What's the point in us making vows that we're never going to keep?
I keep trying to keep you up, but you keep on falling asleep.
And all the promises we made were painful and untrue,
But for better or for worse, I am turning into you.

Maybe I don't mind, just getting high in mine
Shouting over music with a friend who's like a brother
Because if I get time, I'd just regret most shit
From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide
Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight twice
Twice, it brung me down but it's the last time
Maybe I'll grow tired of you bitchin' all the time
'Cause when you love the way you're living, it get's hard to fret about much
Because if I got time I'd just regret most shit
From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide
Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight twice
Twice, it brung me down but it's the last time
Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight twice
Twice, it brung me down but it's the last time
From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide
Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight twice (yeah, twice)
Twice, it brung me down but it's the last time

Cynicism has such clamorous voice
that is easily heard as man's glamorous choice
Something rings clearly as though from afar
to illume our minds
and kindle our hearts
Love has overtaken us
Made our pulses pound
for a greater cause
Love is so that it never was
And it's everything
now that it has come to us
There are times when we may
have tried harder
But that's dreamy old now
replaced with such altar
Now our shields are all gone
We've laid our armor down
and surrender
coz it's all around.
Love has overtaken us
Now our hearts are pounding
for a greater cause
Love is so that it never was
It is everything
now that it has come to us
Some values will always last
Who wants to turn the wheel
Indifference waters down so fast
juxtaposed with sins
Love has overtaken us
And our hearts are pounding
for a greater cause
Love is so that it never was
It is everything
now that it has come to us

Did you know how much you meant to me? Oh no
Did you know I still carry the memories? Oh no
Did you know that for me letting go wasn't easy? Oh no
No, you don't
Do you still listen to our lullaby? Oh no
Does it help you get to sleep at night? Oh no
Are you singing along by the pale moonlight? Oh no
No, you don't
I just need a bit more time
To get you off my mind tonight
I'm thinking of your bright blue eyes
Brighter than the stars that lit the sky
An angel in disguise
I just a need a bit more time
Wanna hold you in my arms tonight
I can't forget those bright blue eyes
Can't forget the moment they met mine
Please turn back the time

One summer night
I will call you up
Summer night
You will fall in love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I ask you to be
One summer night
I will break your love
Summer night
I will miss your love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When i ask you forever ever more
Fantasies and fallacies
Are fairy tales and lies
Time is running out
Yeah
Better write these lines
One summer night
I will call you up
Summer night
You will fall in love
Now that you're gone
I can't go living every night
When I ask you to be

The blue it speaks so full
It's like the beauty, one can barely stand
Or too much things dropped in your hand
And there's a green like the peace in your heart sometimes
Painted underneath the sheets of ashy snow
And there's a blue like where the urban angels go, very bright
Now the Calder mobile tips a biomorphic sphere
Then it swings its dangling pieces, round to other paintings here
Your behavior is so male
It's like, you can't explain yourself to me
I think, I'll ask Renoir to tea
For his flowers are as real as they are all the time
And the sunlight sets the furniture aglow
It's a pleasant time as far as people go, how far do they go?
Well his roses are perfect and his words have no wings
I know what he can give me and I like to know these things
I met her at the funeral
She said, "I don't know what he meant to me
I just know he affected me
An effect not unlike his art, I believe"
The service starts and we are in the know
He had so much to say but more to show and ain't that true of life?
So we weep for a person who lived at great cost
Yet we barely knew his powers 'til we sensed that we had lost
A friend and I in a museum room
She says, "Look at Mark Rothko's side
Did you know about his suicide?"
Some folks were born with a foot in the grave but not me, of course
And she smiles as if to say, we're in the know
Then she names a coffee place where we can go, uptown
Now the painting is desperate but the crowds wash away
In a world of kind pedestrians who've seen enough today

One, two, three, four
Oh, somewhere down the road, there's a ditch where there's a hole
Which marks the spot where you will lie when you are cold
And you can run, you can hide, you can bitch and you can whine
But you will never save your life
When you meet death
Be out of breath
And say you're pleased to see him 'cause you're tired
Now you can go down with the wreck or you can scurry from the deck
But there's no way to save your skinny little neck
And you can pray to who you please, and you can fall down on your knees
But your feet will still get wet
When you meet death
Be out of breath
And say you're pleased to see him 'cause you're tired
Of wondering how much time you've got left
Of worrying that you're no good at chess
It's your funeral anyway
Choose your game
Then let's play
When you meet death
Be out of breath
And say you're pleased to see him
In fact you're waiting for this meeting
And quite frankly his timekeeping leaves a lot to be desired
So tell that [?] bastard that he's fired

I'm bipolar, nobody knows it, but me,
I make bad decisions and everyone sees them, but me,
I think I'll have a baby with the man who beats me,
who abuses and confuses me and also threatens to kill me,
but I think I'll keep the baby, though everyone says, I'm not right in the head,
though that's not heard from heart.
Everyone is criticising, picking fights with me,
I'm recklessly aggressive, I'll talk [?]
but the love of a child will heal my broken heart,
but babies don't need daddies, fathers can be forgotten,
so I think I'll keep the baby, though everyones says, I'm not right in the head,
though it's not heard from my heart.
I'm bipolar [x3]
nobody knows it, nobody knows,
nobody knows [x3]
I think I'll keep the baby,
nobody knows [x5]
I think I'll keep the baby.

Traveling in a fried-out combie
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said
Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover
Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
And he said
I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover
Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty?"
And he said
Oh, do you come from a land down under
(Oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover

Wandering lonely through the snow streets of New York
I stumbled on a thrift store that sold postcards by the yard
I bought a mile and shipped them home so I could read
Ten thousand ten-word tragedies, the lives these strangers lead
To remind myself the things I need
Cause I once wrote you love songs
You never fell in love
We used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves
You left me feeling like
We'd never really been in love
Huddled home up in my place, in Holloway
I wondered if you ever heard those songs I used to play
I wrote them as a gift for you and in return
You gave a pair of hand knit mittens to keep my fingers warm
So I could play more ignored love songs
I once wrote you love songs
You never fell in love
We used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves
And I once wrote you postcards
You never wrote back
Promised me you would and I'm still waiting for them
You left me feeling like
We'd never really been in love
Don't wanna fit like mittens
I wanna fit like gloves
Wanna fit like gloves
I once wrote you love songs
You never fell in love
We used to fit like mittens but never like gloves
Never like gloves

Paul McCartney and Ringo Star
Are the only Beatles in the world
Are ya getting hungry?
Do you feel like dancing
Do you wanna be my girl
RickiTickiTicki Canta el Troubador
Como la flor mas gorda que no tiene sabor
Que rica es la vida que rico es el amor
Mata el Toro no mates al toreador
Yo si oiga a Donovan
Yo si oiga a Marc Bolan
Yo si oiga a Ben Chasny
A Six Organs me gust a mi

[Solo 1]
She stands at six feet tall,
with her back to the wall.
Her voice is soft as Sahara's sand
on the dryest land.
Put my faith in the swan on the water,
there is more to her tan you could know
when the jewels are raining down,
to sit on broken ground
[Pre-Chorus]
She'll be there,
when the wall falls down.
Don't be scared,
if it all comes down.
[Chorus]
Love me to pieces,
hold my hands high,
lift my head up towards
blinding light. (2x)
[Solo 2]
We're dancing like we're dumb
under summer stars,
but the light was playing tricks
almost taken too far.
When we're falling all over the place
and her lust is enough to take,
those lips are burning red,
still like a day when we met.
[Pre-Chorus]
She'll be there,
when the wall falls down.
Don't be scared,
if it all comes down.
[Chorus]
Love me to pieces,
hold my hands high,
lift my head up towards
blinding light. (2x)
[Outro]
And I'm begging mercy;
just hold my heart,
from the depths of my chest. (2x)

Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to say what's going on
Still a little bit of your ghost your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
So I can say what's going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
Life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball
Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer each day
So close that I can't see what's going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
Life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to cry
So come on courage!
Teach me to be shy
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't want to scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't want to lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you just don't know

There was a summer breeze
All things a blurry dream
In the shade of the tree
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
If you fall in love with me
So who's your mama now?
Now that it's all over
'Cause you've got to set me free
Oh, you've got to set me free [x2]
Shadow in a thicket
A dog sounding yonder
Barks a bother
Windy Christian music tickling a-lofty
Hear the seashells chatter
The black berriless makes a mutter
We're all searching for our mother
Broken hearted brother
Bloody nose, toes, horse hoof and thunder
I'm standing in the open
I'm wondering where I am now
A solitary soldier saluting heavenwards and nothing
The tiny song of bramble
You know her amble movements
She's been here now forever
Mother nature clever
So who's your daddy now?
Now that it's all over
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
So who's your daddy now?
There was a summer breeze
All things a blurry dream
In the shade beyond the tree
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
If you fall in love with me
So who's your mama now?
Now that it's all over
'Cause you've got to set me free
Oh, you've got to set me free [x2]
What happened to the old tire swing?
Swung too many swungses
Oh burned-out foxhole of childhood longing
Yearning for the summer
School will soon be over
There ain't nothing to kiss but a bull frog and a horse hoof
Pile of dung
Cracked out and bee stung
Rainwater flow through the money tracks
Tractor tracks tire tracks
I hear footsteps the ghosts of cats
Might be that old tom who got murdered by the nurse
Who rides that old motorcrycle?
Maybe someone young and virile
I want a cup of tea so bad it's making my wood...
Get hold of yourself, Grandpa!
Do you want to take me beachcombing, world roaming?
Do you want to be my partner?
There was a summer breeze
All things a blurry dream
In the shade of the tree
There's no more lucky clover
It's the last September ever
If you fall in love with me
So who's your mama now?
Now that it's all over
'Cause you've got to set me free
Oh, you've got to set me free [x2]
Oh, you've got to set me free, set me free
Oh you've got to, you've to, set me free, set me free

The first girl that I fell for was a fair and faithful fighter
She smoldered with a will to save the world
I did my best to help her, yeah I stood shoulder to shoulder
On the front lines with my visionary girl
I wish that she had cared for me
But in the end her ideologies
Occupied the fortress of her heart
I wrote her 15 songs, but still we had to part
And if music was the food of love
Then I'd be a fat romantic slob
Well music, it's my substitute for love
The last girl that I loved she was a low and lusty liar
She set my heart on fire, but made me choke
Her beauty was a sight to see, but she didn't save it all for me
I found other fires by following the smoke
I wish that she had either cared for me or
Let me be
But she chased me from mind and from my home
I wrote her 16 songs, but I ended up alone
And if love is really all that we need
Then even all my singing is never gonna save me
Music it's my substitute for love
Well I've had many different girls inside my bed
But only one or two inside my head
These days I cuddle up to my guitar instead
But oh, what I would give, not to stumble but to really fall in love
And I could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me

I want to stay
Out all night
With you
Yeah you make my world all right
No sun was up
Today we didn't mind
Too busy making the rain shine
And there goes
Everything
And I don't care
Yeah there goes
Everything
And I just don't care
As long as you're near
I gotta stay
Out all night
'Til I'm back feeling alright
And there goes
Everything
And I don't care
Yeah there goes
Everything
And I just don't care
As long as you're near

If only all our memories were one
we only had to blink and it was done
if all the world could see it with one eye
in perfect color to the perfect sky
if only we could turn ourselves around
and all the things we're looking for were found
if only we grew wiser with each breath
if only we could dance our way to death
if only all our dreams were coming true
maybe there'd be some time for me and you
if only all the world could sing along
in perfect rhythm to the perfect song
if only all our hopes were to be here
we'd just close our eyes when we want to disappear
if only all the love we needed was gained
if only we could always stay the same
if only we could always stay the same

She said "hello mister, please to meet ya"

Yeah, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Seems like you're always a million miles away
As far as I'm concerned that's where you can stay
But all the time I'm reminded
Used to be a time we had a lot in common
But now as far as I can see you got something coming
And all the time you're behind me
And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time
It's easy living in a bubble
And no complication or trouble
But it's hard to have responsibility
And judging by you, a personality
And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time
And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time
I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
It's like blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time

I love you so much, I could leave you
I could wait around for another you
To come along and admit
What's gone wrong is no ones fault
And I love you so much, I could leave you
The silence comes to a close
As the leaves fall to the ground
I can't believe a year's gone by
And it feels like I just found out
That I, I love you
Just leave me be and I'll let you breathe
I'll let you seek out all that you wish to seek
'Cause I love you so much, I could leave you tonight
My bed will stay cold till the morning light wakes me
Or until it breaks me
The silence comes to a close
As the leaves fall to the ground
I can't believe a year's gone by
And it feels like I just found out
That I, that I love you
And I love you
Well, I love you so much
I like the fact you tend to ride out on your bike
And come home after forging for the lonely likes of me
Me, me

Strollin' past the Daffodils
I won't forget how it feels
To be lost in the maze.
Laying on the sun kissed patch
Of grass we found round the back
Of that palace garden place
There wasn't a cloud in sight,
Nor people strolling by.
You held your hand in mine and I sighed,
For there was not much
To be found in your eyes
Oh, of all the sights I've seen
Never knew it'd be you me and Buckley Bee
In the cool, warm shade.
And I should of kissed your face
I should've explored all the places
Ooh, oh my
How you seem to make me shy
Ooh, and every time you kiss me on the lips
I think of how I could get used to this.
Used to your kisses
So wakey, wakey, rise and shine
So wakey, wakey, rise and shine,
T'was another lovely evening again last night
Honestly did I not oblige to your every whim,
Seen as I was beholden?
Ooh, oh my
How you seem to make me shy
Ooh, and every time you kiss me on the lips
I think of how I could get used to this
So wakey, wakey, rise and shine
Ooh, oh my
How you seem to make me shy
Ooh, and every time you kiss me on the lips
I think of how I could get used to this

I bear no grudge, even though my heart may break
Eternally lost love, I bear no grudge
Though you're shining in your diamond splendor
No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart
I've known it well for a long time, I bear no grudge
Ich grolle nicht
Und wenn das Herz auch bricht
Ewig verlornes Lieb, ich grolle nicht
Though you're shining in your diamond splendor
No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart
I've known it well for a long a time, I bear no grudge
I saw you in a dream, I saw the darkness in your heart
I saw the snake that feeds upon your heart
I saw, my love, how utterly wretched you are
I bear no grudge, I bear no grudge
I'm over you, so, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on back to me, okay, alright

The morning has no sympathy
It just screams across the room
Making light of everything
Taking you
And now I've got a creature on my mind
Go chase your dragon and I'll chase mine
They say time is just one long straight line
And they can deaden a girl while she's still alive
Well, man, we've had one hell of a ride
Go chase your dragon and I'll chase mine
I know I know I know I know
The sweeter it gets the deeper you go
I don't think we're coming back this time
Man, go chase your dragon and I'll chase mine
Now there's nothing left to say that's true
So forget about me and I'll forget about you
Well I'm going to find a way to catch that sun
And then I'll leave you behind my beautiful one

Where did you go
When things went wrong for you
When the knives came out for you?
Where did you go?
All you needed was a friend
You just have to ask and then
You don't have to have the solution
You've got to understand the problem
And don't go hoping for a miracle
All this will fade away
So I'm coming home
What did you learn
Locked away all on your own
Chance and your head all blown
What did you learn
It was unfortunate
You missed you chance to find out that

Where do we go
When we are down to our last night
And we are all grown up
Get to the point
See if we know what it looks like
And I will show you love
I don't want to go
I don't want to stay
I feel a little bit of something in my way
I don't want to go
I just want to feel tonight
And I hear you saying
Goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodbye
Where will we see
And what do you think we'll dream about
When we are standing outside in a middle of a lonely road
We're staring down youth
Everyone else will get knocked out
But we will not get old
I don't want to go
I don't want to stay
I feel a little bit of something in my way
I don't want to go
I just want to feel tonight
And I hear you saying
Goodnight goodnight
Goodnight goodnight goodbye
I don't know where
I don't know why
But we are here tonight
We will all take flight
And our future's all feel bright
I don't want to go
I don't want to stay
I feel a little bit of something in my way
I don't want to go
I just want to feel tonight
And hear you saying goodnight goodnight
And I hear you saying goodnight goodnight
And I hear you saying goodnight
And I hear you saying goodnight goodnight tonight
Goodnight goodnight goodbye

Loretta broke my heart in a letter
Told me she was leaving and her life would be better
Joan broke it off over the phone
After the tone she left me alone
Jen said she'd never ever see me again
When I saw her again, she said it again
Jan met another man
Liza got amnesia, just forgot who I am
Felicity said there was no electricity
Emily, no chemistry
Fran, ran, Bruce turned out to be a man
Flo had to go, I couldn't go with the flow
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around
He doesn't cook or clean
He's not good boyfriend material
Ooh, we can eat cereal
You'll lose interest fast,, his relationships never last
Shut up girlfriends from the past
He says he'll do one thing and then he goes and does another thing
Ooh
Who organized all my ex-girlfriends into a choir
And got them to sing?
Ooh ooh ooh, shut up
Shut up girlfriends from the past
Mimi will no longer see me
Brittany, Brittany hit me
Paula, Persephone, Stella, and Stephanie
There must be fifty ways that lovers have left me
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
Love is a delicate thing, you can't just throw it away on the breeze
He said the same thing to me
How can we ever know if I'm the right person in this world
That means he looks at other girls
Love is a mystery, it does not follow rules
This guy is a fool
He'll always be a boy, hes a man who never grew up
I thought I told you to shut up
Mona, you told me you were in a coma
Tiffany, you said that you had an epiphany
Mm
Would you like a little cereal?
Who organized this choir of ex-girlfriends?
Was it you Carol Brown?
Was it you Carol Brown?
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around

You can hold her hand
And show her how you cry
Explain to her your weakness so she understands
And then roll over and die
You can brave decisions
Before you crumble up inside
Spend your time asking everyone else's permission
Then run away and hide
You can sit on chimneys
With some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're doing or waiting for
But if ever anyone should ask
Tell them, I've been licking coconut skins,
And we've been hanging out.
Tell them, God just dropped by to forgive our sins,
And relieve us our doubt.
You can hold her eggs
But your basket has a hole
You can lie between her legs and go looking for'
Tell her you're searching for her soul
You can wait for ages
Watch your compost turn to coal
But time is contagious
And everybody's getting old
So you can sit on chimneys
With some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're doing or looking for
But if ever anyone should ask
Tell them, I've been cooking coconut skins,
And we've been hanging out.'
Tell them, 'God just dropped by to forgive our sins,
And relieve us our doubt.

Well. this has got to die
I said, this has got to stop
This has got to lie down
With someone else on top
You can keep me pinned
'Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't paint an elephant
Quite as good as she
And she may cry like a baby
And she may drive me crazy
'Cause I am lately
Lonely
So why'd you have to lie?
I take it I'm your crutch
The pillow in your pillow case
Is easier to touch
When you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
Or just sit within your picture
You still forget the breeze
And she may rise
If I sing you down
And she may wisely
Cling to the ground
'Cause I am lately
Horny
So why would she take me horny?
What's the point of this song?
Or even singing?
You've already gone
Why am I clinging?
Well I could throw it out
And I could live without
And I could do it all for you
I could be strong
Tell me, do you want me to lie?
Because this has got to die
'Cause this has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down
With someone else on top
You can both keep me pinned
'Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't make me happy
Quite as good as me...
(you know that's a lie)

Old man sits at his desk
One year from retirement
And he's up for review
He's not quite sure what to do
Each passing year
The workload grows
I'm always wishing
I'm always wishing too late
For things to come my way
It always ends up the same
And I must be missing
I must be missing the point
Your signal fades away
And all I'm left with is noise
So wait up
I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
There's so much to dream about
There must be more to my life
Poor little tin man
Still swinging his axe
Even though, even though
His joints are clogged with rust
My youth is slipping
My youth is slipping away
Safe in monotony
Day after day
My youth is slipping
My youth is slipping away
Cold wind blows off the lake
And I know for sure that it's too late
So wait up
I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
There's so much to dream about
There must be more to my life
Wait up
I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
Between the light and shallow waves
Is where I'm going to die
So won't you wait up for me?
Won't you wait up for me?
Won't you wait up for me?
Oh, wait up for me

She fell of cliff on sunday
Her showers are free for
Her image kind to you
Who focus for some strong
For strangers are
And I wanna any race
From brainwasher
No one can move you
I see right through you
She found a machine for dances
For future
For setting site
For setting song
Said inside
No one can move you
I see right through you

I woke up today with a darkness keeping me cold
Wild bird flocks guarding my home
I don't know what to do
My eyes gone black from the stolen heart that I gave to
you.
Darkness keeps me all alone
Darkness eats away at the place that we're calling
our home.
I went to bed on a starless night
I took the bus downtown in the morning light
And hung your ghost from the power lines
Your crooked mouth trying hard not to say goodbye
Saying 'I won't ask you'
Darkness keeps me all alone
Darkness eats away at the place that we're calling
our home.
While you're dreaming I can barley breathe
I tell you that I love you but you don't mean shit to me
It's like we're living in a fantasy
And I'm watching you try to pretend that you're asleep
But I won't wake you.
I know a place where we can go tonight
Where we can trade all of our money for a homesick fade
to white.
You tell me that you never want to leave
And you hang your body form the balcony and swing.
Saying please just let me let go.
Darkness keeps me all alone
Darkness eats away at the place that we're calling
our home.

[Chorus]
I saw you
Oh how I wish it were me (I wish that it were me)
How did he win your heart?
When you really need a rider like me on your team
Girl can? you see
First of all, shorty off the top I'm not trying to hate
I've seen how he had operate
And he seem so lame to me (he seem so lame to me)
Here where you ought to be
Baby tell me why
Why you waste your time
Being he treats you so bad
Keep you feeling so sad
When will you come along to the arms of a G like me?
I can? stand you with him
You should be with me
[Chorus]
What I gotta do to get through to you
Girl you can leave this behind
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Cause every time I see you with him
I don't want to believe you chose him over me
When I'ma lil man with grown pockets
All you have to do is make one wish
And I will come to you and set you free
And every part of this heart of mine is your

Echoes of another time
Playing lightly on my mind
There's many rivers still cross
To temper bitterness and loss,
Though what you say is true
This might be it for me and you
Maybe we can draw that line
Maybe another time.
Well I wanna do what's right
But maybe not tonight.
Memories of another town
Those pretty eyes, that pretty frown.
In the long grass where we lay
And let the whole world fall away.
And though in time we've walked apart,
You were always in my heart
Maybe we should say goodbye
But maybe not tonight.
I remember you were just a child
Burning brightly and running wild
We married on an August night
No priest, no church, just the big moon shining bright.
Maybe we should be moving on,
And figure what is done is done
Maybe we should break those vows
But maybe not right
Maybe we should do what's right
But baby not tonight.
Maybe we should both just do what's right
But baby not tonight.

God knows I've tried to bridge the gap
I've tried to be me and time after time I've lied
Just to say the things you wanted to hear
Look, look what I've done, look what I do
I'm starting to pull myself through
Hell could feasibly freeze, but in your eyes I'll always be
The fountainhead, the boy whose thoughts keep running away
And you know I'm right
Wasn't it you who said
That when looking to open the eyes in my head
And now I can see from your mistakes
You're as blind as me
God knows I've tried, god knows I try
To be something more than I am
Hell could feasibly freeze, but in your eyes I'll always be
The fountainhead, the boy whose thoughts keep running away
And you know I'm right
What can I say about being a fount?
It's a game that we play it goes round and around
I shall stick to the rules but I won't suffer fools
And I won't lose the plot and I won't lose my cool
Can't you see what I've done, can't you see what I do
It's not really unique and it's hopelessly crude
But these are my decisions, these are my mistakes
And I'll fall down again if that's what it takes

GEMMA HAYES LYRICS
I Worked Myself Into A Calm
A slow walk
Will do you good
Try and take it all in
You said
You'll hold me down
Show me how to turn this mess around
You can cry
No one is looking at you
You can cry, cry
Can't stay
Out of luck
Have trouble trying to wake myself
That's alright
I caught myself
Dragged me up to better health
You can cry
No-one is looking at you
You can cry, cry
You can cry
No one is looking at you
You can cry, cry
All good things must change
And i'd fight it
If i could
All good things must change
I worked myself into a calm
I worked myself
You can cry
No-one is looking at you
You can cry, cry
You can cry
No one is looking at you
You can cry, cry
All good things must change
And i'd fight it, if I could
All good things must change

I sure hope that you're not riding
on a bicycle for two
I've seen my share of girls, and well,
there has been no one like you
Your smile makes me forget my worries
While your eyes say " I love you"
My heart is jumping, arms goosebumping
and it's only been a minute or two
I can't help but wonder
If you'll slip away just like the rest
What if we had met from the start?
Would my words come out then fall apart
It feels like when you're around
It's a good thing I have found
And while we're mingling
I'll hold you near to me
Because it feels like when you're around
It's a good thing I have found
A pocketful of dried fruit peels
I prefer to potpourri
It's just the pattern of the rose
that is tingling my nose
And each day is four
Until the day I get to see your more
If it's a dream I'm in, well
I don't ever wanna wake up
I can't help but wonder
If you'll slip away just like the rest
What if we had met from the start?
Would my words come out then fall apart
It feels like when you're around
It's a good thing I have found
And while we're mingling
I'll hold you near to me
Because it feels like when you're around
It's a good thing I have found
I hope you can tell
That I mean I you only well
You get inside my head
and I wanna be with you
And as the days go by
I sit and wish that I was the guy
who found you first
If I had it any other way
than I am having today
I would be so happy and excited

Clinging onto something false again
Feeling like I am 6 years old
Gotta find a way to break you down
Pushing till you let me in
You don't have to be alone
Maybe you're not,I wouldn't know
Cause you keep it all locked up
You don't have to be alone
Maybe you're not,I wouldn't know
Cause you keep it all locked up
Bailing out of all my plans again
Failing doesn't seem so wrong
Crawling back under the sheets again
Wanna sleep until its done
What was I thinking?I am a dime a dozen
Don't wanna think about the rules
What's the point in holding back in what you're wanting?
They won't matter when we're through
You don't have to be alone
Maybe you're not,I wouldn't know
Cause you keep it all locked up
You don't have to be alone
Maybe you're not,I wouldn't know
Cause you keep it all locked up
My little heart is turning black
For your heart,but I've got your back
Waiting up for some love
That never comes
I'm a mess,I'm a wreck
But you wouldn't know
Cause am at my best
When I'm with you,when I'm with you
I'm a mess,I'm a wreck
But you wouldn't know
Cause am at my best
When I'm with you,when I'm with you

Please believe in what I say
Cause' I'm running out of ways to convey
This lack of faith in myself
That's becoming my own personal health
Vicious settles in
My bones feel like they're breaking through my skin
Well God damn you
You're feeding on my loneliness
What an awful way to live
What a way to live
Get me out of this place
Cause' I'm stuck in a rut
And I cannot
My lungs are filling up with dust
I feel bruised and broken with no one left to trust
Vicious settles in
My bones feel like they're breaking through my skin
Well God damn you
You're feeding on my loneliness
But I will not let you win
I won't let you win

"He's a quiet man," that's all she said
And he's a thoughtful man
It's just he likes to keep his thoughts up in his head
And we finally meet, and she tries to draw him out a bit
She says "He's writing something,
Hey now, why don't you talk about it?"
And he doesn't make a sound
He's just staring at his coffee
And I know there's all this beauty
And this greatness she'll defend
But I think it's in my friend
I have a friend in a bright and distant town
She's found a common balance
Where you do your work, and you do your love
And they pay you, and praise your many talents
Well I'm passing through, and we know we won't sleep
She laughs, puts up the tea
She says "You know I think you remember every part of me."
And the water starts to boil
And if I had a camera
Showing all the light we give
And showing where the light extends
I'd give it to my friends
Sometimes I see myself fine, sometimes I need a witness
And I like the whole truth
But there are nights I only need forgiveness
Sometimes they say "I don't know who you are
But let me walk with you some"
And I say "I am alone, that's all
You can't save me from all the wrong I've done."

I knew a guy
I thought he was my first love
But he had to decide
Between me and the one before
And she stacked it all up
Like a house of cards
Said if he didn't come back
He'd find her flattened on the floor
And though I went and lived in my own hell
Thought that I could die as well
I let him go where he thought he had to go
[Chorus]
Cause I never took
Heavy words for granted
And I never took
Undeserved advantage
No I never took
The easy way
So why don't you take it a little easy on me now?
Out on the road
I had so many questions
I thought I would explode
Just for some attention
Like an acolyte
I saw the flames of towering tapers
Almost proselytized by those gleaming piles of paper
Yeah I watched the power huddles
And the coats draped over puddles
And trust me baby, I'm the one you need
[Chorus]
Cause we all want to be the ones
Who lie, cheat, and slander
So we hold each other up to a higher standard
But I'll tell you what
I never try to make it hurt
Because when your heart
Just to be whole
The only thing that's hard is you
So here's what I took
I kept the wine and laughter
Until every pack
It just grew up and ever after
Through the peaks and twisty canyons
I made many great companions
Best of all is the one who loves me like you do
[Chorus]
Cause I never took
Heavy words for granted
And it's much too late
To even want a shortcut
Yeah I never took
The easy way
So you can take it a little easy now.
Because we know that easy is never easy anyhow.

Wanna know what I'm thinking, why I can't sleep at night
Wanna know what I'm drinking, a double of anything's fine
'cause I'm alright now, 'cause I'm alright
I'm alright
Wanna know what it feels like, to be so far from home
I've been on the wrong side baby for so long
That it feels right now, it feels right
It feels right
Keep falling, until you can't fall no more
Until you feel like, you've been falling for way too long
Then you will know about me, baby, you'll know about me
Then you will know about me
Wanna know where we're heading, when we all get kicked out
I see you carefully treading on the fire I already put out
That's alright now, that's alright
That's alright
Wanna know where it's going, well I guess that depends
Meet me back at the start, back at the part where we know how it ends
It ends alright now, it ends alright
It ends alright
Keep falling, until you can't fall no more
Until you feel like, you've been falling for way too long
Then you will know about me, baby, you'll know about me
Then you will know
About me
It's alright now, it's alright
It's alright.

I get so get so distracted
By some peoples reactions
That I don't see my own faults
For what they are
For what they are
At times so self destructive
With no intent or warning
But behind this emotion
There's a sensible heart
A sensible heart
I'm no king, I wear no crown
But desperate times seem over now
Yet still I weaken somehow
And it tears me apart
It tears me apart
Well I hope to learn as time goes by
That I should trust what's deep inside
Burning bright, oh burning bright
My sensible heart

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
Perhaps it's just imagination
Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night from overkill
Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day
I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
It's just overkill
Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away

Let's make a toast to glory days
When you were 8 and I was only 41
I dedicate this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done
Look into my camera lens
And straight through me I see that you're a lot like me
You never get attention and you never get a pension
Or your dad's money
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
I backed up all my pictures on my iCloud
So you can't see me when I die
I left my body somewhere down in Mexico
Give "Find My iPhone" app a try
Let's make a toast to glory days
When you were 8 and I was only 45
I dedicate to this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone, picture me gone
Picture me gone
Picture me gone

Everyone knows I'm a happy man
But I haven't been great
I sit all alone painting pictures
That don't turn out how I like
[Chorus]
In a room full of quite
With a head full of thoughts
If you're looking for me
I'll be where we left off
[Verse 2]
Everyone knows I'm a silly man
I love hearing your laugh
If I've been cruel
It's because I'm insecure
And just can't lose my grasp
[Chorus - Variation]
I'm so in love with you
I don't wanna stop
If you're looking for me
I'll be where we left off
[Bridge]
Silver morning on the shore
You wear your yellow coat and white pants
The horizon was lost
[Verse 3]
Everyone's hoping that love can fix
Their brokenness
So many times I couldn't help feel
Like I was helpless
[Chorus - Variation]
There's no one inside
No stars to cross
If you're looking for me
I'll be where we left off

I don't know what you've been told
But I don't get out much these days
Waking young and feeling old
The days are no longer my own
To piss away the waking hours
But don't, don't, don't
Don't let them go
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let them go to waste
The fire in my eye
Is fleeting now
Your robot heart is bleeding
Tried to be the robot king
And settled for a robot boy
Ring the bells that still can ring
And sing your stupid head off to
The ones who are not listening
But don't, don't, don't
Don't let them go
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let them go to waste
The fire in my eye
Is fleeting now
Your robot heart is bleeding out
And I've spent half of my life
In the customer service line
Flaws in the design
A sign of the times
And that little voice
In the back of your mind
Just wants you to know
Just hopes you know
Robots need love too
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by
Robots need love too
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by
Robots need love too
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by
Robots need love too
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by you
They want to be loved by you

Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
It's left this house empty now, not sure if I belong
Yesterday you asked me to write you a pleasant song
I'll do my best now but you've been gone now for so long
The window's open now and the winter settles in
We'll call it Christmas when the adverts begin
I love your depression and I love your double chin
I love most everything you bring to this offering
Oh I know that I've left you in places of despair
Oh I know that I love you so please throw down your hair
At night I dream without you
And hope I don't wake up
Cause waking up without you
Is like drinking from an empty cup
Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
Our clocks are ticking now so before our time is gone
We can get a house and some boxes on the lawn
We can make babies and accidental songs
I know I've been a liar and I know I've been a fool
I hope we didn't break it but I'm glad we broke the rules
My cave is deep now yet your light is shining through
I cover my eyes, still all I see is you
Oh I know I've left you in places of despair
Oh I know that I love you so please throw down your hair
At night I dream without you
And hope I don't wake up
Cause waking up without you
Is like drinking from an empty cup

hello, how you doin?
glad I crossed your path today
no I'm nothing really special
but I got a lot to say
man that smile how it holds me
and catches me off guard
and that voice how it moulds me
and shapes my broken heart
you
you got a hold on me
yeah you
you got a hold on me
you
you got a hold on me
and that's okay
cause I wouldn't have it any other way
I love the way you stain your t-shirts
everytime you eat
and nothing could replace the sight of you
every night you sleep

Underneath the moon I've called a thousand different names
None of them ever answer me back
In the night time I know
A familiar kind of peace
Oh, like it's something I used to have.
I'm poised in a proposition I don't know
Any detail...
I'm caught in a mess hall that I can't keep
Healthy and clean, ooo...
Lay beside the river bed and maybe I will sleep.
Oh, if my mind could just forget.
I spend so much time focused on how I should remember
Oh, what a burden that has been
I'm born in a body that I can't stand...
Up straight.
I'm caught in a situation I don't know,
How I got in to.
Oh I live in a home without any doors...
Free me, free me ohhh
The river is building the flow
It's growing as high as it will go
Bending and twisting, oh oh oh
Storm isn't over, no.
The storm isn't over, no...
Kos the storm isn't over, oh.
Oh no oh love,
I was buried in it all.
Oh love,
I was buried in it all.
Lay down, lay down.
Lay down, ohhh ohh ohhh oh
Lay down, lay down.
Lay down, ohhh ohh...

I threw your keys in the water, I looked back,
They'd frozen halfway down in the ice.
They froze up so quickly, the keys and their owners,
Even after the anger, it all turned silent, and
The everyday turned solitary,
So we came to February.
First we forgot where we'd planted those bulbs last year,
Then we forgot that we'd planted at all,
Then we forgot what plants are altogether,
and I blamed you for my freezing and forgetting and
The nights were long and cold and scary,
Can we live through February?
You know I think Christmas was a long red glare,
Shot up like a warning; we gave presents without cards,
And then the snow,
And then the snow came, we were always out shoveling,
And we'd drop to sleep exhausted,
Then we'd wake up, and its snowing.
And February was so long that it lasted into March
And found us walking a path alone together.
You stopped and pointed and you said, "That's a crocus,"
And I said, "What's a crocus?" and you said, "It's a flower,"
I tried to remember, but I said, "What's a flower?"
You said, "I still love you."

I'll take the sun and watch it surround you
All of the rain will follow all around you
And I, I'll pull you closer when you're floating far away
And I, don't need no reason we'll just get away
When we sail into the sun, into the sun
Sail into the sun, into the sun
I'll make the clouds a carpet and canopy
Won't touch the ground, I'll stay up here just you and me
And I, I'll pull you closer when you're floating far away
And I, don't need no reason we'll just get away
When we sail into the sun, into the sun
Sail into the sun, into the sun
When we finally get there, will we ever leave?
Will we find that all we have is all we really need?
All you gotta do is get there, miles above the ground
We can fade away without a sound
Oh, no, show me how to get away and go
Go, I don't want to do it on my own
So , find a way to get you all alone
We're going home
And we sail (Sail) into the sun (sun), into the sun
Sail (Sail) into the sun (sun), into the sun
When we sail (Sail) into the sun (sun), into the sun
Sail (Sail) into the sun (sun), into the sun

Someday
Im gonna rise up
Someday when I make my mind up
Nothing but goods gonna come from my love
Not until Ive paid my dues
When its dark out, Im gonna light a spark,
gonna hold my breath until the morning

Saw you on the tv
But that's not how I remember
Know that you can't see me in there
Tell me about the big screen
Is it what you remember
Did you want to mean something back there
You're so beautiful
You're still so beautiful
And you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it after all
Was it all how you had dreamed
Cause I was so much younger
Tell me what you're feelin' in there
You're so beautiful
You're still so beautiful
And you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it afterall
Did they hurt you
Was it worth it afterall
Worth it after all
Saw you on TV
But that's not what I remember
Wonder what you're feelin' in there

When the rest of the world is asleep
Do you remember that night when you and me
Pulled down the steeple of ash
The rain was coming down, I was filthy and black?
Sometimes I feel that my time
On earth is sorta defined
And my life, oh, it's calling me
And my life, oh, it's calling me
And I wonder what else it could be
There are times when I see and don't see
Sometimes I feel that I'm changed
By those women on the hill in the rain
In this vision of earthly decay
I see that time will bear us all away
But I'm sad I won't be here to see it fade
And my life, oh, it's calling me
And my life, oh, it's calling me
And my life, oh, it's calling me

I don't feel alright
In spite of these comforting sounds
You make
I don't feel alright
Because you make promises
That you break
Into your house
Why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
It's hard to make sense
Feels as if I'm sensing you
Through a lens
If someone else comes
I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Previously I never called it solitude
And probably you know
All the dirty shows I've put on
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Honestly I tried to avoid it
Honestly
Back when we were kids
We would always know when to stop
And now all the good kids are
Messing up
Nobody has gained or
Accomplished anything

When I think of fates worse than death
All I can think of is something you said
You said we were golden, bright like the sun
And now I am stranded
Knowing I'm not the one
An ocean of anger
Flowing through me
Blood stained and broken
From when I fell to sea
And just like a snake charmer
You led me astray
Living in distress
Hoping help is on the way
In the midst of a storm
Searching for shelter
I came upon
One single feather
A half-hearted wish
For something better
Gracefully cursed, I thirst
Attached to the soil
I'm guiding the wool
As I am in my blood
Yet so venerable
But after I'm gone
Once I finally leave
You will be left alone
To the wolves and the thieves

Look Out David Hopkins
Verse 1
Heres to the words, heres to the songs
Heres to my troubles, if I got it all wrong
Heres to what is and what cant be undone
Heres to the one to who wrote heres to the sun
And above all else and above all this
Heres to the one who just said it how it is
It was you.
Chorus
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Coming.
Verse 2
Ive been an angel, Ive been a fool
Ive been something and nothing
I dont follow any rules
Get so down on myself, I go looking for help
I go round cold places, I dont see nothing else
Lets not go talking about things that Ive done
Its not how it is, its just how its spun
And Ive got you.
Chorus
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Coming.
Bridge
Your eyes, were right where I am living
Your Hands, hold the future
My heart, is wide open
Chorus
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Look out babe youve got a lot of love
Coming.

They call her smokey taboo
I got your name tattooed
High like a helium balloon
Midnight to noon
I'm a desert child
And mountains make me nauseous
I like to look up wild at an infinite sky
Twinkling with diamonds
It's true I get depressed in fancy hotel rooms
Undressed with nothing to flaunt but my loneliness
Thinking of the night song of your hair
Premature as evening falls it calls to me
Interrupted by the sirens in the street
Cristal heaven, cristal heaven
Cristal heaven, cristal heaven
Somedays you're like an anchor on my heart
They say that stolen water tastes sweet
More like rotten milk and rancid meat to me
I prefers when it is free
Like looking at the stars
Don't need no fancy cars
When we first
Our kisses sparked
Yeah I'm afraid of sharks
But not the dark

Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
See, I left my home
I couldn't get used to living alone
Put me to rest
Lay your head on my chest
Hold my hand when you leave
Don't wake me up
Just to see how you say goodbye
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
God, I waited so long
Maybe my time has come
To walk by your side
Please put me at ease
Now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lover's curse
Now I am ready for you
My rebel, my hope
Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
God, I waited so long
Maybe my time has come
To walk by your side
Maybe I could be yours
(Maybe I could be yours)
Maybe you could be mine
Maybe I could be yours
God, I waited so long
To walk by your side
God, I waited so long
To walk by your side

You can leave this house, leave this town.
Leave it all to me, or you'll never leave the ground.
Look at that tiny screen's too small for you.
I think you should learn to dream, just like the dreamers do.
What can you do with a day?
What will you wake up and see?
The farther you get, the closer to me.
Am I the habit you're too tired to break?
I want you to love me with every step you take.
What can you do with a day?
What will you wake up and see?
The farther you get, the closer to me.
Taj Mahal, Cameroon, back in time,
To the moon, frozen lake, cypress trees,
Florida's missing keys, El Dorado,
Spain or bust, Eiffel Tower, Paris, just find your way in.
You should leave this house, leave this town,
All that's left to chart is nothing less than your own heart.
What can you do with a day?
What will you wake up and see?
The farther you get, the closer to me.
Down the river, down the road,
Little Rock, Tokyo, dusty trail,
Flagstaff, in a faded photograph, Thunderstorm,
Golden Sands, Cape of Horn, Pakistan, Surinam, Highway One,
Chinatown, smoking gun. Golden Gate, Baltic Sea,
Painted Desert, Laramie, Taj Mahal, Cameroon,
Back in time, to the moon, frozen lake, cypress trees,
Florida's missing keys, El Dorado, Spain or bust,
Eiffel Tower, Paris, just find your way in.

I think I'd like to go back home
And take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know
Living there
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day
Running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows
Every time I think about back home
It's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now
Passing time
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day
Running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows
I think I'd like to go back home
And take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know
Living there
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day
Running around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows
repeat until ending

You can leave me
On the corner
Where you found me
I'm not for sale anymore

Her mouth, it was moving
but no sound was coming out
and your back, it was turning
around
and we were always dreaming of the day that would never come
Los Angeles
I'm burning up for you
Hangin' out the window, holding on to an afternoon
She new how to teach them boys to fight
And we were always yelling at the night, who would never come
Was it desire?
You and I were never one.
Los Angeles
I'm burning up for you
When you would walk down the streets and you say goodbye
All along the river tonight

we could've went to heaven
what d'you mean you played
now I'm somewhere else, out of space
i'm staring in the mirror
i broke the fucking glass
now i'm somewhere else
living in the past
we would travel alone
Be away from you with the leaving faith
as I falling trough ???
I would see you there
We could start again as a love affair
but just friend
Whoooa
whooa
Until next time. x4
They say it's never over
they say it's neither fair
I don't know that's true
I don't even care
Cause I am focused on my future
I settle all the past
I done changed some things girl
Since you've seen me last
we would travel alone
Be away with you with the leaving faith
as I m falling trough??
I would see you there
We could start again as a love affair
but just friend
Whoooa
whooa
Until next time. x4

So now the years are rolling by,
And it's not long since you and I could have been
Train drivers and astronauts.
And now we're stuck in furnished ruts,
But yet the thing that really cuts
Is that we can't remember how we got caught.
Filtered air, computer screens,
Muffled sighs and might-have-beens
Count your blessings, then breathe,
And count to ten.
And though it doesn't often show,
We are scared because we know
Our forefathers were farmers and fishermen.
And so the world has changed,
Worse or better's hard to tell,
But my hope remains within the arms of Isabel.
So now our calloused hands once told
A story honest as it's old of sowing seeds
And setting sail.
But now our hands are soft and weak
And working seven days a week
At these salvation schemes that are bound to fail.
And so the world has changed,
Worse or better's hard to tell,
But my hope remains within the arms of Isabel.
And I'll admit that I am scared
Of what I don't understand.
But darling, if you're there,
Gentle voice and soothing hands,
To quiet my despair,
To shore up all my plans,
Darling, if you're there
And so the world has changed,
And I must change as well.
The machines we've made will damn us into hell.
And the time will come when all must save themselves.
I will save my soul in the arms of Isabel.

Can't do my homework, can't concentrate
It's ruining my grades, I can't think straight
Can't do my homework, it's all too late
It's ruining my brains, I can't sleep
We stay up way too late to pay
Our dues, I told you
Swollen eyes and tired tongues
Where have your clothes gone, why are you late
When you're not around, I suffocate
When all is hopeless, when all else fails
You've ruined my ending, It's ruined
I know there's not much you can count on
So always count on me
You know there's not much you cannot touch
So hold me, don't scold me
Don't hate my guts, it's not my fault
Don't hate my guts, it's not my fault you're gone
Can't do my homework, can't concentrate
It's ruining my grades, I can't think straight
Can't do my homework, can't concentrate
It's ruining my grades, I can't think straight

I dragged that horse to water,
you know he wouldn't drink.
I shot him in the shallows
before i had the time to think.
Now I'm out here on foot,
still gotta cross the great divide.
I'm feeling awful lonesome,
wishing i still had a horse to ride.
Come on, now.
My daddy always told me not to play around with matches,
got me a hold of a flame thrower, how that fire catches.
Wouldn't you know it,
me and daddy and mama didn't have nowhere left to live.
I was quick to remind daddy though
Jesus preached we all should just forgive forgive forgive.
They took me to the river to get my spirit clean,
wouldn't you know it buddy like nothing you'd ever seen.
That river spit me out,
and threw my bare ass right there up against the shore.
I swear it started raining blood, and the thunder start to roar,
preacher screamed, that boy got the devil in him lets burn him at the stake.
My mama jumped in front of me and told them all to wait,
she said my baby got the devil in him,
oh, he got the good Lord in him too.
She said my baby never hurt a fly,
but look what y'all was about to do, mama said now.
I dragged that horse to water,
that bastard wouldn't drink so
I shot him in the shallows
before I had the time to think.
Now I'm out here on foot,
still gotta cross the great divide.
Feeling awful lonesome wishing
I still had that horse to ride -
Now that I'm a grown man not as young as I once were,
reckon in my growing that i found myself a cure.
Settle down, take your time,
and try not to get caught up in all that haste,
but I reckon if it ever came to blows
I'd still lay some fool to waste.

It's been a long time,
since I left you there
I still feel the cold hands in mine
and there were good times we will leave them there
course the warmth of these hands of mine
I said let don't go
I said let don't go
We were always on the run
we waited for this moment just communicate
We took this all for granted
should we leave this where we walked
..just communicate
now there were good times,
we just left them there
would have felt your hand slip from mine
It's been a long time coming
should we leave it there
or prove that we could fight
we were always on the run
we waited for this moment
just communicate
we took this all for granted
should we leave it where we walked
please communicate
I said let don't go
I said let don't go
I said let don't go
We were always on the run
we waited for this moment
just communicate
We took this all for granted
should we leave this where we walked
..please communicate
We were always on the run
we waited for this moment it will be okay
We took this all for grantet
should we leave this where we walked
..please communicate
..please communicate
I should let you go, you should let me now
I should let you go, you should let me now
I should let you go, you should let me now

We might kiss when we are alone
Nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate
So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've know
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?
We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate
So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've know
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?

I was lost but your fool
Was a long visit wrong?
Say you are the only
So many foreign worlds
(So relatively fucked)
So ready for us
So ready for us,
The creature fear
I was teased by your blouse
Spit out by your mouth
I was loud by your lowered
Seminary sold
Tear on tail on
Take all on the wind on
The soft bloody nose
Sign another floor
The so many territories
Ready to reform
Don't let it form us
Don't let it form us
The creature fear
So did he foil is 'own?
Is he ready to reform?
So many torahs
So many for us
The creature fear

Brothers and sisters, have you heard the news?
The storm has lifted and there's nothing to lose,
So swap your confirmation for your dancing shoes,
Because there never was no God.
Step out of the darkness and onto the streets,
Forget about the fast, let's have a carnival feast,
Raise up your lowered head and hear the liberation beat,
Because there never was no God.
There is no God,
So clap your hands together,
There is no God,
No heaven and no hell.
But there is no God,
We're all in this together,
There is no God,
So ring that victory bell.
No cowering in the dark before these overbearing priests,
Not waiting until we die until we restitute the meek,
No blaming all our failings on imaginary beasts,
Because there never was no God.
No fighting over land your distant fathers told you of,
Not spilling blood for those who have never spread a drop of love,
No finger pointing justified by phantoms up above,
Because there never was no God.
There is no God,
So clap your hands together,
There is no God,
No heaven and no hell.
There is no God,
We're all in this together,
There is no God,
So ring that victory bell.
I know you're scared of dying man and I am too,
But just pretending it's not happening isn't gonna see us through,
If we accept that there's an end game and we haven't got much time,
Then in the here and now then we can try and do things right.
We'd be our own Salvation Army and together we'd believe
In all the wondrous things mere mortals can achieve
Well I've known beauty in the stillness of cathedrals in the day,
I've sung 'Glory Hallelujah' won't wash my sins away?
But now I'm singing my refrain and this is what I say,
I say there never was no God.
There is no God,
So clap your hands together,
There is no God,
No heaven and no hell.
But there is no God,
We're all in this together,
There is no God,
So ring that victory bell.
There is no God,
So clap your hands together,
There is no God,
No heaven and no hell.
There is no God,
We're all in this together,
There is no God,
So ring that victory bell.

Neon black tanks grope the skyline.
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine.
Neon black flowers on the mass grave.
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon.
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
While Devastator sips from the crystal chalice.
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
Culture and opulence.
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside.
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets.
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine."
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along.
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song:
"Everybody needs a little Devastation!"
Neon black dirt in the garden.
All the roses blossom into skulls this season.
Neon black branches hanging from the trees.
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories.
The fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises.
Devastator violates with dirty fingers.
Neon black flames cook the calm air.
The party's over, what was your favorite gift?
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode.

Long ago, before the left and right stereo,
There was a princess, and a dragon.
And, well the princess had no idea the dragon was a dragon.
But, all the while they were pen pals.
Uhm, they you know.. the princess didn't know the dragon was a dragon,
because the dragon had really good penmanship.
So, written on a scroll, a little torn around the edges with India ink,
here we go!
You are a princess, and we are pen pals
I am a dragon, but you don't need to know that
I've been working on my penmanship
I've been working on my penmanship
By this lantern lit, so this love won't quit
I am a dragon, and I catapult my love,
Over the castle wall
I've gotta tell you something,
that I've, never told anyone
I am a dragon,
I am a dragon, go on,
Well how can I
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
So they gather around my cavern,
Spears and torches, and they sing,
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
So far away, up in the kingdom
I can hear the queen, sing
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
How do you stop loving someone?
Let these words speak
let our eyes never meet
Cause even if you love me
What would the people think
What would they do to you?
They'll just keep fighting
and I'll keep writing, to you.
Even though I fly through the smoke,
doesn't mean I made the flare
I might have fire in my throat,
doesn't mean I made the flare.
I startled you,
You surprised me.
Just knowing you, has made me feel like I can sing.

I've been jumping through red lights
I've been on your tail all night
Temperatures are all rising, baby, oh
Yesterdays on the horizon, baby, oh
You are one mean human being
We're manufactured from the same machine
But I know where you go to recharge, baby, oh
Yeah, you're a sucker for a guy on guitar, baby, oh
You can't ignore
You know I know you more than anybody else
I can't forget you
We know each other better than we know ourselves
Now's the time to give it up
Let yourself fall deep in love
No one loves surprises, baby, oh
The futures littered with prizes, baby, oh
You can't ignore
You know I know you more than anybody else
I can't forget you
We know each other better than we know ourselves
Ain't it sad?
Ain't it love?
We spend our lives inside the hearts of those we barely know
Ain't it sad?
Ain't it love?
We spend our lifetimes looking for what's underneath our nose
(Repeat chorus)

Put me in your suitcase
Let me help you pack
'Cause you're never coming back
No, you're never coming back
Cook me in your breakfast
And put me on your plate
'Cause you know I taste great
Yeah, you know I taste great
At the hop, it's greaseball heaven
With candy pants and Archie too
Put me in your dry dream
Or put me in your wet
If you haven't yet
No, if you haven't yet
Light me with your candle
And watch the flames grow high
No, it doesn't have to try
It doesn't have to try
Well, I won't stop all of my pretending
That you'll come home
You'll be coming home someday soon
Put me in your blue skies
Or put me in your grey
There's gotta be some way
There's gotta be some way
Put me in your tongue tie
Make it hard to say
That you ain't gonna stay
That you ain't gonna stay
Wrap me in your marrow
Stuff me in your bones
Sing a mending moan
A song to bring you home

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
It would fall upon us all
And between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
And maybe I'll work out
A way to make it back some day
Towards you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
It would fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time
If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go

It ain't about a heart you find
It's about the one you sight
It's about the love you hide
It's waitin' to be let outside
And it ain't about losing yer mind
But if you happen to, that's fine
But theres only one way to shine
And it's called trying to live
Freely, freely meu coracao
Freely, freely meu coracao
I'd like to live that way
I'd like to live that way
And my mother may not understand
Why I'm the way that I am
But I love her and I wanna let her in (do you love her?)*
Get to know a friend
And now we gotta take some time
Get to know each other our whole lives
And I call on you to remind
Nothing's really mine
Except for
Freedom, freedom en meu coracao
Freedom, freedom en meu coracao
I'd like to live that way
Oh I'd wanna stay stay that way
Ya ever seen anything as kind
As the wind blowing by?
I've never seen anything as wise
As the sun rise that shines
Freely, freely en meu coracao
Freely, freely meu coracao
I'd like to live that way
I'd wanna live that way

Crawfish
Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole
Crawfish
See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look, fresh and ready to cook
Crawfish
Now take Mr. Crawfish in your hand
He's gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
He'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
Crawfish

Slow down the light's green
Speed up the mysteries
The ghost of your masterpiece
Breathes now like the trees
Begging please
'Cause if you feel love in the city tonight
Wont you breathe in 'cause you know it's alright
Feeling sober with all of us on your mind
Day train has beens
Daisy chains on the silver screen
The bloodshot limousine
Gold mine entities
Begging please
'Cause if you feel love in the city tonight
Wont you breathe in 'cause you know it's alright
Feeling sober with all of us on your mind
On your mind all of us on your mind
All of us on your mind
Feels like a film with your love in black and white
Sunday through Monday the radio star wont run away
'Cause if you feel love in the city tonight
Wont you breathe in 'cause you know it's alright
Feeling sober with all of us on your mind
All of us on your mind all of us on your mind

I got the highest heels on the street
But the don't get me high as I wanna be
I was born in summer sound
When all the New York city held it's breath
Scared to death
A regular boy in a Reagan time
With my BB gun and satellite
And boy did I want my MTV
And everything was easy
So easy it was easy
My oh my oh my we had promises too keep
I say my oh my oh my
Many miles to get to union street
If we could just get to union street everything would be alright
You were the prettiest girl in town
But your mum was a drug age kicked you around
And everyone new the word on the street
Knew she was easy oh so easy
Your ma' was easy
So meet me there in the parking lot
In that part of town that Jesus forgot
And bring those pills you stole from your ma'
We'll be here, we'll be here and we'll be gone, we'll be long gone
My oh my oh my we had promises too keep
I say my oh my oh my
Can you tell me the way to get to union street
If we could just get to union street
My oh my oh my we all have promises too keep
In the days of falling sky
With every house lit up on union street
If we can make it to union street
I say my oh my oh my
Its such along long way to go
And nobody gets out alive
But just as long as we got rock and roll
Then everything will be alright
It will be alright

My father was a story
My mother was afraid
They didn't mean to make me
But I got made anyway
Since I was a young child (wa-oh)
I much preferred the rain (wa-oh)
They asked me "Are you happy?" (wa-oh)
I said "I can't explain" (wa-oh)
And I say Heatstroke yellow, maybe strawberry blue
The strongest thing I ever felt was feelings for you
So try to look me in the eye
A difficult goodbye
To all the things we hide, ah-oh
I live my life upon a crystal shield
It's unbelievable but I keep believing
I'll never give up 'til the day I die
I'll never give up till the day I die I say
Every single time they come back home from the road
I say tell me where you've been to
Tell me what you've gone for
They tell me On the road you end up losing you soul
I'm thinking when they made me they forgot one of those
I say rich kids singing of the silver spoon blues
They tell me I can't get in 'cause there's just no more room
But they lied
They looked me in the eye
Scared of what they'd find
Underneath my side, ah-oh
And I hope you're right so I can see the sunshine
And I hope you're right 'cause I don't like this way
And I hope you're right so I can change the future
'Cause I was only hiding in the rain, wa-oh
Since I was a young child
I've seen a lot of rain
You asked me "Are you happy?"
I said "I can't explain"
I told you "I'm a monster" wa-oh
And I can't seem to feel, wa-oh
They asked me "Are you happy?" wa-oh
Said "No but I am real"
And I say Heatstroke yellow, maybe strawberry blue
The strongest thing I ever felt was feelings for you
So try to look me in the eye
A difficult goodbye
To all the things we hide, ah-oh
Rich kid singing of the silver spoon blues
They tell you you can't get in 'cause there's just no more room
But they lie
They look you in the eye
Scared of what they'd find
Underneath your side

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand.
And I come here to talk.
I hope you understand.
That green eyes
Yeah the spotlight
Shines upon you.
And how could anybody deny you?
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter now I met you.
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you.
Green eyes
Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float.
And I came here to talk.
I think you should know.
That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find.
And anyone who tried to deny you must be out of their mind.
'Cause I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you.
Honey you should know
That I could never go on without you.
Green eyes, green eyes
oh oh oh,
oh oh oh,
oh oh oh,
oh oh oh
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand.

Well I guess I should confess that I am starting to get old
All the latest music fads all passed me by and left me cold
All the kids are talking slang I won't pretend to understand
All my friends are getting married, mortagages and pension plans
And it's obvious my angry adolescent days are done
And I'm happy and I'm settled in the person I've become
But that doesn't mean I'm settled up and sitting out the game
Time may change a lot but some things may stay the same
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I yeah I won't grow up
Oh maturity's a wrapped up package deal so it seems
And ditching teenage fantasy means ditching all your dreams
All your friends and peers and family solemnly tell you you will
Have to grow up be an adult yeah be bored and unfulfilled
Oh when no ones yet explained to me exactly what's so great
About slaving 50 years away on something that you hate
Look I'm meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity
Well if that's your road then take it but it's not the road for me
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I yeah I won't grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And if all you ever do with your life
Is photosynthesize
Then you deserve every hour of these sleepless nights
That you waste wondering when you're gonna die
Now I'll play and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin
Now I'll play and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all yeah I won't grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up

I'm not afraid of falling, I just don't wanna hit the ground
I'm not afraid to lie and I just don't wanna tell the truth no more
I'm only human cause the people only telling me I'm so
Damn disrespectful of the future, but the present's too slow
Because the hand that feeds won't come today
There's only one chance left and it's fading away
It's a dangerous game, so won't you come and play
Yeah I am a lover, a ball in chains
Look best and ... and make up my face
I am a dreamer, I'm thinking about
I am a chaser, but I'm running away
I'll take survivors but the rest have to stay
Because there's nothing left, left for us to do
Left for us to do
I'm not afraid of falling, I just don't wanna hit the ground
It's complicated but sometimes I'm clearly blinded by the sound
The same confusion now ...making much more sense
I'm trying not to be sincere when all I do is cause offense
Because the hand that feeds won't come today
There's only one chance left and it's fading away
It's a dangerous game, so won't you come and play
Yeah I am a lover, a ball in chains
Look best and ... and make up my face
I am a dreamer, I'm thinking about
I am a chaser, but I'm running away
I'll take survivors but the rest have to stay
Because there's nothing left, left for us to do
Left for us to do
Because the hand that feeds won't come today
There's only one chance left and it's fading away
It's a dangerous game, so won't you come and play
Yeah I am a lover, a ball in chains
Look best and ... and make up my face
I am a dreamer, I'm thinking about
I am a chaser, but I'm running away
I'll take survivors but the rest have to stay
Because there's nothing left, left for us to do
Left for us to do

Always hungry, I've waited so long to feel your touch
You _____ me, ______ me,
do my bones show enough for your love?
Do what you want, I want you to
The only thing you have to do
So come and find me dizzy with the spell of our chemistry,
You are a diamond, that fits into my heart so easily
We have the system for the stars,
To keep us safe and warm
Do what you want, I want you to
Thee only thing you have to do
Follow the heart you know is true
Thee only thing, you have to do

You need not to climb mountaintops
You need not to cross the sea
You need not to find a cure
For everything that makes you weak
You need not to reach for the stars
When life becomes so dark
And when the wind
Does blow against the grain
You must follow your heart
You must follow your heart
When all your friends have come and gone
And the sun no longer shines
And the happiness for which you long
Is washed away like an ocean's tide
When all the hard times
Outweigh the good
And all your words are misunderstood
When the day seems lost from the stars
You must follow your heart
You must follow your heart
If you feel you've paid the price
And your wounds should cease to heal
And everything you love in life
Spins like a winding wheel
If you should wake to find you're abandoned
And the road you've traveled
Leads to a dead end
When death creeps in to play it's part
You must follow your heart
You must follow your heart

Your days in one
This day undone
(The kind that breaks under)
All day at once
(for me, for you)
I'm just too young
(And what of my heart)
This day was once
(Silence before)
All grace of lost
Can't wait at all
(Can't wait at all)
Temptation won
And what ever comes through the door
I'll see it face to face
All by your place
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
Sign me up Santa Fe
On the cross Santa Fe
And all I want
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
And I and I and I alone want you to know
And I and I and I alone
And I and I and I alone want you to know
And I and I and I alone
Your days in one
This day undone
(The kind that breaks under)
All day at once
(for me, for you)
I'm just too young
(And what of my heart)
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
Sign me up Santa Fe
On the cross Santa Fe
And all I want
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son

I got 36-foot insulation in my house
Wear 14 pairs of long underwear
Stick tape inside my ears
Cover myself with five bedspreads
I spend every morning in an isolation tank
Spend every afternoon high up in a tree
Spend every evening with one of those things over my eyes
Like in virtual reality
I'll never fall in love again
I got a walkman on my head every step I take
Put Thorazine in my morning coffee break
Won't feed the birds bread boys, let them eat cake
I'll lock my doors, click click click bang bang
When I'm not awake
When I'm walking down the street
Don't make me meet your sister, Pete
When there's a knock knockin' at my door
I'll just sit here on the floor
I'll run 26 miles a day straight up hills
Work overtime to pay all of my hospital bills
I'll spray black spray paint on my windowsills
I'll make a million dollars leave you outta my will
I'll never fall in love again

Staring at pictures hung up on the wall
Capturing moments when you had it all
It used to be easy, you were never in doubt
Life of the party, so in with the crowd
But right now
When you see her with somebody else
Are you bitter?
Just a thought, that she's moving with nothing at all
Are you bitter? Are you bitter?
Tear down a portrait of the little girl lost
You took her and built up a great debutant
The life that you gave her
She's living without you
The doors that you opened
She's closing them up
And right now
When you see her with somebody else
Are you bitter?
Just a thought, that she's moving with nothing at all
Are you bitter? Are you bitter?
We were shocked by the news
But we read every word, even the rumors
What are you gonna do?
As you fallen from grace, it's such a long way
It's such a hard way
To lose
And right now
When you see her with somebody else
Are you bitter?
Just a thought, that she's moving with nothing at all
Are you bitter? Are you bitter?

Bowie's in space
Bowie's in spa-a-hace
Whatcha' doin' out there, man?
That's pretty freaky, Bowie
What's a rock musician doing out in space,man?
Isn't it cold out there, Bowie?
You can borrow my Jumper if you want Bowie?
Does the space cold do funny things to your nipples
Making them all pointy, Bowie?
And do you use your pointy nipples as telescopic antennae
Transmitting data back to Earth?
(Data back to Earth)
Bet you do, you freaky old bastard, you.
Is it lonely out there in space, man?
Or is there life on Mars?
Wouldn't that be weird 'cause you wrote that song, "Is There Life on Mars"
You could write a follow up tune and call it 'And There Is'
Yes, there is, there is
Do you have one really freaky sequin space suit, man?
Or do you have several ch-ch-ch-ch-changes?
Do you smoke grass out in space, man?
Or do they smoke astro-turf?
Receiving transmission from David Bowie's nipple antennae
Do you read me, Lieutenant Bowie?
This is Bowie to Bowie,
Do you hear me out there, man?
This is Bowie back to Bowie,
I read you loud and clear, man
Oh yeah man!
Your signal's weak on my radar screen,
How far out are you, man?
I'm pretty far out
That's pretty far out, man!
I'm orbiting Pluto
I'm drawn in by it's Groovitational
(Groovitational pull)
I'm jamming out with the Mick Jagger-nauts
And they think it's pretty cool man
Are you OK, Bowie, what was that sound?
I don't know, man, I have to turn my ship around
Oh, it's the craziest scene
I know, I'm picking it up on my LSD screen
Can you see the Stratosphere ringing?
To the choir of Afro-nauts singing
bowie is in space
bowie [Repeat x6]
bowie is in space
bowie [Repeat x6]
Eenie, ma-ma-meenie mynie mowie
(Set your phasers on funky)
Eenie, ma-ma-ma-meenie mynie mowie
Eenie, ma-meenie, mynie mynie mowie
Bowie's in space

My dad's a miracle and so's my mom.
They fly over the blue.
They finish their dinner and then they take one another's hand.
And off they go to find a broader point of view.
For it's a give and take beyond the ordinary.
What with all the cats and kid's that they've loved.
And they will not be alone.
My friends give me purple flowers and orange tea
On goosedown spilling quilts and turquoise chairs
We greet each other in a wild profusion of words
And wave farewell amidst the wonderment of air
And in the laughing times we know that we are lucky
And in the quiet times we know that we are blessed
And we will not be alone
Well, the light that stopped the night felt like forgiveness to you
As the garbage trucks came bustling through their rounds
You stared at the pictures on your wall and all the postcards from your friends
As you heard the birds and old familiar sounds
An that's when you knew this world can't be saved, only discovered
And you knew things could be different than before
And you will not be alone anymore

When you think you've found something worth holding on to
Were you reaching for attention, hoping she would notice you
Collecting bottles and thrown-away cans
Like she was returnable
One day would refill your hands
How she loved you, all you imagined
Fit so well into your plans
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through the troubled times
Pining away every hour in your room
Rolling with the motion, waiting til it's opportune
Sitting there watching time fly past you
Why do tomorrow
What you could never do
How she loved you
All you imagined
Everything you put her through
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through the troubled times
And it takes a lot of nerve to ask how she is doing
Start with a weak foundation, you will end in ruins
The ways the days and hours pass you'll never understand
Falling like rain through your hands
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through the troubled times

Cold, cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Love one's daughter
Allow me that
And I can't let go of your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?

It's nothing they say
She bangs away
How long will she play
And push us away
We have no idea
Of her secret
Suffering so we
Have no idea
Of all the things she needs
Should've been clearer
Should've been clearer
Should've been clearer
"It's such a shame"
I know that's what everybodys saying
They suppose she's to blame
For all the abuse she's been taking
While waiting alone
She's just a child at the station
They miss her at home
There must be some explanation
'cause it should've clearer
It should've been clearer
It should've been clearer
Oh yeah
Should've been clearer
It should've been clearer
It should've been clearer

The biggest lie I ever told was when I said
"I don't love you no more"
The biggest fake you'll ever know
Sometimes I feel it's everything I don't show
And I'm always thinking 'bout relationships
Wanna let the rhythm flow and feel the bassline slip.
Leaving all that fussing and a fighting to them crazy, crazy fools.
But it's time I told you something I think you should know.
All about why I ran away and why I let this go.
Guess I got tired of always feeling like my heart just broke.
Tired of missing you.
And I don't want to fight with you no more.
Really, how many times can we go to war?
Really, how many days do we have to waste,
Before we can see that we've both made mistakes?
And I'm over always feeling like some hypocrite,
Telling you things are ok when they don't feel like it.
But I'm not sure that once your heart gets broke the pieces fit
Together quite the same.
So if you don't mind just for a while
I'm a keep this mess
That I call a heart, cracked and bleeding in this chest.
Dear God I wish sometimes we had never met.
Still, I love you anyway.

I heard the name Josephine
It came to me in dream
And I don't usually set too much store by the things that these things might mean
It was spoken with seriousness
More of a whisper than a scream
Now, I'm waiting on this Josephine
To show herself to me
Could have been anyone
I imagined, I could be
I just needed somebody
To show me how to be
I could have been Napoleon
Could have been Beethoven
Could have been anyone, but uncomfortable me
So come on now Josephine, show yourself to me
So come on now Josephine give me what I need
I don't like to be needy but sometimes needs
Must, I can't stand being the person that I've been
I'm an impending car crash
I'm the first one on the scene
I'm a defeated commander
I'm a tone-deaf composer
I'm a strange name whispered in a dream
Could have been anyone
I imagined, I could be
I just needed somebody
To show me how to be
I could have been Napoleon
Could have been Beethoven
Could have been anyone, but uncomfortable me
So come on now Josephine, show yourself to me
So come on now Josephine
Let's pretend it's Halloween
You come as a car crash
And I'll go as James Dean
I'm Napoloeon on Elba
And you're a hundred days in 1815
I wrote all of these letters to my immortal beloved
You're the only one who's ever gonna know what they mean
Come on now Josephine
Show yourself to me
Could have been anyone
But I ended up being me
Could have been runaway
Could have been what you need
I wish that I was anyone except for just me
So come on now Josephine
Show yourself to me
Come on now Josephine
Show yourself to me
Come on now Josephine
Show yourself to me
Come on now Josephine
Show yourself to me

Lost in time
And loving in the dark
Who needs light
When we're among the stars
Lost in time
And loving in the dark
Who needs light
When we're among the stars
Lost in time
And loving in the dark
Who needs light
When we're among the stars

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold you love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

don't you think that we were beautiful?
don't you think that I'm your friend?
ill be the first one to tell you a lie
wait until i know who you are
waiting for a shot in the dark
nothing that you're used to, to.
once i told you bout my other friends
you let me be alone
ill be the first one to tell you a lie
wait until i know who you are
waiting for a shot in the dark
nothing that youre used to,to

Late at night in the basement
singing along, hoping for some magic
who knows what power's left in the words we sing to each other
who knows
stretch it out the invisible like parking tickets on the dash of the car
leave them one by one
The flags waving up on the vane
desperate measures, different minds
If we fall together they see me cry
Nothing can hold them, at least not tonight.
I know there's power left in the way we sing to each other
becalm the darkened room for I'm the funeral singer
fold back the visual like lenses focused on the light at the end
leave them one by one
The flags waving up on the vane
desperate measures, different plans
If we fall together they see me cry
Nothing can hold them, at least not tonight.

The giant swan's got ghosts in his wings.
His guts are stuffed with polaroids, and they're all humiliating.
And when the wine's drunk and the wild cabaret has sung it's last voice,
And you're sitting all alone in the 4am darkness of a pitch-black theater,
He explodes like fireworks on the stage with gold smoke.
Sing, your voice just won't stop blooming.
He wrote a play and you're the protagonist.
All the girls you wish you'd fucked make a guest appearance.
Oh, and you just won't believe the ending.
Fly me home, giant swan!
The giant swan's got a pixelated beak.
His eyes are twin mushroom clouds,
His feathers are unsuspecting cities,
And his breasts are hollow apartments with the highest quality furnishings.
And you can watch tv until you die there, deflated skin draped over luxury chairs.
Sing, your voice just won't stop blooming.
If your heart's a diamond, buddy, what's the price?
If your heart's a diamond what's the fucking price?
Your mouth is cheap and your hair is shoddy.
So sit and watch the ballerinas kick and spin.
Then strip down to your vulgar skeleton.
You'd better take one more drink of captain morgan's rum.
Oh, it's gonna sting like a raw sunrise when they black swan's gone.
Back at the resort, the curtains closed, you haven't left the room for two solid weeks.
With a pound of cocaine under the bed where the call girls perform their services.
And you have to leave CNN on so you don't think about her newborn son
Who entered this town from the crotch you're renting out.
"who's at the door? what the fuck!
Who's at the door? what the fuck!
Who's at the door? what the fuck!"
Your heart is sweating; your hands are turning black.
Your shadow breaks in wearing a ski mask.
Is that a machete at your throat?
"give me all your money! give me all the dope!"
And the sun's like a painting of your whole life.
You scratch at the canvas, but you can't get inside.
And the sun's like a painting of your whole life.
You scratch at the canvas, but you can't get inside.
Your family is gurgling grief.
You think you're fast asleep.
Is that the curtain closing?
Giant swan, take me to the river.
Is that my flesh corroding?
Giant swan, take me to the river.
All the things you wish you said are buried with your x'd out head.
All your ulterior motives...
Giant swan, take me to the river.

I feel so lonesome I could cry
But instead I'll pass the time
Sitting lonely with somebody lonely too
Well there's nothing in the world I'd rather do
Now tell me if you don't feel this way
But all I want, all I ever need
Is someone out there who believes
Sometimes believes
Not always believes
Sometimes believes
Now we don't have to take it to extremes
We'll keep our hands, our legs, even our lips apart
But I'm giving you my heart
My heart
Are you giving me your heart
Your heart
Are you lonely too
Are you lonely too
High-five
So am I
All of your life
Stuck inside
I'm stuck too
I'm stuck with you
Do you believe
I do
I do
I do

Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous.
Oh je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave.
Non laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça.
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

I held you in my arms just yesterday
When you lie you always touch your hair
When you tell me that he wasn't there
You called me when you woke up
And you stayed calm cause I choked up
And maybe we're both f*cked
Or maybe I'm just bad luck
So I'll make up my bed
Try to get high
Try to forget what you said
Then I call you again
Cause I can't sleep
I don't feel like I used to
And you don't look like you want to
And your skin crawls and my jaw clicks
It's not bad if you're used to it
Not broke if it can't be fixed
Not real if you question it
Not clean if we're still a mess
And we're still a mess
You got sick so you quit school
And we're dead broke but it fits you
And it's not like it won't get you too
I was just like you
So I make up my bed
Try to get clean
Try to forget you instead
Then I call you again
Cause I can't sleep

When I wake into the Morning Sun,
Well I feel another day has just begun.
I see those clouds up in the sky,
And I don't care, everything is going to be alright.
And I wan't you to know, some feelings come and go
But for you mine will never change.
It's harder than it seems to know what to believe,
Here in my mind I hold you close.
I got to keep on walking
With my head held high, because I see,
The sky on a day like
This, and I know, I will be free,
Oh I will be...free
Well I have never seen a face like yours,
It makes me smile just when I think of you for sure.
And all we have is all we have to show,
And all we need is here for free. Just thought I'd let you know.
And when I hold you close, it's you I love the most,
You take my loneliness away.
I saw you in my dreams and then you came to me.
Will you be mine?, I only hope.
I got to keep on walking
With my head held high, because I see,
The sky on a day like
This and I know, I will be free

o what is this feeling that we're feeling
that makes me feel so small
makes me feel like you don't
you don't need, don't need me at all
o and who am i to you
just a collection of expressions
old and angry sentiments
washed away washed away with time
where do you keep your ghosts
wrapped up in guards and tresses
secret and smoky pretensions
that say i need i need you.
o what is this feeling that we're feeling
that makes me feel so small
makes me feel like you don't
you don't need, don't need me at all

this is the point
where the eye and I don't meet
this is the point
that spells defeat
i have watched your unlove
written like tabloids
i had to stumble on buying my food
there you were
unfolded in headlines and horror
i love all those bits of you
i love all those bits of you
on the hardwood floor
where the bird imitates our fighting
you put the golf show on
to avoid my crying
you cup your arm to care
where the hurt went in
and well, why does it hurt?
complications of leftover racisms
why does it hurt?
you start the road trip off with accusations
of why does it
feel like i've been run over in traffic
scratchin in the dust of someone's leavin
punches in my gut
oh look i'm bleeding
not for you, for me this time, this time
not for you, for me
this time
just for the record, there is no record
it's a problem
there is no "this is what you said"
that's already gone
all we have are our love
and our guts baby
all we have are our love
and our guts baby
they're all over the road
you don't know the difference
between anger and pissed off
one is doing and one is feeling
one is doing and one is feeling
and i'm feeling
i'm feeling
feels like i've been run over in traffic
scratchin at the dust of someone's leaving
punches in my gut
oh look i'm bleeding
not for you, for me this time, this time
not for you, for me
this time
i need to be healed
i need to be healed
just saying it does it
just smashing it crushes it
just loving it douses it
just saying it does it
just smashing it crushes it
just loving it douses it
just loving it douses it
feels like i been run over in traffic
scratching at the dust of someone leaving
punches in my gut
oh look- i'm bleeding
not for you, for me this time, this time
not for you, for me.
not for you, for me.

well the radio was blasting another day old tune
my mother left me for a war, for an old dragoon
the streets were burnt , no one cried, no one made a sound
my friends waited by the wayside until the end of the day
the pipes burst in the road and soaked our way
we followed that path until we came to our home
well her diamonds twinkle fast, her time don't move
she can turn inside the evening
she's got nothing to prove
she comes, she comes to the light
no one was speaking except the sound of an alarm
it kept me up for an hour, lying in her arms
and she comforts me and tells me, "lay your head"

Can you imagine all the homes abandoned and all alone?
With no one left to care for them, wilting in moss.
The paint is peeling off the walls.
The corners are filling up with dust.
Cigarette smoke hangs in the air,
And the grass ain't growing like it did long ago.
Whether a natural disaster ripped it from it's foundation
Or an economic tragedy tore apart it's family
They're all empty.
The pipes have long since seized.
The windows are all boarded up.
There's no electricity flowing through these lifeless veins.
Cracks are running down the walls
Where picture frames used to hang.
A hint of heartbreak still lingers in the air,
And weeds have choked the breath out of it long ago.
Whether a natural disaster ripped it from it's foundation
Or an economic tragedy tore apart it's family
They're all empty.
They're all empty.

That boy take me away into the night
Out of the hum of the street lights and into a forest
I'll do whatever you say to me in the dark
Scared I'll be torn apart by a wolf in mask
Of a familiar name on a birthday card
Blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles
"You're too old to be so shy"
He says to me so I stay the night
Just a young heart confusing my mind
But we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene
Well, I have brittle bones it seems
I bite my tongue and I torch my dreams
Have a little voice to speak with
And a mind of thoughts and secrecy
Things cannot be reversed
We learn from the times that we are cursed
Things cannot be reversed
Learn from the ones we fear the worst
And learn from the ones we hate the most how to
Blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles
"You're too old to be so shy"
He says to me so I stay the night
Just a young heart confusing my mind
But we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed
'Cause we both know
I'll never be your lover
I only bring the heat
Company under cover
Filling space in your sheets
Well, I'll never be a lover
I only bring the heat
Company under cover
Filling space in your sheets
In your sheets
So, please just blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles
"You're too old to be so shy,"
He says to me so I stay the night
It's just a young heart confusing my mind
But we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene

I've no regrets,
time to forget
If your lookin' for some kind of a soul remedy,
take control of it
Its back again,
deep in my head
But somethin' tells me to make my move,
save my energy
[Bridge]
Is it really hurt,
that I feel
or is it just the thought of you that's killin' me?
I don't want to break it
and watch it melt away
[Chorus]
When I wake I feel the sun inside,
I know I'll be alright,
On the day it rained forever
All around the walls are breaking down
Nothing makes a sound,
On the day it rained forever
(Rained forever)
Were angels
watchin' the world,
But you can't stop the feeling
that nothing's real
It's a dream
So break free,
got to survive
A new day is dawning,
just wait for a morning star
[Bridge]
Is it really hurt,
that I feel
or is it just the thought of you that's killin' me?
I don't want to break it
and watch it melt away
[Chorus]
When I wake I feel the sun inside,
I know I'll be alright,
On the day it rained forever
All around the walls are breaking down
Nothing makes a sound,
On the day it rained forever

Through the night I will drive toward the city
Carry on to the edge of the morn
Should the daylight forgive awful things that I did
You might let me do more
Oh daffodil my petunia
Oh daffodil my rose
Find my two lips in the darkness
And let yours be my home
Let yours be my home

playing checkers in the greatest hall
made math and science school a little less not fun at all
studying all night for Dr. Kish's quiz
at least you never caught Yersinia pestis
LAN parties after lights out
some got mad when we competed for the longest shout
Suspended for a week when i propped a door
so we drove to Shawnee to get some tips from Rushmore
it was looking pretty bleak - would they let us stay?
But did we really want imprisonment anyway?
Still, I'm pretty glad they let us back in
You were a pretty shoddy roommate but I'd do it again
Don't ever take for granted what you're given
Mathew when they found you they had found you finding Jesus as well
the poison had caught you in its spell
did nobody bother you to tell
the Catholics would banish you to ...
well they should know that you're in
a better part of hell
Making fun of Tyler and Aaron for being so fat
and how Laura was such a brat
double-cut punch right across the chin
boxing during study time once and again
and with a couple old foils we'd find and then
party in the dark to Aphex Twin
Always kind of an ass, always making us laugh
i used to like looking into the past
now you're out of line, now you're out of time
forever asshole
did you really think you had it the worst of all?
you had everything you ever needed
except another head a little less conceited
forget about the ones that once you needed
Matthew when they found you they had found you finding Jesus as well
the poison had caught you in its spell
did nobody bother you to tell
the Catholics would banish you to
well they should know that you're in
a better part of hell
than the darkness whence you fell before
Matt when they found you they had found that you'd found Christ where
you lay
he gave you the strength to live, they say.
i think he gave you the strength to pass away
he made you believe it was okay
to produce all the pain and blame
anchors away!
five hundred yesterdays
before you took your breath away.
not a lot to say
nothing much to do
there is a part of you
in every of the ones you knew
one of whom forever blue
i only wish you knew
that the gun that failed to fire beforehand
tried to tell you nothing new

What Falls
What Falls On The Side
Of My Soul
What Falls
What Falls On The Side
Of My Soul

Seven Hours
Took a vacation/ State hospital
My sister came to pick me up/ Take the meds from a paper cup
The nurses they took me in/ They asked me where I was and who Id been
Took the laces from my shoes/ Cigarettes and my lighter
Seven hours ago.I was really close
Quick to tell you why they use/ some depressed and some abused
Some people shuffle down the hall/ waiting for that cattle (call)
Aint what you did or you didnt do/ Some things I have to keep away from you
Some nights I wish that I never left/ Its the first night I ever
Seven hours ago.I was really close

I can hear my train comin'
It's a lonesome and distant cry
I can hear my train comin'
Now I'm runnin' for my life
What makes a man
Walk away from his mind?
I think I know
I think I might know
I can feel the wind blowin'
It's sending shivers down my spine
I can feel the wind blowin'
Shakes the trees and the power lines
What makes a man
Spend his whole life in disguise?
I think I know
Think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, know
(What makes a man?)
I can see the sun settin'
It's casting shadows on the sea
I can see the sun, it's setting
It's getting colder, starting to freeze
What makes a man
Want to break a heart with ease?
I think I know
Think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, oh
(What makes a man?)
I can hear my train comin'
Looks like time is on my side
I can hear my train comin'
I'm still runnin' for my life
What makes a man pray
When he's about to die?
I think I know
I think I might know
(What makes a man?)
Think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, oh
(What makes a man?)
(What makes a man?)
Think I might know
(What makes a man?)
I think I might know, oh
(What makes a man?)

baby don't you know
that when the dark comes by
you will, don't deny
you will rip down peace and by
you're skin to mine realize
in thought of such sights fills me with blackness
you've been the saddest thing and the
baddest boy alive
hello again
i've not seen you round here before
and what's more is that's
where they go
people stop to point at the pauper's gates
but this is who we are
i've just been upstairs on the inside looking out through your
window
i see you standing there and it's everything that
you wish to know that is close
and I look sexy unless they cure me
well you're a bad gene and they won't let me try
but i've not seen you round here before
well i could sympathize with the simple folk with the moonstruck eyes
maybe I'm a lunatic too
but I like the stars and the moon
can see your fascinated too
maybe the lunatic's you maybe the lunatic's you
maybe maybe
maybe the lunatic's you

why all they want to do is go and get away

I think about the days when we were young
and care free
We never even bothered to ask
Who are we or Who we should be
We just exsisted with no resistance
We were superheroes then
But times have changed
and wars are raging
underneath our skin
We're dodging bullets and
holding ground
Pushing, pulling and weighing down
What happened to that cape I used to wear?
Is it out there?
Is it out there?
And if you find it somewhere inside of me
Help me find it because I should be flying
I wanna be a superhero again
And finish this war under my skin.
Oh but, History has shown us
that when times are gettin hard
It's time for us to grow and see exactly who we are
The morning after the storm
is always brighter than the rest
Right?
Especially when you know you past your test
But the tests are only standerized
In little public schools
were they've given you all the answers
and prepared you with the rules
I don't think life on earth is set up
quite the same
It's every man out for himself
Until we make things change
Can we make things change?
So give me one thing
Something please
Just a glimmer of hope
I'm on my knees
I need to know that I'm not
That I'm not crazy
And if I am
then tell me now so I can
Tie my cape to my straight jacket
and bow out
'cause I am not about to go down this way
No not the superhero
Today
I guess I'm not the superhero
Today

I don't want you to never ever leave your ways
I don't want your macho violent days
I don't want your push against my shoulder
I don't want your shit I thought I told ya
I don't want you to never ever leave your ways
Step on up
Step on up
And oh I ache
All this pain gonna scream my name
Chorus:
I can tell by the way you walk
By the way you talk it don't feel right
I can tell by the way you move
By the way you move it don't look right
Step on up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Step on up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Could've had much more but you threw it all away
I don't spend my time going crazy everyday
I don't need that shit I thought I told ya
Why don't you backfire it up or move over
Could've had much more but you threw it all away
And oh I ache
All this pain gonna scream my name
And oh your face
All this time you had no place
Chorus:
I can tell by the way you walk
By the way you talk I don't feel right
I can tell by the way you move
By the way you move it don't look right
Step on up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Step on up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is not for me
This is not for you
Take this hurt and hide it hide it
This is not for me
This is not for you
Take this hurt and hide it hide it
Chorus x2:
I can tell by the way you walk
By the way you talk I don't feel right
I can tell by the way you move
By the way you move it don't look right
Step on up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Step on up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Calling out to me this time
Coming up to see things too
I can See a change in you
Coming out to see it through
See the other side
The city is cold and full
Find another line
Steady as the old current
See the other side
The city isn't quiet anymore
Find another time
Already is a force with power
Falling out of time again
Falling on the calling by
I can feel a move in you
Calling out a feeling too
I feel like I know you
Let the tunes(?) come and go
I feel like I know you
Saturday's coming now

Take me off you test now
You know I passed with a 91
You're making a mistake how
Do you do this and call it fun
And if I had the chump change
I'd pay you off off and call this done
But there's something more here
and I know
Making up a story
I don't believe
Did you get my message
I tried to get you with my family
You're crashing out my head
You're taking off my head
And it's stuck, stuck in the ground
Stuck in the middle
Oh, and it's not nice
to define your way through a riddle
Yeah you're stuck, stuck in the ground
Stuck in the middle
Oh, and it's not nice
to define your way through a riddle
Well I gotta go
And point the wheel where it needs to be
But how am I going to get there
If I'm travelling to WeekiWachee
You're crashing out my head
You're taking off my head
And it's stuck, stuck in the ground
Stuck in the middle
Oh, and it's not nice
to define your way through a riddle
Yeah you're stuck, stuck in the ground
Stuck in the middle
Oh, and it's not nice
to define your way through a riddle
Your way through a riddle
Your way through a riddle
Your way through a riddle
Take it slow, you never could know
What's down the road

Breaking up in the station, a final train
I don't even know if I'll ever see you again
Is it a choice that we even have?
Bang, bang down on piano 'til I smash the keys
Living alone with the melodies
Everything's gone and I don't know where
And the rule of thumb don't apply anymore
'Cause the house is burning
I'm trying to pull myself away
I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape
I'm trying to pull myself away
Lately when I get lost there's this thing I know
Even the dogs have somewhere to go
Everything comes if you just let it be
Work, work, brighten the corners that'll never see
Untangle the thoughts that you know what they mean
I hope that the answer didn't come too late
And the rule of thumb don't apply on me
'Cause the tables are turning
I'm trying to pull myself away
I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape
I'm trying to pull myself away
Caught in a pattern and I can't escape, can't escape
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Trying to pull myself away
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Trying to pull myself away
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Everything's gone, everything's gone

All this time
And all is fine
Oh call me paranoid,
But I think something's going on.
I know you'd say
It looks ok
Yeah, but I've got my suspicions
But I don't want to be like this.
'Cause I'm a reasonable guy
But I can't shake this
And I don't know why.
Experience brings
A kind of sense for these things
So call me paranoid
But I think something's going on
'Cause it seems alright
Oh but it's too damn quiet
And I tell you I don't like it.
Oh God, I wish it isn't so.
'Cause I'm a reasonable guy,
But I can't shake this
And I don't know why.
Katie, will you say to me?
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong?
Katie, will you say to me?
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on?
Oh, for goodness sake
Now you know I'd hate to come over obsessive,
'Cause I'm really, really, really,
I'm not like that at all
Did I say too much?
Yeah well not as such
Oh look, but there I go again.
No this really is not how I am.
It's just there's something in my mind
That says where were you last nght?
Katie, will you say to me?
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong?
Katie, will you say to me?
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on?

She feels me up then she kicks me down
Chews her gum while humming a song
Has me for dinner in her dressing gown
Stark naked underneath I am
Feebly struggling and played along
I should get out but her hips are strong
I try to peek out of my blindfold
Cuffed, gagged and cheaply sold
But I know something that she'll pay to keep
A secret, we let ourselves back in the game
And so the dance goes on in a dirty style
We can provide no rest for the weary eye
It's far too late to apologize
And if you care to dance, not a chance
Stand in line
Wait up for miss Swedish Pie
Will I join her foul pigsty
of broken men trying to prophesy
her next move? While we can't move;
Stand in line
How many men have you done this to?
I suspect that we are quite a few
Sweet-talk us and bump us around
Bury us under miles of mound
But I know something that you'll pay to keep
A secret, but I can't get any leverage
And so the dance goes on in a dirty style
We can provide no rest for the weary eye
It's far too late to apologize
And if you care to dance, not a chance
Stand in line
Wait up for miss Swedish Pie
Will I join her foul pigsty
of broken men trying to prophesy
her next move? While we can't move;
Stand in line

Lovers kiss
The haunting eyes of the innocent
I Hold you close
In the sweet caress
Of your wedding dress
I lay you down
Lost in the sound
Of the temptress queen
She rules the world
Underneath my feet
I hold her close
Just to feel her need
Pray she'll never leave ,
She'll never see
Chorus:
All my senses are to blame
My dear
All my lovers effigies are burning but the one
All our mysteries are meant to be
The secrets of your heart forever yearning to belong.
To a lovers kiss.
A lovers kiss
Takes her out
To the infinite
Drags her down from the parapet
where there's no regret.
No regrets.

alright... come on... no-w-w-w-w
the main gate to the mansion is locked
it's on my street -- on my block
I went in but I got chased off
the store-keeper said 'why don't the cars stop?'
but the mansion's not the attraction it once was
and it's on my, it's on my, on my... on my block
on my block
girl I've been called names times before
it happens cause it happens here
and nobody said they'd ever hear
the garden is unkept and in bloom
there is wilderness and flowers in my room
the caretakers kept to be fired soon
on my block
girl I've been called names times before
it happens cause it happens here
and nobody said they'd ever hear
the maingate -- the mansion -- is locked
I'm standing on the spot
and it's on my, oh my my... on my block
on my block (fade)

Playground '95, here where you read me blind
Cowboys, pistols, and a Little Princess
Vain Hope to snatch a Piece of the pie
Though i claim a streak of your shine
I stick to my Guns
And I'm tired of proving you wrong
I further my sight
Sometimes in two minds
And everything falls into Place
Flip a coin and switch the line
You face away, stray thoughts remain
Playground '95, here with you by my side
Cowboys, pistols and a Little Princess
Just snatch a Piece, no Need to hide

We're buried beneath with mountains to climb
We're drowning away with water and wine
Were you watching the wolves, our very first kiss
Wipe the tears from your face, the taste from your lips
We'll sit in communion, our hands in our laps
Writing prayers for a God who will never pray back
We won't last for forever, make best with your time
We're the last of our fathers, the first of our kind
So no one believes me, it wasn't so easy to say
I offered the world to a heartbroken girl
and she left me and stole it away
This may sound ruthless, so honest and useless
but no one believes what I say
Oh I'll follow the birds,
'cause they're always there to chase
I'll sit here remembering what I have got left
The scars; the words that escape from my chest
Let the birds fly for winter to the heat of the south
I will die by the summer, I will die by myself
In the freshest of airs, the calmest of storms
With the blue lights approaching I'll lay in your arms
I will die like religion, I'm weak with my facts
But the people will wait, oh the birds will come back
So Father believe me, it wasn't so easy to say
I offered the world to a heartbroken girl
and she left me and stole it away
This may sound ruthless, so honest and useless
but no one believes what I say
Oh I'll follow the birds,
'cause they're always there to chase

Get off your catwalk, I want you to talk
To be the seer instead of the seen
There is a flower, a leaning tower
And all of the wonders standing between
I don't want to be another mystery, oh no
I don't want to see who's looking at me, oh no
I want to be the one to feel the sun, oh, oh
So if you want to see the world with me, let's go
The alligator, the god that made her
And all the creatures that got left behind
In Mycenaea, Ave Maria
And everything you gotta dig harder to find
I don't want to be a vapor of heavenly light
Everybody guess if I'm an angel or sprite
I don't want to be another mystery, oh no
I don't want to see who's looking at me, oh no
I want to be the one to feel the sun, oh, oh
So if you want to see the world with me, let's go
You could pursue it, hell I could do it
I'll just be quiet when I get angry and hurt
I'm stopping traffic, cinemagraphic
With my long black coat hanging down in the dirt
And my hair clinging to my face in the rain
Like a goddess from the cult of beautiful pain
I don't want to be another mystery
I don't want to be another mystery
I could cut you off with a shoulder of stone
Smoke all night and leave the party alone
Screw myself with an inscrutable pout
But I just want you to come figure me out
I don't want to be another mystery, oh no
I don't want to see who's looking at me, oh no
I want to be the one to feel the sun, oh, oh
So if you want to see the world with me, let's go
I don't want to be another mystery

Take me out to the garden
go and colour me blue
I feel new
I feel new
I feel so alive, so alive
Leave me here on the patio
let me know when you go
I feel good
I feel good
Like I should
oooh
So lay all the woes of the world inside
ooh aah
So lay all the weight of the day behind
ooh aah
aah
ba ba bada ba ba
ba ba bada ba ba
ba ba bada ba ba
ba ba bada ba ba
Take me out through the fire escape
Let me know when I'm free
I feel new
I feel new
I feel so alive, so alive
Leave me here on the patio
let me know when you go
I feel good
I feel good
Like I should
oooh
So lay all the woes of the world inside
ooh aah
So lay all the weight of the day behind
ooh aah
So take all the weight of the world
and shake all the weight of the world
and throw all the woes of the day away
ooh aah
aah

I can see the light coming
I can see the light coming
Over the hill, over the hill
Mmm mmmmm mmmm
Mmmm mmmmm mmmm
Hard Believer
Hard Believer
Won't you believe
won't you believe me now
Mmm mmmmm mmmm
Mmmm mmmmm mmmm
We were made for each other
won't you believe me now
We were made for each other
won't you believe me now
I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence
Golden like the new sun
Hard Believer
Hard Believer
Won't you believe me now

When I was just a little boy
I asked my father, "How would it be?
Would I be able to play in the trees?
Cause they're cutting down forrest
And spreading diseases"
And here's what he said to me:
"Que Sera Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
What will be, will be."
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart "What lies ahead?
Will there be rainbows, day after day?
Will we become just another clich?
Having it all yeah and thrown it away?"
Here's what my seetheart said:
"Que Sera Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
What will be, will be."
Now I have children of my own
They ask their father "What will we be?
Will we be bitter? Filled with regret?
Will we be choking on our own shit?"
I tell them tenderly:
"Que Sera Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
"Que Sera Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
"Que Sera Sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
What will be, will be.
Que Sera Sera"

My house is hard to find, but I'll give you directions
You can visit sometime, down where all that I built surrounds me
Just make sure your car's got good shocks
There's steep hills, there's potholes, there's rocks
I work in the garden, my son plays around me
Close the gate behind you, there's a horse that can't get out
I will see you first, is that all right
And can you remember, can you remember
This is not the house that pain built
This is not the house that pain built
I was drowning in something, I jumped in the rift
And you knew me back then, when I spat on my gift, but no
It's tough and it's tiring when you go it alone
I learned about wiring, I learned about stone
The building is done but the work's never through
And I won't give up, no how, it reminds me of who I am and where I am now
I remember myself, that's the work that I do
On a spring night when the snow is melting
You'll see two sets of footprints walking
Look at all the stars, and turn around, and walk home
Slowly walk home
This is not the house that pain built
That is not a house that pain built
My friends all think that I holed up and hid
But I tell them I didn't, you know I don't think I did, no

Five hours from now
You'll be sleeping
I'll be lying awake wondering
Did we make the right decision?
What a day
What a day we had
What a day
What a day we had
Brian and I decided
This year we'll make ourselves believe in everything
I don't know about you but I've had enough of trying to live through doubt and
What a day
What a day we had
What a day
What a day we had
What a day
What a day we had
What a way to go
What a day
What a day we had
What a day
What a day we had
What a day
What a day we had
What a way to go
What a way to go

Sing a song for the daughters of Magdalene
All tied up in their white ribbon.
November came and before I got your letter
I will love you better, I will love you true.
Everyday I would wait by the gates for you,
With time how your heart withdrew.
You said I never understand the pain or share the shame,
but you know that I want to.
But you give me hope and now you take it away,
You took my love and now you celebrate.
When the morning comes, no I don't believe
In my God, oh my God how could you take her from me?
So I told, and the sisters of mercy came
by your school just yesterday.
I never meant for to cause you any pain
I wanna make it better, make it go away.
So sing a song for the daughters of Magdalene,
all smothered neath the white ribbon.
If Mary knew how she was being used,
so misconstrued how you were being used.
But you give me hope and now you take it away,
You took my love and now you celebrate.
When the morning comes, no I don't believe
In my God, oh my God how could you take her from me?
You give me hope and now you take it away,
You took my love and now you celebrate.
When the morning comes, no I don't believe
In my God, oh my God how could you take her from me?

I went and lost my keys again,
so you let me sleep inside your bed,
i know it's hard to find a friend,
but you knew you hadn't let the right one in,
It's okay...i'm just a kid,
it's okay...i'll get over it.
All i wanna do is talk,
but seeing you fucks me up,
all i wanna do is talk,
but seeing you fucks me up,
All i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
Her flat morning
your arms holding
without warning
cold wind coming
I don't wanna hear about her
I don't wanna hear about her
I don't wanna hear about her
I don't wanna hear about her
All i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
All i wanna do is talk,
but seeing you fucks me up,
all i wanna do is talk,
but seeing you fucks me up,
All i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk
all i wanna do is talk

You never worship, you never worship your life
You never worship, you never worship your life
You never worship, you never worship your life
You never worship, you never worship your life
You never worship, you never worship your life
You never worship, you never worship your life
All the while you're standing still, you all reach in the past
You won't let the good times in, if you do, you make sure they won't last
Can't you see the lights they're shining to lead you back again?
My heartbeats can be a silver lining, just listen well to them
You never worship, you never worship your life
You never worship, you never worship your life
Never worship your life
All the while you're standing still, you all reach in the past
You won't let the good times in, if you do you make sure they won't last
Can't you see the lights they're shining to lead you back again?
My heartbeats can be a silver lining, just listen well to them
They will worship, they will worship your life
They will worship, they will worship your life
They will worship, they will worship your life
They will worship, they will worship your life
They will worship your life

If you had any idea what it was gonna take
Would you have gotten started in the first place
All these commitments you've made
They keep on adding up
Because you got addicted from the first taste
Oh, nobody wonders
Nobody really cares
Oh, about your intentions
Until you gotten there
When you started out, you were just a blank space
You started out, you were just an ordinary face
You started out, now you've got to finish what you've done
Isn't that why you started in the first place
Started in the first place
If you had ever believed
That you were gonna break
Would you have gotten going in the first place
All these decisions it takes
To get you through the day
With no one even noticing your heart break
Oh, are you alone yes
Are you in trouble no
Oh, people's opinions
They tend to come and go
Oo, when you started out, you were just a blank space
You started out, you were just an ordinary face
You started out, now you've got to finish what you've done
Isn't that why you started in the first place
Started in the first place
How do you know
When you're finally done
If you've got nothing to show
How do you know
When all the people you might trust
All forget to let you know
Oh
Oo, when you started out, you were just a blank space
You started out, you were just an ordinary face
You started out, now you've got to finish what you've done
Isn't the why you started in the first place
Started in the first place
Can you remember at the start
Can you remember trying your first shot
Can you remember wanting to be there
Can you remember wanting to be there
Do you know why you started in the first place
Do you know why you started in the first place
In the first place
Started in the first place
Started in the first place

Well any sense I had is gone
On an open field, you had me run
Where is the light we had before
I don't know why I ask at all
I keep on talking carelessly
I look in books and magazines
Thinking our word could be enough
You look at me, I'm burn it up.
When I hear your good advice, I'm starting something
And good advice, I'm running from it
I didn't ask, and I didn't want it
In an empty room you pardon me
But all around us whispering
But we have now, anyone's guess
So just be rude or your kindest
You give it out so easily
That now I drown in reasoning
I can't held or even hurt
And every word makes me feel worse
When I hear your good advice, I'm starting something
Your good advice , I keep running from it.
I shouldn't ask since I never wanted

When the water won't draw
When the water won't draw
And the river runs dry
And the river runs dry
I been watching that crow
I been watching that crow
Wondering when he's gonna fly
Wondering when he's gonna fly
When the water won't draw
When the water won't draw
Little lover won't satisfy
Little lover won't satisfy
Little lover won't satisfy
Little lover won't satisfy
When the water won't draw
And the river runs dry
I went to market but I didn't come back
Put my penny on the railroad track
Train came creeping like a diamond-back
Make me wanna holler like a mountain jack
People can I get on...
Little lover won't satisfy
Little lover won't satisfy
When the whistle gonna blow
When the whistle gonna blow
Tell me that my work is over
Tell me that my work is done

Worst I bring
I have a dirty mind
Oh, I need, I need new ways
To waste my time
I need new ways
Worst I bring
I live alone, alone, alone
Worst I face
Keep me inside, I need new ways
To waste my time
I need, I need new ways
I'm trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not just cross myself out
Not just disappear
I've been trying to stay out
But there's something in you
I can't be without
I just need it here
I'm trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not to cross myself out
Not to disappear
I've been trying to stay out
But there's something in you
I can't be without
I just need it here
Oh I need
New ways to waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time
I'm trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not just cross myself out
Not just disappear
I've been trying to stay out
But there's something in you
I can't be without
I just need it here
I'm trying to get out
Find a subtle way out
Not to cross myself out
Not to disappear
I've been trying to stay out
But there's something in you
I can't be without
I just need it here
I just need it here
Oh I need
New ways to waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time
Oh I need
New ways to waste my time
I need new ways
To waste my time

[Verse 1:]
It's too late to tell
The damage done
It's too late to find
Where the source came from
Forgiveness calls
It beckons me
To find the courage
Let it be
[chorus]
I fixed my eyes
On redeeming love (4x)
[Verse 2:]
You can't turn back time
You can't erase the truth
You can't relive things
You wanna undo
Fall for words
It'll mark your soul
You heart tender
And your thoughts bold
And I fixed my eyes
On redeeming love (4x)
I fixed my eyes
On redeeming love (4x)

In heaven worm souls flutter
They flutter by with rosaries
Dangling from their necks
German shepherds guide by nightfall
Little kinder
Little kinder dressed in starlight
Inside I feel like
Like I'm crying besides a tree
I'm watching myself like an old T.V.
I'm watching myself like an old movie on color T.V.
When people whisper in Portuguese
It's just as mysterious
And the stubble on his face
It hurt me when
When we fell onto each other's faces
Dawn retraces heart ached patterns across grey oceans
Windows brighten up the room
And one could cast a smooth worn lover's stone
Worn smooth from days of fertile deliberation
Dawn retraces heart ached patterns across grey oceans
Worn smooth from days of fertile deliberation

Sweet dreams all met with derision
This train, it was armed for collision
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
Clap your hands in the sparkle and glitter
Shake your heads at the twisted and bitter
Oh they don't know how lucky they are
Foot down for the alienation
Look on as your love, its gets lost in translation
To a language that nobody understands
There are smiles as they erode and corrupt you
Of the great expectations you could never live up to
We are lost, we are lost, we are lost
Get you coat, 'cause the righteous are leaving
Cause they can't work out what the hell to believe in
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
No abandon, no heartfelt desire
No love could be worth getting fired
For real, it's surreal, it's so real
So paint over the cracks and then cover
What you thought was the worst ever pain with another
And the first one, it always comes free
How they love you so cold and so vicious
With friends like these, well who needs politicians
The first one, its always comes free
They tell you heroin takes like ice cream
Clever men know all that and all this
And they will talk and they talk and the don't fucking listen
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
It's no life but God, it's a living
Come on Jesus Christ, come back all is forgiven
We are lost, we are lost, we are lost
Have no fear of the state of the nation
Let the facts have no bearing on public relations
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
What a model of Christian behavior
Preach on with the message of "go fuck thy neighbor"
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame
Watch your step by the crowd of fanatics
While they kill in the name of applied mathematics
Hate the system even though you invented it
Go kill your brothers and claim self defense of it
Picking up all the secrets and tricks to being
One of the guys whom the shit never sticks to
Take you seats for the final calamity
Don't you look serious, hell, what can the matter be?
Another day and the rot's getting faster
And all the machines started killing the master
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame

Better get your life together, better do it right
You gotta make sure everybody you love in your whole life knows it
Make sure they know it, if you love them make sure that they know it.
Get your life together, better do it right
You better make sure everybody in your life that you love knows it
Better get your life together, better do it right
Make sure that everyone that you love in your life knows it
Better get your life together, better do it right
You gotta make sure everybody you love in your life's important
Better get your life together, better do it right
Better make sure you make time for everything you love.
Better get your life together, better do it right
Better make sure everybody you love in your life knows it
Make sure they know it, make sure they know it
Make sure you tell them, make sure they know
Make sure they know it
Make sure you tell them, take time to tell them
You better get your mind together, you better do it right
Better make sure everybody in your life you love
Better get your life together, better do it right
Better make sure everyone you love in your life knows it
Better get your life together, better do it right
Better make sure everybody you love in your life knows it
Better get your life together, better do it right
Better make sure everyone you love in your life knows it.

If you find me in a gloom, or catch me in a dream,
Inside my lonely room, there is no in between
Whispering pines, rising of the tide,
If only one star shines
That's just enough to get inside,
I will wait until it all goes around
With you in sight, the lost are found,
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea
Protect my only light, 'cause she once belonged to me.
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry
For if I live again, these hopes will never die,
I can feel you standing there
But I don't see you anywhere,
Standing by the well, wishing for the rains
Reaching for the clouds, for nothing else remains,
Drifting in a daze, when evening will be done
Try looking through a haze,
At an empty house, in the cold, cold sun
I will wait until it all goes around,
With you in sight, the lost are found

Painted, wide
With the moon in your eyes
Safe from harm
In the clouds, in your arms
No fog, no fate
No words conceal
You're magic and you're real
Holy wounds and holy ones
We can let it slide
Meet me under cartoon skys
and we'll float for a while
You heal me with a smile
send shivers down my spine
Is it true?
Could you be mine?
Lights out
I finally see you clear
So cool, so calm, so near
No fate, no words conceal
You're magic and you're real

I've been up for days
Trying to find a way to write my confession down
Seems every line I writes amiss
At least this I'll admit
I never hear that perfect sound
But then the judge walks and says
Boy you can't pretend, You've got to be honest now
My verdict has come in
It says I'm guilty for my sins this time
I thought I could escape
But then I finally felt the weight
Of my crimes
This is passion, it's not love
Infatuation never ends up right
At least I won't be alone tonight
'Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
The prosecution rests
They had convincing evidence
It seems I've been deceived
So now I stand alone and wait for the first stone
To be cast upon me
My verdict has come in
It says I'm guilty for my sins this time
I thought I could escape
But then I finally felt the weight of my crimes
This is passion, it's not love
Infatuation never ends up right
At least I won't be alone tonight
'Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
If convicted, I will surely do my time

When you're out
Tell your lucky one
To know that you'll leave
But you don't lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not hear keys
Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed
One a time put a tongue
In your ear on the beach
And you clutched kicking heels

Gonna be a fire come.
Gonna burn a wicked man's feet.
Hate and greed gonna bring down Babylon.
That blackbird, that blackbird he said.
That blackbird, that blackbird he said.
The wind blows broken melodies,
Into the feathers of a blackbird sitting on a branch beside of me.
He said you will never know, the troubles I have seen ,son.
And you should never go, the places I have been.
Lord don't you try to come with me.
Lord don't you try to come with me.
The superstitious cast their stones at me.
Let them stare into the blackness,
Self importance owns the evil it breeds.
And as the river flows,
The stories that it's told, go
Into the well below,
For a blackbird to swallow.
Lord don't you cry I heard them weep,
Lord don't you cry I heard them weep.

At the bottom of the fall I wonder
Was it forth giving all I gave?
In the wake of all the worry
Through the pain, I must be learning
I'm afraid I've seen the light
And I'm only wasting time on something that never was
Will never be innocent all because
I'm on a stepping stone
I'm on a stepping stone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh x2)
Like a bird I used to fly
But the wind is a wild one
Lately I've built a wall and it's hard to trust at all
Many moons will come to pass
And a love that's built to last, will find it's way to me
Now I'm free to be
On a stepping stone
I'm on a stepping stone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh x2)
On and on I run, when all is said and done (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh x2)
[Instrumental]
[(Aba lop hmm ap ah dum x2) (Ooh, oh, oh, ooh oh, oh, oh x2) x2]
On a stepping stone
I'm on a stepping stone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh x2)
On and on I run, when all is said and done (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh x2)
Oh, oh, oh, oh x3

When there's so much darkness closing in
Just swerve around slowly
You'll find an opening.
A light will appear like an animal between the trees
There you'll find your pocket of peace
Make a perfect circle, it's all around you
Put your mark on the map anywhere or nowhere
It's up to you it's not too late to find an opening
Trace a track until you find the end
There's a clearing in every forest, at least one for every man
The light will appear like an animal between the trees
There you'll find your pocket of peace
Make a perfect circle it's all around you
You know that everything lingers for you to follow through
||: It's up to you
It's not too late to find an opening
do you wanna rediscover or do you want it all to be over
do you want to see the meaning of the circleing?

He's the one who needs the night
For worry and interpretation
He's a genius of the wrong kind
He feeds - as he needs the mind
And holding on doesn't stir him
You don't know him but you know he's right
Brother of mine,
To live in the land you own,
Sow and watch grow
The body is all we are
I'm in control
Nothing will seperate
I was once what I see in you
Leo was a friend and saviour
He added colour to the eyes
You're concealing what you know about
In poems and tenacious wordings
You're a genius of the wrong kind
Brother of mine
Grow into the man you are,
How would you know
The body is all we are
I feel whole
Nothing will seperate

Every time you love just a little
Take one step closer, solving a riddle
It echoes all over the world
Every time you opt in to kindness
Make one connection, used to divide us
It echoes all over the world
Every time you choose one more morning
Goodness or meanness, life has one warning
It echoes all over the world
When a leader gets the hungry fed food
When you just make love inside your bedroom
It echoes all over the world

I've spent
22 years in this zoo of broken faces.
Parents and school children watch me sit on this neon nest, naked.
There's a girl in a cage making love to a switchblade
there's a man behind bars milking abandoned cars.
there's a priest in shackles building bombs out of bibles.
And piano wire vines and the men in the pines
that spin round and round and round and round and round.
take me to the pit of celebrity pregnancies.
I want to wear the skin of a magazine baby.
Take me to the pit of celebrity pregnancies.
The five o'clock news is a fucking fantasy.
I stole the rice from the beggars death bowl
in this zoo of broken faces.
I told a widow that she was beautiful
when half of her smile was missing.
and I know my addition:
gun plus gun equals bang bang bang.
And I know my division:
trash into trash equals trash flavored trash.
I want to see more dirty places.
Take me to the hall of filthy faces.
There's a girl behind chicken wire coughing up ghosts.
There's a housewife in a cage that vacuums all day.
There's a boy in a toupee speaking in resumes.
and the teeth-heads with no eyes on the carousl rides that spin
round and round and round and round and round.
I've paid my submission.
I've seen the petition.
I've done my addition.
And I've done my division:
trash into trash equals trash flavored trash.

Can't remember your face
Can't remember your face
Can't remember the place
You didn't need me anyhow
Can't remember your mouth
Can't remember your mouth
Can't remember the house
I didn't need you anyhow
We do without
We do without
We do without
We do without
Can't remember your place
Can't remember your face
Can't remember the house
I didn't need you anyhow
We do without
We do without
We do without
Ah, you said want it
So come and get it now
Can see ya need it
So come and get it now
Can't remember your face
Can't remember the house (place)
Can't remember your mouth (place)
You didn't need me anyhow

Go ahead push your luck
Find out how much love the world can hold
Once upon a time I had control and reined my soul in tight
Well the whole truth
Is like the story of a wave unfurled
But I held the evil of the world
So I stopped the tide
Froze it up from inside
And it felt like
A winter machine that you go through and then
You catch your breath and winter starts again
And everyone else is spring bound
But when I chose to live
There was no joy it's just a line I crossed
It wasn't worth the pain my death would cost
So I was not lost or found
And if I was to sleep
I knew my family had more truth to tell
And so I traveled down a whispering well
To know myself through them
Growing up my mom had a room full of books
And hid away in there
Her father raging down a spiral stair
Till he found someone most days his son
And sometimes I think my father, too, is a refugee
I know they tried to keep their pain from me
They could not see what it was for
But now I'm sleeping fine
Sometimes the truth is like a second chance
I am the daughter of a great romance
And they are the children of the war
Well the sun rose
With so many colors it nearly broke my heart
It worked me over like a work of art
And I was apart of all that
So go ahead push your luck
Say what it is you gotta say to me
We will push on into that mystery
And it will push right back
And there are worse things than that
'cause for every price and every penance that I could think of
It's better to have fallen in love
Than never to have fallen at all
'cause when you live in a world
Well it gets in to who you thought you'd be
And now I laugh at how the world changed me
I think life chose me
After all

[Verse 1]
Today is Friday, it is my day to do what I want
Mama can tell me that I'm goin' nowhere
I'm just a prisoner of my fate
Would you come along, bring me in
Would you come along, bring me in
Bring me in
[Verse 2]
Today is Friday, it is my day to disappear
To kings and queens and make-believe and the demons in my head
Would you come along, bring me in
Would you come along, bring me in
Bring me in
[Hook]
If you were around in my sleep
If you could be found in my sleep
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
[Verse 3]
Today is Friday, it is my day to live a simple life
Put on my make-up, dress up in color
Maybe you might see me down here
Could you come along, bring me in
Would you come along, bring me in
Bring me in
[Hook]
Maybe we'll walk into the rain
To ease what's on my mind-
You both hand in hand
And you're living your life over again
[Verse 1]
[Hook]
[Verse 3]

When I go don't cry for me
In my fathers arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter anywhere I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter anywhere I lay
All my tears be washed away
All my tears be washed away

Ten years ago
I fell in love with an Irish girl
She took my heart
But she went and screwed some guy she knew
and now I'm in Dublin with a broken heart
Oh broken hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy
Oh broken hearted Hoover fixer sucker, sucker guy
One day I'll go there and win her once again
but until then I'm just a sucker of a guy

Hey girl i love you,
Dancing 'round like that will drive me crazy.
But why would i want you,
When it's plain you're not ever wanting me?
Well my whole life all i had was this guitar.
Never gonna be lonely when all i have is music in my heart.
Never gonna wanna be something i am not.
As i get older i'm a be happy with what i got.
'Cause i got music,
and it makes me feel alright.
Got this here music,
and it helps me ease my mind up.
'Cause i got music,
and it takes away the pain.
Got this here music,
and i got it every, every, every day.
Hey my friend's like that,
He drives all those little girls crazy.
Say did you see us,
In the background of the crowd on the TV?
On a summer's day we go and catch some morning waves.
Hanging out with my friends and the vibe can only be ok.
Just like I don't remember rainy days when i was small,
You know i won't remember hatred or nothing at all.

I don't need your inhibitions
'Cause all I need is to be free.
And I don't like no-one to tell me,
Where I'm going to because I can see.
'Cause I can see
'Cause I can see
'Cause I can see
'Cause I can see
Show you all of my intentions,
Get this world, belong to me.
Imitate all my inventions,
A minute too late will never set you free.
Set you free,
Will set you free
Will set you free
Will set you free
Will set you.

Fear
You're just a name that I have learned
Another way for me to turn
And you brought me here
And it took years for me to find
That you were only in my mind
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
Hope
You're just a name that I hold close
There when I needed you the most
And you brought me here
Where I can learn to love myself
Without the love of someone else
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
All I want is love
All I want is love
I don't care what they all say
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care what they all say (all I want is love)
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care if my heart breaks
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
I don't care what they all say (all I want is love)
I don't care if my heart breaks (all I want is love)
I don't care what they all say (all I want is love)
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love

Is there value in the void?
Is there sound to crush through the noise?
Is there a phone that I can call?
Is there a story to be wrought after it all?
You know what I mean
We were so high we couldn't see
That nothing is here,
Nothing is here to stay
Is there a voice inside your head?
All the restless nights that have since been dead?
The streets are quiet these days.
You don't hear a sound when it's so late in the night.
you know what I mean
We were so high we couldn't see
That nothing is here,
Nothing is here to stay

Left the vagabonds
A trail of stones
Forward to find my way home
Now as the air grows cold
The trees unfolds
And I am lost
And not found
And who knows
And who knows
And who knows
Now left the vagabonds
A trail of stones
Forward to find my way home
Now as the air grows cold
The truth unfolds
And I am lost
And not found
And not found

Postpone it
Tell them life's got you
Take time off
Tell them someone needs you
Tell them "all work does is bides you a year"
Before you get out of here
To a place that don't sleep
And the pubs won't shut early
And Your ex'll never call
From the minute you regret it to the minute that you let it go
To the minute you get fed up of tryna please everyone
And the minute you forget that you can pick it up like nothing's changed
You feel like it all starts falling
And you feel like your luck needs changing
I'll be there when it all falls
Sleep through all the rigmarole
Your roomates cause every time they fall
Tell them "all love does is bides you a year"
Before you get out of here
To a place that don't sleep
And the pubs won't shut early
And your ex'll never call

Evening Sun
Why don't you stay
Just a little longer, please
[Chorus:]
My friends and I
Well, our party's almost over
Why don't you stay
Just a little longer please
'Cause I need you bad
I need you better
I need you bad
That I could kill
I need you bad
I need you better
Come on
Evening Sun
Why don't you stay
Just a little longer, please
[Chorus]
My friends and I
Well, our party's almost over
Why don't you stay
Just a little longer please
'Cause I need you bad
I need you better
I need you bad
That I could kill
I need you bad
I need you better
Come on, now

On a clear day I can see far ahead in front of me,
The sky above imagines a god, but on another day I'm...
And when I fall the hurt won't show up on me I only hope.
And if I follow you along well then I'll rise up.
CHORUS:
And when the burning sun it falls in my eyes,
Is when I come upon another sunrise.
Well I will walk alone 'cause I'm not scared to die,
On a clearer day in the sunshine.
And when I hear the angels sing down from up above,
Well I won't fear a thing or hear the things I've done.
Only know that you're in a place inside my heart,
And no matter where I go, we will never part.
CHORUS:
And when the burning sun it falls in my eyes,
Is when I come upon another sunrise.
Well I will walk alone 'cause I'm not scared to die,
On a clearer day in the sunshine.
