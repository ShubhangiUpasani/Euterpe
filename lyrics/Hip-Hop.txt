Who put the monkey wrench in well oiled prefectionist emblem
Just to watch these moniters spit white noise
through your office space?
Automate.
I infect jolly gene pool descendent cloud clusters
starving art revolution sound jugglers.
Delinquent fan for brick habitat.
Bob, weave, stick, move, fence
and pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention.
This years brain crops spread spectacular.
I ain't mad at cha, don't stay mad at the caliber.
I twist characters like twist characters.
Tally up the alley cat aggresion
in this Doug E. Fresh infested mess up bass line lust.
An automatic B-boy krylon can combust circuits
Working these war picked cyphers
with Ted Stryker stability and kamakazi chivalry.
I alone noble in a warm food feud
Walking dead generation.
Ain't nobody asking for your patience.
The grand opening holding me to the fact
that I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else.
(Talk about labor)
Fantastic planet urchin puting work in.
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversion.
Apologies won't lore me to the communal sob story
nor would I sacrifice lifestyle to benefit jury temperament.
This whole Green Goblin web cutter butts up against
crayola daydream landscapes spittin bedlam, dead 'em.
Charge the villagers nickles and nicotine
to watch him fed to one disgruntled kraken at high noon.
We'll sell popcorn, beer and balloons
I got an inkling this gon be the one children bicker over.
Its that warriors vs. baseball fury element
to glitch his motor sensory development
I am a star, really.
The big bang bastard's back
with a one way ticket to Beat Street.
This all is like relevent to human kind supply/demand ratios
man, learn it.
I work past the surface
I work on what I love, I work to service all my burdens
And I'll work until this here little flat line closes the curtains

All you niggas out there holding hands with these motherfuckers street
Them motherfuckers behind doors holding meat
You might be holding a nasty ass
Chorus (2x):
Nasty bitch, gonna fuck my boy
Now how you gonna fuck my boy
That's why I don't love them hoes
You can't trust these dog ass hoes
Verse: 1
I was in love like a motherfucker with this bitch
But uhh, I wasn't doing nothing but making her rich (shit)
But damn, she used to played it so cooled
I guess she must take see for a fool
I swear the sex had my motherfucking mind gone
And I was tweeking like a fiend for that heroin
And when I put it in, the way that she moaned,
made me never ever wanted to leave her alone
The back rubs in the hot tubs, watching videos
It made me crawl when she took it all down her throat
Surprise, shit I hit her with a five karat
And later on we can talk about marriage (huh)
Ya name tatted on my chest, fuck them other broads
We hold hands when we walking through the shopping malls
My brother told me V charge it to the game
But uhh, listen up, cause it's a motherfucking shame
Chorus (2x)
Verse: 2
I used to page this girl about ten times a day
But after 9, she was hard to find
One-of-a-kind, huh, so I was blind with the problems we had
Found a number in her purse, said it was her dad
I got a phone call from my nigga Jubilee
He told me, he saw my girl in the movies
With another nigga, nut it wasn't me
I said man, you must be tripping, nigga it couldn't be
I thought it was love, but I guess the love was gone
So then I put up the phone and then I went home
Park the car, walked in the door, walked up the stairs
And I damn near slipped on her underwear
Opened the bedroom door, seen a ho,
with a nigga ro, bout to grab my fo-fo, hold
Damn, bitch I thought we loved each other
Nasty bitch gonna fuck my brother
Bitch, get the fuck out my house,
pick up your dirty ass draws, get that cum off your chest,
and wipe your motherfucking mouth, and get the fuck out, biatch!
Fuck you gonna fuck my motherfucking boy

To my heart stop or blood touch the concrete
Beyond deep, these streets got me gripping my heat
Losing sleep, breaking day sling crack to fiends

The cash the cream from the cradle to the casket green

Yellow tape the sidewalk and leave a nasty scene
Your back is spling ya brain, face and chest get sprayed
The desert the miss the spot when it bust your way
We touch we lay in the streets it's a must we play
We cook, we chop bust pots down and clust the way
From light to day it's only right that we cock and spray
We speeding on could spot a snake from a block away
I told you a what the game need is a change of speed
Visualize the realism

When I die, I'm gone go in fashion, guns blasting
Cash inside coffins, memories get lost when you die
The legacy is eye for an eye

Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave
[Verse 1]
Cowards en traced all this anger and hatred
Gon' make me damage abrasion my attitude is very impatient
Nigga crossed me, first thing I wanna do is erase him
Yea he used to be my dog, but fuck a relation
Once he get money and fame, everybody starts aging
Shit ain't no longer the same, your own niggaz be hatin'
Can't see another brother succeed
So you backstab 'em just to see how long he'll bleed
But I'm a strong man, pops always told me never fear no man
That's why I'm scarred up on both hands
And never love a bitch, hell naw I can't trust a bitch
Fuck 'em and leave 'em, that's the way you thug a bitch
It's how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage
And I'm just too stuck in my ways (You hear me?)
Its how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage
And I'm just too stuck in my ways (So fuck y'all)
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Dog I came here to prove your wackness
Bunch of useless bastards always frontin', moving backwards
This is hardcore, ain't no acoustic classic
Nigga swift for anything reserving using a ratchet
Competition stand 'em in line, cause without permission
I'm handling mine, occupation scramble and grind
Stop your facing, shank you with knives
You're missing a born soldier, operation declined
I'm like a optician, with a vision to shine
A hundred steps ahead of y'all, ain't no getting behind
Say what I choose 'cause I done payed my dues
Came from an error of pain and terror, alot of rainy weather
I learned to survive through the hatred and lies
That's why from far away, I can spot a snake in disguise
And believe me dog we ain't scared, hope you came prepared
Straight Strong-Armin, nigga we don't play fair
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Fat Joe]

Ya heard me?
Youngn' Rest
Uh, yo, yo
Gear up, you need to fear us
One false move and get paw-pierced up
Drinking like one high loop, man I bang you in the club
Drain the henny out your stomach and replace it with blood
You wish us to hell 'cause we too real
Selling two mills and still ain't afraid to pull steal
Ready Rock ain't concerned with y'all
I'm too big too strong for y'all
And I came too long for y'all, ya heard Pun
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
Heard you niggaz want it with us, a fatal mistake
Been blazing the game since niggaz fourth-aides
Crack is king, man the city is mine
And I ain't got no problem with bidding with +Shyne+
Here's the real deal homie, stakes is high
Look at the mirror man I bet you hate your life (Mu'fucker)

(pump pump, lickin shots)
[erick sermon]
Aiyyo it's the master rap maniac, comin fat like dat
That's my habitat, with the funk track
From the boondocks, when I rocks my styles out the docks
Who who? I hear someone knockin at my door
It must be soup, a black human bein
I think it's about time for y'all to see him
[soup]
Sometimes I get blindsided with the flow, I never know
They yell hoe, assumin the motions of a cool flow
Notions of a cool, it's the s, ohhhhhh
Never come test, noooooooo, cause even the best'll have to
Go out with the rest, nestea and a bag of sess for me
Ackninckulous, I kill the weeds in my chest
[erick sermon]
Back on the rebound, it's the magnificents funkdullah
Old schooler, more sole/soul than dr. scholl-ah
Freakin wicked so it sticks in your dome
On the chrome microphone so I take it home
Don't neglect, just respect, the mic check
Don't forget, I still snap necks and come correct
I leave the microphone burnin (burnin)
Green eyed bandit, my ? full name is erick sermon
[soup]
Erick sermon, sermon with the preaching
I'm fuckin up people's heads without speaking, without speaking
Clearly, loudly, niggaz crowd around the speaker
To hear me freak the, note like tamika
But sweeter, sixty phoneta, sneaker if you
Peep the, jams and you reap the fields
With the roots and uh, my name is soup, and uh
I flow like orange juice or tropicana, and uh
Chorus
[erick sermon]
Breaker breaker, shh, I hear some static
Stop and get my automatic, the rusty one from the attic
And shoot, or be killed, and if I ill I might cause
A bloodspill so I have to chill and get
Totally disgusting on the microphone
Whyyyyyyyyy, because it's onnnnn (it's on, it's on)
It's on (it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on!!)
[soup]
The industry is a trick, and everyone is on the dick
A cheap trick, just like ? like ?
I peep it, everyone, wants me to sound like
A ? , I'm dyin, before I get up from behind
It's crushin up the rush of the rhyme in my mind
Drink and trust - blind, think and trust - my, nine
Because, nine lives nine triggers
Fine rhymes equal the nine figures
Yeah the cold cash, I hold a bold stash
Yeah pockets next to my nineteen year old ass
Yeah, God bless the child with his own
God bless the roots and outsiders who zone
Motherfuckers caps, get bucked in the dome
Lick a shot, in his mad packed crazy chrome
Chorus (+ soup shouting over)
[soup]
Like that, but it's all words
Words can kill more pens, than guns, and friends
And foes, God knows, I chose the pros
That rose, still froze-n, chose-n, you
S-o-u and the p, e, r-i-c-k
Erick sermon, kickin a rhyme this way
Yeah! it's all in, your mind
It's all in, my mind
It's all in, my mind..

You enter, step in the room, four, five
My over compressed thoughts and ways make you get live
You are the patient, and I, your black doctor,
Medical bills, insurance, cash in the ceiling.
Dioxalyn fingerprints here ever since
I got my white suit pressed, out the cleaners,
X-Ray shades, with hard shoes and some razor blades
Who's the brother that's sick, and needs the operation?
Bullets removed from your head, grand central station
I gotta cut off your ear, first behind your neck
Rip out the stomach, and open rectum?s to dissect
Shine the light, inside, roaches crawling in your throat
I have no tools, my hammer?s done, my drill is broked
I'm the doctor,
You wait on the waiting list,
Patients been here since this morning I dismiss.
Watching people vomit green, my po-lig is lizard pills
My office in Berbick, I had the bodies in Beverley Hills.
Seeking Kimbles and bits, a girl with small tits
Talking to herself, her dog, and having rabid fits
Green fly soup in on the way from the kitchen, troop
Looking at T.B tuberculous on the window post
Ten dead dogs, a brown fox in the comatose
With no reps, I put more needles in they kneecaps
Some primitive screws, and my, yes and perhaps
A little sprinkle of Clorox, in their vocal box
Some Pepto-Bismol, Pepsi-Cola, pack of Pop Rocks
Mix it all together with bugs, to change the weather,
You be coughing blue, with eyes like Mr. Magoo
Straight up cartoon, you're bound to fall out real soon.
I'm the doctor,
You wait on the waiting list,
Patients been here since this morning I dismiss.
As you come in the bright, you ride the orange ambulance
Look at widows and pell see the mental patients dance
Doin' six and seven, steps ladies yells dance
Upside downside with walls flyin' through the hall
Mr. Reeves/Mysteries with yellow bees they fly, sting your face
You out there bumps, caught up with a acne case
Plastic surgery, your lawyer now refer to me
Giving you sketches, exquisite pictures of the gill man
What's the matter, are you happy? Na you're ill man
Standin' back, you choose a ticket,
My spiritual laws of vitamins will turn your face wicked
You're invited to ride the glide to your homicide
I'm the doctor,
You wait on the waiting list,
Patients been here since this morning I dismiss.

Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball
Then I met this girl she tried to gank me
So I smacked her in the pootie with a Plank, B
'Cause me and my crew were out breaking windows
The bingo, the lotto you know I'll never win those
Possession is half the law
I had my routines before all y'all
Your whole life is coming apart at the seams
You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
See, I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie
Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass
Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass
You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat
See, personally I wouldn't wanna go out like that
I'm a writer, a poet, a genius, I know it
I don't buy cheeba I grow it
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money-hungry miser
Had a 'caine-filled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me, you always want to try me
Yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast
All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat
Like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'
Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'
Space cake cookies I discover who I am
I'm a dusted old bummy hurdy-gurdy man
Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains
Said good-bye to my girl, my lawyers and accountants
My mind is kinda rhymin' and I think I oughta think
So I'm rockin' all the rhymes and I'll have another drink
So the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning
Of another rhyme I'm rapping, M.C-ing I rock
You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped

(Get down)
[The Fresh Prince:]
I was.. cruisin down the avenue, early one Friday
When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way
I turned my back to ?????????????
And I said, "Hm-hm, excuse me," and she walked past
She was about 5'6", or maybe six and a half
With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!
Tight leather pants that fit like a drum
And two big - yeah well, she had some
Anyway from behind she was fine
But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine
At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny
But the laughter ceased when she said: "Hey honey!"
At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound
My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground
And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky
I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy?!
I tried to get away, I said, "Well, never mind
Maybe I'll see you some other time"
But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave
And said, "Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans!"
This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world
My whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl
And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain
They said, "Prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed"
My pride was busted right along with my eye
Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache
[The Fresh Prince:]
I remember last year, the day was October 5th
And my family went away on a weekend ski trip
And they left $100 and a note by the phone
That said: 'Don't have any company till we get home'
No company? I'm 18! They must be jokin!
And by 10 my crib was smokin
All of my friends with their hands in the air
Screamin (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!)
The party was jammin till at least about 5
And as my friends were leaving, they were like "Homes, it was live!"
I thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin
I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women
Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties
I gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties
I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em
I said, "Hi, my name's the Prince," they said, "Hi Prince, we're your harem"
I didn't waste time, I started shootin the gift
I said, "Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with"
I walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin
Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin
The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead
With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head
Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you
They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture
I said, "Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you?
What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?"
She turned around and smiled and laughed
And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache
Not four girls, four guys!
They were in disguise, it was a set up all the time
I made a complete fool of myself that day
My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away
They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost
There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post
My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question
"Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?"
Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived
I said, "What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!"
"I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece
Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police"
I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever
My pop told me I was on punishment forever!
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache

All I do is stay focused, looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up, I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go, man, let's go
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self-defeat is your own dispute
And, man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
'Cause you're starring in your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right and know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold down all the sprinklers on Mt. Olympus
My god's tougher than Zeus
When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
'Cause in life you cannot press rewind
Get it right: you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell
And disregard those who most need your help?
Thick-skinned, the dark won't take my soul
Survived spiritual wars, see my welts?
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end
When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better, just be a go-getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
The drastic time call for drastic measure
Your girl tied to pleasure from your neighbor since ever
The land and the treasure work for whatever
Just don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper believe in every skin
No matter which color they are
Would never let, Him not care which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebbecca
Don't stop for a second
Every man reckon it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in
When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (only the strong will continue)
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
I'm a street-lifer always harassed by the C ciphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerge from the street life
This for the homies who relate, know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis the Thirteenth life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon, if that's you and me tonight
I pray our fate's greater
I speak life, I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Cowman
How in the hell am I supposed to stay comfy
When I pay child-support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, but only hos want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say they man connin'
So I'm stuck with some married woman so fine
Cheatin' while they husband is rushin' on the forty-yard line
Wonder if this is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas always seem to end up with some hard times
Hope not, if a pimp slippin' in a ho plot
Ain't nothin' to a G in a two-tone drop
Kid, and it don't stop
See a nigga disappearin' with the baddest honies in the whole spot, yeah

I really don't know how long I've been doing this sh-t
I guess 2010's the first year you gave a sh-t
I was the underdog so please excuse me a bit
I need some space so someone please make me some room in this bitch
cause I'm in Beast mode, beast mode
give me those beats I eat those
all day I don't sleep no
I don't even know what I got sheets for
them pillow cases and bed frames oh nah take that, don't need those
so high I don't get high, don't even know what I got weed for
people I'm in beast mode, why'd you think I got these teeth for
why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O
but see I knew this before
anybody fed my ego
back in the hood at east shows
so we take hood wherever we go
please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it's gained
dedicated, determined, dependable
yes I committed myself to the game
don't be letting them tell you them lies
we make the industry real when it's fake
so stay meditating so your head is facing into the direction you aim bitch!
Okay then, know what my name is
excuse my language but I'm fed up with the same sh-t
they say they love me but its really cause I'm famous see
my momma told me all this back when I was nameless
so f-ck y'all, I'm shameless, I'm a beast unleashed I'm raging
I'm living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I'm playing
I ride around and they praise me
I crack a smile and they waving
I guess you could call me David Ruffin I'm circled in the Temptations
or maybe I'm angry, maybe I just need a little more patience
or maybe I'm crazy, maybe I just get a little too anxious
some-times-I-rhyme-like-I'm-inside-Einsteins-mind
look at the time fly by, plenty of times I've died
looking at these jive guys claiming they lost there mind
she aint really seen sh-t n-gga til you had the whole World flipped upside down
right side up from the DEC so the Eastside's up
fired up so you know when I get to the booth I go ham
cause I gotta do what I can
something like Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish, Adonai 'Tsebayoth i chant
I'm kinda like a blur with these words, yes I'm a wizard with these verbs
running at a hundred kilometers
pretty soon I'mma leave Earth
Earthlings, or whatever Human beings, I'mma beast
your a feast, curly fries, onion rings
this is not a f-cking game
aint no referee's involved
this is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
Entourage, ham squad to be exact, smoking ham, smacking back
take your girl have her back, we don't want her round my team
she's a slut and she's a freak, but you don't know cause she's discreet
I swear I see everything thats a bit, man I'm fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish Hayley where you at
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
but I only attack
Cause I'm in beast mode, just beast mode

Young and attractive
Quote unquote old soul
Down in a cold hole
Playing my controlled roll
The world is mine good and bad
I never sleep, Odd charms
Firetrucks and squad cars, struggling in God's arms
Tempted and restless, blood in my arteries
Floods in the armouries
Drugs are a part of me
Circus in fun time, surface in sunshine
Brush your teeth, don't believe
So much darkness underneath
Parties and funerals, nurseries and graveyards
Lotteries, robberies an old couple plays cards
Company, visitors, frequency, rise on,
Weekends, a sequence of secrets and lies
Oddities, prodigies, fireworks, parades for me
Same story, all my decisions are made for me
Reading from loose leaf, mislead and seduce me
I'm so full of love and bleeding profusely
(refrain)
Concrete and steel I remember these drums
A chill in the air, in september she comes
Pretty and sad, trying not to cry, trying not to cry so, pretty and so sad
X2
These are my telephone poles, my dark trenches, my broken windows, my park benches
Raccoons and back rooms, giants and small children's, glitter in traffic
The outlines of tall building still in self defence I kill.
Yes I will, If they make me do things against my will
Some make fun of what I wear, and cut my hair
Goblins and problems I've got my share
I bitch and complain, and I admit that it's strange
Parts of my self that I wish I could change
Insecurities, complexes, x's and marking spots
Complicated beauty of abandoned buildings and parking lots
Market thoughts and impulses, rebellion and upheaval
Tribal indescribable pleasure in such evil
Review the proof, crime is going through the roof,
Accuse the youth.
You'd puke if you knew the truth
Refrain x2
(voice)
Love me once again
(voice) indistinguishable

[Verse 1]
When I met you baby, you was for sale
I just stepped out of the county jail
For a punk ass misdemeanor
My P.O. dont like Nickatina
And an old man was lettin' ya go
And I could see I was what you was looking for
He said bring me a G, then next week a G
I said "Check this out pops I'm back tomorrow at 3"
Dont worry how I got that G
Just worry I was right back there at 3
Started you up, and it was legit
I never thought I'd fall in love so quick
Filled you up with gasoline
Took you to the wash spot and got ya clean
Cleaned the dash, rubbed that ass
And everything was slow, I didnt do it fast
Man it took about an hours time
But you looked so fine from the waxy shine
And on my mind I thought about the Alpines
So I loaded your behind with some 6 x 9's
So when you sing people hear you sang
I'm a nigga so baby I'm a do these thangs
Pioneers blastin' out Aretha Franklin
Sometimes I'm wonderin' what you thankin'
[Chorus 2x]
My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
You dont fake, steal, cheat, or lie
My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
And our relationship is classified
[Verse 2]
I remember the day I bought me some Timbs
That was the same damn day I bought you some rims
At Kims, in the city of dope
And once we hit the streets, me and you, we smoked
On weed, wrapped in chocolate phillies
Other freaks saw us and they went silly
I remember ones name, her name was Billy
The other was a cousin out of Kansas City
They'll drop they clothes, I suppose
But meanwhile my baby girl needs some vogues
She told me everything that was on her mind
Who she loved, who she despised
Why she like the night way better than the day
And did I like Ali or Casius Clay?
I said "I like your conversation how you shoot to kill
But whats this strange relationship?"
She said if I can hang, than she can hang
And we'll never hit the bay bridge in the slow lane
No thang, like bangers bang
And she hate the police just as much as me mayne
[Chorus 2x]
I could feel you get jealous when I rented a freak
Your carborator had you layin' up for weeks
Then we smoked like friends, put that to an end
Now I'm back in her muthafuckin' heart again
Cleaned your leather, got a darker tint
Over the rearview got the cherry scent
Hit the streets, like mean Joe Greene
Thats when I told her about my scheme
A night trip back and forth from L.A.
So I'm a have to leave you for about a day
It was cool, L.A.'s the spot
But I couldnt wait to see my lady on the block
But just like a bullet had hit my spine
As soon as the focus had hit my eyes
My fist tightened up, I was mad and stunned
My baby was the victim of a hit and run
She was cryin', she said Dre, man I look so ugly
Is there a way you'll ever love me?... Nope
She seen it in my eyes
A brand new vision of a brand new ride
[Chorus 2x]
New ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)
That wont fake, steal, or lie
New ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)
And out relationship is classified
Check it...
To my tiga grand wizard
Its me
What (what)
Check it

Red alert, has anybody seen my pussy cat
I done looked everywhere, and still don't know just where she at
How she look, light brown
Hazel eyes, chunky thighs
Long hair, long nails
Big booty, long tail
Yo, she the type of cat that climb telephone poles
Super freaky alley cat, yo anything goes
If anybody listenin, have any type of clue
Call me up and when I get there, playa all you got to do is just
Chorus:
Pass the pussy (Wooo-wooo)
Pass the pussy (Wooo-wooo)

Pass the pussy (Wooo-wooo)
Weeee (Wooo-wooo)
My kitty shouldn't be hungry, 'cause i feed her all the time
Once a 6, once at 12, once at 5, once a 9
I gotta break her off, 'cause her drive is super hot
Turn me out, and thats why I gotta find my cutie pie
So here itty bitty witty pretty little kitty kitty
Daddy want you to come home, so I can get a little itty bitty
So if you listening, and if you got a clue
Call me up and when I get there, playa all you got to do is just
Chorus
Don't stop now, can't stop now (x4)
I wanna put a a-p-P, out on my c-a-T
'cause I'm horney, and I want it kinda b-a-D
You are my d-o-G , thats why I'm tryin to get mine
Neighbors got they own cat, but they be tryin to hit mine
But I don't hate, see my pussy cat is free to roam the yard
Scope this only yard, 'cause she know who own the yard
I know she'll be back home, she'll ask the sky is blue
But if you see her before I do, playa all you got to do is just
Chorus
Don't stop, work it work it (x8)

Flimode up in this mutha fucka just for the record
[Chorus]

Round and round, in a haze
Every night waiting for you
You run hot, then you're cold
But this game you play is, getting old
Now it's time you learned, with fire you're
Gonna get burned
And my heart is stone, I'd rather be alone
Just turn and walk away
There ain't nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can do to make me stay
After all, the love is gone, it's gone
I closed my eyes, pretend that there was nothing wrong
In my heart, in my soul, I remember every lie
You told
Now I stand my ground, never gonna turn around
And my heart is stone, I'd rather be alone
Just turn and walk away
There ain't nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can do to make me stay
After all, the love is gone
You can beg me down on your knees
You can tell me that you'll never leave
After all, the love is gone Ya Ya
I'm gonna close that door, forget you're alive
Don't come around no more, I'm walking away

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that sometimes it's easier to desire
and pursue the attention and admiration of 100 strangers
than it is to accept the love and loyalty
of those closest to me
And I would tell you that sometimes
I prefer to look at myself
through someone else's eyes
Eyes that aren't clouded with the tears of knowing
what an asshole I can be, as yours are.
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I might be able to listen in silence to your concerns
rather than hearing everything as an accusation
or an indictment against me
I would tell you that sometimes
I use sex to avoid communication
it's the best escape when we're down on our luck
But I can express more emotions than laughter, anger, and let's fuck
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that I pooped in my own dog dish
And sometimes I would rather face not eating
than face licking it clean
And admitting when I'm selfish
And I'd tell you that I'm suffering
from the worst type of loneliness
The loneliness of being misunderstood,
or more poignantly
the loneliness of being afraid
to allow myself to be understood
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that the personal revolution
is far more difficult
and is the first step in any revolution
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that music is the expression of emotion
And that politics is merely the decoy of perception

[Spoken]
What I've realized since is that it's a very painful process but it is not destructive. It's the road to liberation. The what really happened in the sixties was that this country took just the first step toward admitting that it had been wrong on race, and creativity burst out in all directions.
From the color of the faces in Sunday songs
To the hatred they raised all the youngsters on
Once upon a time in this country, long ago
She knew there was something wrong
Because the song said "yellow, red, black, and white
Every one precious in the path of Christ"
But what about the daughter
Of the woman cleaning their house?
Wasn't she a child they were singin' about?
And if Jesus loves us, black and white skin
Why didn't her white mother invite them in?
When did it become a room for no blacks to step in?
How did she already know not to ask the question?
Left lasting impressions
At a lesson, comfort's gone
She never thought things would ever change
But she always knew there was something wrong
Always knew there was somethin' wrong.
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
Years later, she found herself
Mississippi bound to help
Stop the legalized lynching of Mr. Willy McGee
But they couldn't stop it
So they thought that they'd talk to the governor about what'd happened
And say, "We're tired of being used as an excuse to kill black men"
But the cops wouldn't let 'em past
And these women, they struck 'em as uppity
So they hauled 'em all off to jail
And they called in protective custody
Then from her cell
She heard her jailers
Grumblin' about "outsiders"
When she called 'em out
And said she was from the south, they shouted,
"Why is a nice, Southern lady makin' trouble
For the governor?"
She said, "I guess I'm not your type of lady
And I guess I'm not your type of Southerner
But before you call me traitor,
Well it's plain as just to say
I was a child in Mississippi
But I'm ashamed of it today"
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
([spoken] And, all of a sudden, I realized I was on the other side)
Imagine the world that you're standing within
All of your neighbors, they're family-friends
How would you cope facing the fact
The flesh on their hands was tainted with sin?
She faced this every day
People she saw on a regular basis
People she loved, in several cases
People she knew were incredibly racist
It was painful, but she never stopped loving them
Never stopped callin' their names
And she never stopped being a Southern woman
And she never stopped fighting for change
And she saw that her struggle was
in the tradition of ancestors never aware of her
It continues today:
The soul of a Southerner
born of the other America
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
[Spoken]
What you win in the immediate battles is little compared to the effort you put into it but if you see that as a part of this total movement to build a new world, you know what could be (????? "oooh, ooooh"). You do have a choice. You don't have to be a part of the world of the lynchers. You can join the other America. There is another America!

I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport
'N told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for ??
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother ??
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck[?] is all that's glistenin'
What you steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined
I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt
y'all matter less everytime this margarita tilt
[Chorus]
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear
Get some show money from UGLY and buy a keg of beer
And another pig to give my other pigs some company
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary
In due time, but there's business left to attend to
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another ? before my great aunt Missy
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy
Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen??
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be
An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable
Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny...

Trunk fulla speakers, pocket fulla doe
How much would a wood chuck chuck
If a wood chuck could chuck wood
Gripping on the wheel
Turn it turn it
Blow another stack
I earned it earned it
Blow another amp
Pull another tram
Light another blunt
Burn it burn it
Flame it up
Hear my flow, I changed it up
Everybody grab your gats
And hold em, load, sock em
Lock em, cock em
And aim it up
Bang it up
Off in the sky
Catch me rollin' off in the ride
26 inches
Leave em defenseless
45 always tucked in the side
Open your eyes
See me cruisin'
'Cause I keep winning
And these boys keep losing
Plus I'm, the pimp of the year
Playas is hatin' and hos is choosing
Look at all the hos you losing
Then look at all the game I got
And you can catch me creepin' on the low low
Luda ridin' solo, beatin' the block
In the streets I'm peepin' game
I can't trust you, no no
All up in my bigness mayne
I stay on the low low
Say they really really fake
Can't mess with you no mo'
Closest people to you hate
So I be rollin' solo
I'm creepin' on the low low
Creepin' on the low low
Creepin' on the low low
I be rollin', I be rollin' solo
I'm creepin' on the low
Creepin' on the low low
Creepin' on the low low
I be rollin', I be rollin' solo
I'm creepin' on the low

As we fondle through the sheets, so sweet
Bodies heatin', now I sweat 'cause I ain't done yet

She licked my neck, we connect, Diggy Daz is a vet

From the back, side to side, 'til the sun start to rise
Just before you know, huh, I'm back in them thighs
Goin' "ah, ah" tryin' to catch that feelin'
Cause I love the way you do it, sincerely Daz Dilli
Come on and do it just like, girl get wit it

Dark skinned and light skinned, yo I'm all up in it
Just let me hit it, let me make it hot from the beginnin'
Bend it over, let me show you how Diggy's supposed to
Fuck that pussy when a nigga come over
Hard as a boulder, let me grab your shoulder
Been waitin' for this pussy girl, now you're older
Lay with a nigga, won't you blaze up a blunt
I wanna give it to you girl, just like you want
No need to front, slow and fast when I pump
Baby girl let me tell you, this ain't no stunt
Squeeze it tight, make it right, give it to me all night
Yo we drunk, feelin' buzzed 'cause we high as a kite
Give it to ya five minutes 'cause she started to suck it
Can't go wrong so I puts on rubber
Cut it open like mamba, you start to wonder
Cause I make it hot like July summer

[Chorus]
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
Last year, Jazze Phe got stuck up inside the grand Lux,
Most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap,
Cause you're body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzin' but my liquor,
Cali chickens got to the 80's strip and come back a little thicker,
With more ass then Delicious, that's my flavor of love,
We make it rain like Rain-man, when he play with the glove,
I'm the king to you pawn niggas, punisher, spawn, niggas,
Playin' in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggas,
We them barbecue, front and back lawn niggas,
Summer Jam, throw your ass offstage Akon niggas,
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga,
Take that Champion hoody off in the California sunshine
[Chorus]
I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire boulevard,
We can't find Biggies killers so we gave Diddy a star,
And I'm by far, Hollywood boulevard,
But I'm from a boulevard that taught yall to shoot out of moving cars,
Remember, New Jersey driver's like a East Coast menace,
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dogg in it,
Give me a New York minute,
To show you Cali got more dead bodies then the Yankees got New York pennants,
Cause we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted,
I duck shots where Venus and Sarena used to play tennis,
And they never came back, like throwin' a boomerang flat,
See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat,
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,
Niggas roll up on you, Now you stuck in that Harold and Cane trap,
If you slippin' in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,
I know some niggas that know some niggas, I'll get your chain back.
[Chorus]
Niggas already know who had the marijuana first,
We birthed haze and sour diesel, I was there when the water burst,
Hell nah we don't surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in the fuckin' hearse,
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,
Don't you ever, ever leave me out of the top 10 you fuckin' bastards
Blow
[Chorus]

They lied when they said there was no air in space
MC shit right here, master of the ceremonies
All that other garbage
One dimensional emcees can't handle that
Yo music is my love, press play on steroid
Life is a breath of fresh air, mahogon-oid
Negroids act like Sigmund Freud
Dreaming of a perfect I-roid, screaming cerebrum steroid
Faking jack decoys got beef with Ox
You can get caught in my Real Earth chatterbox
That's virtual, if you drunk a V8
You couldn't be parallel 'cause hell is vertical
Aha, fooled ya, thought it was beneath you
Got propelled in the sky, now soul is see through
But it doesn't matter 'cause there's no molecules
Then genius becomes burden to ridicules
Realize much at stake
And excuse me for lack of better words
That's my bond that never breaks
Pierce hearts with stakes, bloodsuckers cast no reflection
In my prism detention, they hate
On prison's intentions, get diesel, read a book
Find God in a cell block, that's your fate
I'm that voice in the back of LL's head saying
"You gonna let a weed plant do that?"
Yeah, I like to instigate
This ain't a space race so why you rushin'
To be the first to catch a concussion, from El-P's percussion
Watch me throw a sentence in the air, say word up
That's just a phrase for my action like a bum with a cup
And Rome wasn't built in a day but it fell in one
And you don't got half of a step but you walk like one
I got calluses on my hand 'cause I held the sun uneven
I got the weight of the world on my chest and still breathin'
Can Ox is like 007 and man from uncle
You off the top broke but I rip the turn buckle
You a Halloween thug, I'll expose ya face
And use you as an example that fell from grace
They lied when they said there was no air in space
I'll boil an emcee to the teeth with no trace
I'm like Moses with a staff that parts the Red Sea
But it's a new day, so I use the mic to depart emcees
This earth is as real as a Chinese fortune cookie
In English with lottery numbers, I'm finished
Uh with lottery numbers, I'm finished, yo, yo
And one dimensional emcees, can't handle that
And one dimensional emcees, be biting backs
And one dimensional emcees, be getting smacked
Now one dimensional emcees, know how to act
I said, "One dimensional emcees, can't handle that
And one dimensional emcees, be biting backs
And one dimensional emcees, be getting smacked
Now one dimensional emcees, know how to act"
I said, "One dimensional emcees, can't handle that
Wha come on, wha y'all can't handle that"
I said, "One dimensional emcees, be biting backs
Wha, what, can't handle that"
I said, "One dimensional emcees, can't handle that
And one dimensional emcees, be biting backs
And one dimensional emcees, Def Jux, be getting smacked
Now one dimensional emcees, know how to act"
It's like that, Real Earth, take me out of there
Real turf, take me out of there
2001, space odyssey, what, cold vein, uh
And one dimensional
And one dimensional
And one dimensional

This is so amazing, got my heart racing.
The way it goes down, not afraid to say you can take charge.
Got my eyes in the back of my head while I'm seeing stars.
It sounds like you're ready, girl. for daddy, girl.
An we don't have to prolong, in fact we can get a track
And do it to the sound of a hand clap
Let me handle that ooh just how you like it babe.
I can give you what you lack, don't take it in a negative way.
Baby it's a fact, when we get up in the sack, I'm gonna break ya back in a good way.
Stop, then we start again.
I can hear ya moaning.
And were not alone yes, I can see our shadows on the wall, moving gracefully.
There's people in the other room, but I don't really give a damn baby.
I've been really missing you and I am sick and tired of waiting
Forever, whenever baby, I am definitely ready.
We can role play and make it a game.
Let me handle that ooh just how you like it baby.
I can give you what you lack, don't take it in a negative way.
Baby it's a fact, when we get up in the sack, I'm gonna break ya back in a good way.
Let me handle that ooh just how you like it baby.
I've been thinking about it all day. (ooh)
Baby it's a fact, when we get up in the sack, I'm gonna break ya back in a good way.
Baby ring the alarm, we bout to get it on.
I'll do whatever it takes just to keep you satisfied.
You don't have to worry about a thing, cause were going all night.
Let me handle that ooh just how you like it baby.
I can give you what you lack, don't take it in a negative way.
Baby it's a fact, when we get up in the sack, I'm gonna break ya back in a good way.
Let me handle that ooh just how you like it baby.
I can give you what you lack, don't take it in a negative way.
Baby it's a fact, when we get up in the sack, I'm gonna break ya back in a good way.
Let me handle that ooh just how you like it baby.
I can give you what you lack, don't take it in a negative way.
Baby it's a fact, when we get up in the sack, I'm gonna break ya back in a good way.
(Well be making love)
(Loving ya baby)

It's going on 5, I want you to know
My spirit's alive, I want you to know
I'm getting down with the awkward moments
I'm getting down with the sour kiss
I'm getting down with the rumors in the back of the car
I'm getting down with it
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
Signal when you get to the top
Signal when you want me
When you want me to stop
We could, we could crash
We could, we could burn burn
We could take it
We could we could
Take it take it in turns
Getting down
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
I'm getting down with your new vocation
I'm getting down with your cute cut wrist
I'm getting down with your kisses and cross-stitches on it
I'm getting down with it
Here's a message from my old coat pocket
My spirit's alive and I want you to know
I'm getting down with the young drunk lovers
I'm getting down with the one-way pact
I'm getting down with the city and the pity of it
I'm getting down with it
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...
On, on, on, on ah...on, on, on, on ah...

Once you call my name out
Things will never be the same
They should have never let us
Get off foot in this game
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode and
Have another episode where I let it go
As far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waitin' for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fuckin' pole vault with
Oh, shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name, it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy, buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady, aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally
Understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery
And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other?
In time we discovered that we have more in common
Then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
'Cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers
Who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives, he's gettin' dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual
Ego's aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nike's, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stompin', I been rompin'
Since Tim Dogg was hollerin' 'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin' Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet
That tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky Ticky Toc, Ticky Ticky Toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop

[Intro]
Would you prefer if I remove... MY... UHH?
Nah they. they clean.
I mean. what?
You wanna look at the bottom of...?
[Vers 1]
My shoes are clean girl, how about yours?
Here we are sitting on your living room floor
Listening to some records from your collection
Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and your as sober as Jehovah
Knocking door to door, trying to walk to road
That the Mormon's paved
If she was here on your sofa with a beer on a coaster
She'd of told 'ya that my game was way over played
Make no mistake
I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes
Girl show me leg!
So I'ma gonna trade these shoes for rollerskates
And I'ma stay happy just as long as there is a whore to pay
But some of us already spent the rent
So we can't be content until there isn't no more today
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues
[Vers 2]
My shoes are muddy girl, how about yours?
Here we are loungin' on your bedroom floor
I'm really drunk so I'm looking at your carpet like
Man, fuck the permit, I know where I'ma park tonight
It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me
They're rolling thick like they know they taking victory
But not tonight, right, I'ma make some history
Get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
Let me get to be the man of your mystery
'Cause them meddeling kids don't understand your sensitivity
Show some sympathy
Let me kiss your feet
Let's talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
If I live to see fifty, I'ma be a tipsy, dirty old man
Still following my kid beliefs
I know it isn't really your responsibility
So we'll be strait once I take a hit of Listerine
[Chorus]
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues
[Vers 3]
I can't find my shoes girl, how about yours?
Here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded, and you fell asleep
And I'm thanking God that this date was hella cheap
Sitting down, trying to keep the liquor down
Light, stars and sounds everything flickers now
Sick bound, the whole room twists around
In front of the toilet assume the position to drown
Here it comes! Whiskey out bounces all over the floor
Now I'm sitting in the bitches mound
I'm just a clown and I'm sorry I found it funny
When you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground
Didn't know you would rip your gown
Didn't think you would shout and get so loud, get so wound
Yeah I'm drunk, but I'm more than a little proud
I'm leaving, fuck the shoes you keep them, I'm getting out
[Chorus]
Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues
Perfection
Perfection
Perfection
Perfection

(You was jealous, it's all your fault) --> Milk Dee
(What's up, punk?)
(You was jealous, it's all your fault)
(Pretty soon it's a homie you're grievin)
(You was jealous, it's all your fault)
(Got beef? What a pity)
(You was jealous, it's all your fault)
[ VERSE 1: MC Eiht ]
Back for the payback, black, you came up shorter
Geah, your ass is out, Eiht wrote a-
Nother funky rap about your jealous conflict
How you diss C.M.W, boy, you ain't said shit
Your senses should tell ya: kick it, don't be a hero
Equipped to whip is Eiht, unlike a zero
I gotta hitcha, or get witcha
Sit down, clown, I commence to paint a picture
Hm, it's kinda funny, but yet somewhat amazing
Take you serious? I think about it while I'm blazing
Only then will my reaction show
How I chill and let my tempo flow
Too sorry is the name for your rap
No competition, dissin, boy, you need to be slapped
Eiht ain't no punk, so learn it quick
Oh yes, p.s., C.M.W., and you can get my duck sick
You can get the duck sick
You can get my duck sick
You can get the duck sick
[ VERSE 2: Tha Chill ]
I don't believe it, how the hell'd you get on wax?
Makin demos on your tape deck tracks
You did a show, and I heard it was wack
You tossed our records, think I tossed right back
You got the nerve, tryin to go down like a trooper
In better words, you go down like King Cooper
So stop your little dissing, saying that I can't handle
I put your lights out, you have to rap by a candle
Go head up punk, or sell out, I know you must've
Heard the word, new jack, I'm not a buster
Always down to bust a record, a party, know what I mean?
But unlike yourself, sucker, I do it for cream
So period, end of story, don't even bore
Me, Tha Chill MC, claim to gory
So that's it, the Eiht and Chill is the shit
(Chill) Word, and you can get the duck sick
You can get the duck sick
Yo, you can get my - duck sick
You can get the duck sick
Geah - get the duck sick
You can get the duck sick
Get the duck sick
Word up
You can get the duck sick
[ VERSE 3: MC Eiht ]
Wait a minute, hold up, punk, I know you're kiddin
Sayin E can't hang, you're bullshittin
I'm not a rookie, meaning a beginner
If fakin was a sin, you'd be a sinner
Load up my mic and gat, start gunnin
Fresh off the Compton streets, so start runnin
You come across like a two-bit sucker
Tryin to compare with a hard mutphafucka
Punk, they call me Eiht, so give me respect
I heard you did a show on your Mom's tape deck
Fool, you fucked up smooth tryin to diss
A victim of a violent crime on the list
So wake up and smell the bud', you little pupils
Tryin to go head up, punk, you got no scruples
Conflict you pick, you're sick
You can't fade us, but yo, you can get the E's duck sick
You can get the duck sick
Geah, you can get the E's duck sick
You can get the duck sick
School em
[ VERSE 4: Tha Chill ]
Now, who got you hip to be a rapper?
You sorry jack-ass (You punk whipper snapper)
Just take a step back, and boy, start peepin
On Eiht and Chill (Geah, ain't no sleepin)
Quiet as it's kept, the news'll spread like AIDS
Hip-Hop, C.M.W. gets paid
Always down to dunk the funk
Or clownin down a weak-ass punk
The beef you got, to Chill, don't mean shit
Just a test I have to pass to show I'm on hit
And Tha Chill's on hit, legit
With the E I don't quit
I grab a chair and a whip
Like a lion, suckers I'm tamin
Peel a cap and snap on the mic, because I'm gamin
So watch me rip, cause you suckers is on a ego tip
Stupid suckers, yo you can get Chill's duck sick
You can get the duck sick
What you say, E?
Get the duck sick
Get the duck sick
Yo, who want the duck sick now?
My man Unknown want the duck sick, E
My man DJ Slip want the duck sick
Word em up, Mike we be boomin on the boards want the duck sick
My Deejays Ant see and Mike T want the duck sick
You guys are sick

Well hello and hi there,
Never knew that you were weird like me.
Thought I was the only one
Now it seems like I'm not that lonely.
Can't believe your boy don't understand you
And it seems like you don't love it.
And I think we have more in common
So think twice.
We can be like Cosmo and Wanda
Music and lyrics.
Under these blankets and covers,
We can be like waffles and syrup.
So take my hand today
We can make now into last week,
And turn you and him to you and me so
I'll take you to a place where
You don't have to think of him
We can go wherever you want
It won't cost you a damn thing
Love don't got no price at all
If you need me
You can bet your bottom dollar
I'll be there [x3]
You can bet your bottom dollar
I'll be there
I'm seriously drawn by the way that you've been overly hurt
Because I'm always there to try to make you know what you worth
A young lady that's amazing, and you're perfect, I tell it.
From that cute poke'in bottom to them perkyish melons and you're a felon.
That smile is better than fresh pancakes
I can't believe you and your stupid man date
I know I'm saying everything too weird and really fast pace
But I just wanna cuddle your butt and give you my last name, Yeah!
Cause everyday I give you love as a deposit
I don't need a million dollar or some cash up in my wallet
To keep you up in my heart
You scrumptious I need a bite
Let's sit and watch Superbad
Eating noodles or sticky rice
And not care 'bout everybody
We'll be out on our way
You the apple of my day
The juice to my Minute Maid
With that make-up on your face
I can tell that you try
And ain't no other man better than, better than, better than
Tell me all the things that made you pissed
Am I really sprung, well a little bit
When you're down,
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there
Through every little thing that he can't do
Just keep this energy between me and you
So when you're down...
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there,
Take you to a place where
You don't have to think of him
We can go wherever you want
It won't cost you a damn thing
Love don't got no price at all
You can bet your bottom dollar

(Y'all know what this is)
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E? (MC)
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me? (Bone Thugs)
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E (The lil' homeboy Bow Wow)
Boy, if ya wanna make it (MC)
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (What's your perspective?)
Monday we made love (I'm outta love)
Tuesday you had time (And macked it all)
We just break up again, you want me to let you back in
But tonight I'm like no, oh, uh, uh, uh, oh
My mind says no, but my body and soul said yes
I hate this mess, boy, you just ain't no good for me
This ain't the way real love should be
Took you back once, took you back twice
Took you back, three, four, five times
They said your tricks were over
Boy, you've gon' crossed the line
Took you back once, took you back twice
Took you back, three, four, five times
Can't see the love in you, somebody help me! (Krayzie, give her a little bit)
Now you look from the jump
And a nigga was thugged out, but you bugged out and start trippin'
Flippin' on me all time, and it's been like this all my life no matter how I try
Guess it's the thug in me; got my mind on my money, man
I'm spending my time on the grind tryin' to shine; I'm concentrating on running thangs
I've been tryin' to hold it down, and you steady tellin' me it's over now
She always talk loud; she always leave me but always come back around
That's just what we go through, and you know it's so true
Every time I slip up she behind me, gon' be right there to remind me...
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E? (Uh yeah, ha ha)
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E (Just a little bit)
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Layzie!)
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (Giver her a lil' bit)
Can we take a long walk on the beach, get away from the streets?
Baby girl, me and you need to rendezvous
Cancun next week, how that sound to you?
I've been meaning to spend a little time wit' you
I can tell you fed up from all of the promises I've been making lately
And I had to deliver, but I been so caught in my hustle, tryin' to make this payment
And I should've considered your feelings
I should've been better about it
I should've been grown, not childish
I should've been way more polished
But my hustle done paid off, and I'm ready to spoil you, love
Come look what ya boy gon' do (Gon' do), let me make this up to you (to you)
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Bow Wow!)
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of (Give her a little bit)
Weezy, girl, I can't believe what you sayin'
You know you got it; should meet with my fans
But every time I get a break I'm layin'
Where? In your arms all night and day playin'
You want some time, I send you Jacob
Want sunshine, then take a vacation
We ain't gon' make it if you keep complainin', everybody go through changes
Love is a (Dangerous) thing
It's full of happy and sad faces, break it up to make up later
Talk it out so it ain't no anger
We need more communication, you should have some consideration
Cause you knew from the day we met, what, what type of player you was dealing wit', ha ha
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E
Boy, if ya wanna make it (Wish!)
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit a (Give her a little bit)
Everything I do, just for me and you
Stack a little paper so it's never rainy days
I got you, but just for me, then you got to understand that I hustle, hustle
Diamonds, things, I gotta hustle, hustle; anything that brings the weight up
See, a real thug too - it's in his nature, it's in his nature
Not tryin' to say that you about that paper, but me and you, yes we like that paper
Overseas trips, diamonds on the wrists; you must admit: your boy gets that paper
I like bossin', girl, girl, but you beside me, slide wit' me, slide wit' me
Try and take it away; that's when I ride and ride
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit of ya T-I-M-E
Boy, if ya wanna make it
'Cause ya gotta give a little bit of love! (Is that what ya tellin' me?)
Oh baby, yeah (That all you need, all you need is a little bit)
If you wanna make it 'cause you gotta give a little bit of love

driving down the road i hear the radio
and your muffled screams through the back seat
i just made your shoes but they need to be
cleaned for meet and greet
so classic so smooth
as you sedated me
i slipped a little something into your drink
a potion, more like a poision
i tell you as you drive on
brake lights shine through black
they reveal the burial plot
one last kiss before your final send off
you take my final breaths
thrust them into the ocean
cement shoes
i shall become one with death
the air bubbles start to surface
a sensation of satisfaction sweeps over my entire body
content with the done deal
the taste of this victory is almost to much for me
don't forget i killed you
with my death that i home brewed
as i sink down i remember what the sea king said
"you die here"
the chemicals begin to mix
vision begins to blur
i fall to my knees
i am my own victim
i was meant this way either way
you tapped my phones
i made the set up
it was meant to be Neptune's plan
no fate involved

As I develop the awakening mind
I praise the Buddhas as they shine
I bow before you as I travel my path
To join your ranks, I make my full-time task
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
Respect to Shantideva and all the others
Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here that's not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too
If others disrespect me or give me flak
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So we can work to release them until they're cleared
Therefore, it only makes sense
To thank our enemies despite their intent
The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth
With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good for all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To try to make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
I vow to do my best, to do no harm
And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma
And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara

I wake up-wake up in the morning,
'Cause them boys come knocking in the morning,
Then I have me girl go flush in the toilet,
Them say did someone get murdered on the corner?
Them say did someone see me, seen someone get shot,
Them say they saw me there
My nigga they won't break me, man I'll go crazy,
Before they make me tell
[Chorus]
There was a murder by the corner house, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
Them boys asking questions now, no-no-no-no-no.
Now everybody seen it, but don't nobody know,
What happened to the boy down the street a week ago,
Ain't nobody talking, they keep it on the low,
Don't open ya mouth, when they knocking at ya do'
'Cause niggas die out here for snitching,
they dying for snitching, O-K!
These niggas die out here for snitching,
they dying for snitching, O-K!
Those who break the code, we dig them hole.
What's worse than a street nigga that sells his soul?
Via the life we chose, we picked our roles,
Bad man stands some fall but never fold.
Gangster turn informer when the jig's up,
Ya tool mix-up mix-up,
Babylon boys, get bodies left for pick-up.
Blood puddle, gun muffle, guns couple,
Muzzle in mouth, we bring trouble.
Soon police come rush, whole family crushed,
All because them pussies couldn't hush.
Shot box mouths with no covers,
Body 'pon body gets stacked, one top th'other.
Wish 'em Hell they suffer.
[Chorus]
Nobody seen nothing, heard nothing,
They ain't said a word.
Just chalk and yellow tape, with blood 'pon them shirt.
Ashes to ashes his body back to the Earth,
That casket drop six feet, then throw upon it dirt.
"Mum's the word", that's hustler's etiquette,
Ya rather hang yourself, than turn state evidence
Ever since, I was young, never talk to the folk,
Tongue small like a rudder, yet steer the 'ole boat!
Loose lip the reason that ship no longer float,
Telling the Feds everything they wanna know,
That fatal blow took his very last breath,
The power of ya tongue, is life-and-death, ya feel me?
[Chorus]

Yeah
Your smile
I wanna take it back baby
Away back
This is the for you slow
This places jumping
I`m feeling ready
The lights are dancing
The climates sexy
Oh do you feel it too
Let it take over you
Do watch you wanna do
I`m gonna rock with you
You won't be singled out
Everybody's V.I.P.
Request your favorite song
And let it set you free
Excite your soul
You believe its supernatural
Just pull up close
And explore anythings possible
[Chorus]
DJ dont stop the music
I can feel it take it over
You can stroke get in to it
And bang like we used to
Just involve yourself
Have drinks hit the floor get your money
Think of nothing else
Living the life of someone that worry free
Congregating, anticipating, a hot situation
Bodies embracing
Move with intensity
Hold on as we proceed
Release the pressure to
Your curiosity
Be ambitious
Expression inner G
Stop the madness
And let it set you free
Excite your soul
You believe its supernatural
Just pull up close
And explore anythings possible
[Chorus]
Let this music indulge
Revolve all around you
Let this feeling consume you
Misdivide every part of you
Wait her first, wait and communicate
Connect, celebrate, anticipate, appreciate
We`re on the same page
This must be synergy
Slide right up on it for me
And let it set you free
Excite your soul
You believe its supernatural
Just pull up close
And explore anythings possible
[Chorus]

Even though I wanna put the smash down I wanna take my time, I'm tryna peep you out
Where is this goin?
Where is this goin to?
Maybe you and me can be an item, but ain't no guarantees you wanna tide of
Where is this goin? (oh baby)
Where is this goin to?
Somethings on my mind girl, I'm tryna get over this madness, my heart is filled with sadness
I need your minds with habit
Ain't no rush, what to do, I wanna get to know you
Cause when I've lied of things I told you, but I think it's time I show you
Where is this goin?
Where is this goin to? x4

Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah
That's right
Gotta get off the phone, bust this verse
Aight
Okay
I'm anti-imperial
Anti-trust
Anti-gun if the shit won't bust
Anti-corporate, they anti-my essence
Anti-snortin' them anti-depressants
But I'm not pro-poppin' em
I'm provocative
And pro-stoppin' them FBI operatives
Who professional at Black Man Pounce
And hand you a sentence that you can't pronounce
I'm also anti-narco, anti-vice
911 Marks the anti-christ
They anti-social, pointin' M-16's
Guess I'm anti-the-anti-nigger-machine
Proletarian, funkadelicparliamentarian
Pro-revolt-in-the-21st-centurian
Pro-running up in Congress sayin' 'fuck it all!'
But bring the people with you, that's the protocol
This beat is joyful like jailbreaks
The whole world is anti-United Snakes
So check it out, anticipate the anti-venom
And move your antibodies to this revolution rhythm
We goin' be fuckin' with 'em
Pro-union but most lost they bite
Anti-muthafuckas-crossin' a strike
Take a look around and be for or against
But you can't do shit if you ridin' the fence
Ride the fence
Now you don't really wanna
Ride the fence
Now do you really wanna
Ride the fence?
Why would you really wanna
Ride the fence
Don't ride the fence
Ride the fence
Now you don't really wanna
Ride the fence
Now do you really wanna
Ride the fence?
Why would you really wanna
Ride the fence
Don't ride the fence
I'm anti-uppin'-your-dollars-with-telekinesis
(I done tried everyday, and that shit decreases)
Anti-them-anti-crime-bill-pieces
We need cash and that's the anti-thesis
I'm pro-overthrow of the 'Hip-Hop Nation'
Pro-layin'-low-til-I'm-off-probation
Pro-people's-control-of-the-cash-and-corporations
Pro-prophylactic yet pro-creation
Anti-watered-down-drinks-in-fancy-cups
Anti-promoters-who-don't-ante-up
But I'm not anti-thug
I know that power is the most effective anti-drug
I'm pro-Zapatista
Pro-Cuba
Viva
Pro-la raza sayin' 'fuck la migra!'
Policia se asesina
Lemme show you what I mean
I'm anti-republican and democratic
If they self-destruct
That's anti-climactic
Tired of bein' hunted like an antelope
Take the system by the throat
That's the antidote
So I pose a proposition
Take a look, be in support or opposition
Then be proactive proceed with confidence
'Cause you know that you can't change shit by ridin' the fence

Wait a minute motherfucker

French Montana ft Uncle Murda, Torch - Ghetto Boy

Well if you thrust, eventually you gonna gush
And I'm implyin' I ain't had no business cryin'
'Cause we used the rubber twice
And we knew that shit was dyin' to bust
Well, we was only seventeen
But you was older in between
And in my fresh Adidas fits
I used to come more clean than Jeru
Jerkin' off in a can of chlorine
Sophisticated with the game I was spittin' in
A nymphomaniac was with it
That's just a clip, more experience
Be on my chest when I was put to the test
You said, "Goddamn nigga, that ain't how ya get it in"
Dashboards for the leverage
Tall cans for beverage
The weed can make you courageous
Make a Honda Civic seem so spacious
Make five minutes seem like ages, anyway
You smelled like care-free curl and nowalaters, baby
Said you liked high-top fades and Jesse Johnson's crazy
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much, today I'm still campaignin'
The lake don't smell so bad now, do it
Don't trip off ya hair, baby, just re-glue it
The windows is fogged up, can't nobody view it?
Put down the O E and turn up the Howard Hewett
And some more, we had things to discuss
Like how we do it, we got amniotic fluid
And a baby floatin' though it
Hey, imagine if it look like us
It was me up in the vaginary
And I'ma love my kids whether real or imaginary
Quit school, work well depends at the mall
Next to Fashion Berry, operation cash and carry
Manual labor from six to noon
Makin' six kabooms
Got a baby that's fixin' to bloom
And he befits the groom plus grips the spoon
So let me twist the ploom
And inhale and emit the fumes
You smelled like care-free curl and nowalaters, baby
Said you liked high-top fades and Jesse Johnson's crazy
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much, today I'm still campaignin'
I was composed, I didn't even crack a frown
I was supposed to let my parents fall down
And show my ass when I found that the baby was
Four months early and around ten pounds
I heard a lot of bad things about teenage mothers
From those who don't really give a fuck about life
She said, "It ain't so much that they startin' out younger
It's just they supposed to be more like a wife"
Meanin' you ain't shit without a man to guide you
If ya mama tried to feed you that she lied too
Make ya grab any motherfucker that ride through
If jobs are applied to knots can get tied too
Plus I know that you must have been scared
It made it easy when the feelings were shared
Flashback to 20/20, I know you waitin' for the dollars
'Cause you knew I had funny money
Yellin' all loud like I'ma tear the whole hood up
Don't tempt me 'cause the real daddy stood up
He said, I was a mark for believin' in you
Now it's more that I'm seein' is true
There's a few things I'd like to say in this letter
Like I wish I would've seen him grow
And ask my wife I learned to fuck much better
And thank you for lettin' me go
Yeah, thank you for lettin' me go
For real, thank you for lettin' me go
You smelled like care-free curl and nowalaters, baby
Said you liked high-top fades and Jesse Johnson's crazy
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much, today I'm still campaignin'

Hey! c'mon!
But they don't hear me though
But they don't hear me though,
But they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't
I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse
And got blood on my dick cause I fucked a corpse (c'mon!)
I'm a nasty nigga, when you pass me nigga look me in my eyes (what!)
Tell me to my fucking face that you ready to die (c'mon!)
You be a dead motherfucker, red motherfucker
Don't be stupid, you heard what I said motherfucker
Who shot you? aww nigga, like you don't know (woo!)
Sticking you for yo' dough while I'm fucking yo' broke ho (what!)
Yo! don't you get the picture? niggas can't touch me (uhh!)
Cause I don't give a fuck g, I'll get you touched b
I got choice, to rip my slug or take apart a door
And enough crazy niggas behind me to start a war (c'mon!)
So what you want nigga? help, cause youse about to rest (uh!)
When I'm fed, red cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothing but make you look a little thicker (yea!)
Cause in the dark, you ain't nothing but a lil' nigga (what!)
And if you'd been thinking about that shit you did
You wouldn'ta brought the joint, wit you kid,
Now I'ma have to get you kid, and split your wig, wit the machete (what!)
I bring beef to niggas, and string em out, like spaghetti (c'mon!)
You ain't ready, nor can you stand how I'm bringin it (uh!)
I'm givin it is how I'm livin it so I'm swingin it (uh!)
Red dot on your head, cause youse in mid range
Red dot on your chest, opens up your rib cage
[Chorus: x4]
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
Now if your heart was as big as your mouth, you'd be real
But it's not, so I know if you get knocked, you'll squeal
Like a bitch, cause you is a bitch and always been a bitch (oh, oh, ohh!)
And you know how niggas do a bitch we run up in a bitch (ohh!)
Put something in a bitch, nigga do you know me, nigga do you owe me? (uh-huh)
Figured you could blow me? well I'ma let this trigger fill you homey
Y'all niggas gots to be smoking something thinking you chokin somethin (uhhh)
Fucking around wit me you'll be a broken something (woo!)
I'm out for 'blood' with the 'crips' at war
How much shit could you talk wit your lips on the floor?
Pussy niggas make me itch, so I scratch, youse a bitch (uh, uh, uhh)
So I snatch up your face, fake-ass pencil I scratch you (uhh, uhh, c'mon!)
Yeah there was a time, when I would of jumped up and choked this nigga
(but now!) but now I'm on some shit like, "yo, smoke this nigga!" (uh-huh!)
I'm bout to find out how much guts you got before I spill em
Somebody come and get this motherfucker before I kill him (please!)
Fresh out the asylum, I'm whyling
Y'all niggas know the phone numbers for help you best to dial em (ay!)
Nine-one-one, emergency, the urgency
Will have witnesses seeing what the surgeon see (woo!)
How far you gon' get, wit your dome split fool!
I catch your man slipping cause he think his shit cool; (c'mon)
But it ain't, so I paint the walls with his blood (uh, uh, uh)
Another dick in the mud, nigga what!!
[Chorus]
(c'mon!)
Hey yo you know who this is for
They let the dogs in the door (c'mon c'mon, yeah)
Hey yo you know who this is for.. (c'mon)
They let the dogs in the door (yeah yeah)
[Chorus: x2]
I just love

Yo, avoiding the corporate sector running with the rebel operatives
Pulling a dark saber out on hostages
Deltron O from the under city wonders will they never cease
Fear of black planet, serious heat
Here in the street high doubts and strongholds
Action adventures go beyond the globe
The lost ones mobbing in repulsive trucks
Transporting troops and not for sport
My measurement systems are pleasant for listening
Imperial decree that legalizes conditions in certain instances
Battle techniques require split second timing
The usage designed with large spacecrafts in mind highly maneuverable
Turbo lasers will do more than subdue them fools
Provincial governor peripheral cameras cover
Every corner and crevice I catch a glimpse at
Deltron is our hero, if he can't do it nobody can, with the wave of a hand and a flick of the wrist word wizardry will certainly give you a glimpse
(x2)
Yo attack on my research station on the coast of my private continent
They can't sway my confidence
With bloated, sugar-coated nonsense
Despite the strong sense of honor
It was I that assassinated the rhyme twat
Bombs drop cutting him off
Plus winning support from the people for what I have thought
A constant remembrance
The emblem with the heiro- insignia kept ruffling in the wind
They diminishing
Strength and size
Emphasize three eyes
Even in these bleak times
I'll be sure to speak my mind
Cause it ain't illegal yet
The thought process
Fools lost in a time warp wishing for the final course
Cross reference the alien amenities
Vector technologies and the prison facilities
Discovery of the plans were really what he had sought
Put lovers of the new order on their luxury yachts
Served as a commander for hip-hop's elite fleets
Planets of the galaxy understood my feats
Deltron is our hero, if he can't do it nobody can, with the wave of a hand and a flick of the wrist word wizardry will certainly give you a glimpse
(x2)
Deltron is our hero, if he can't do it nobody can, with the wave of a hand and a flick of the wrist word wizardry will certainly give you a glimpse
(x2)
All biological chemical scramblers
Electromagnetic probes taking a gander
Incredible stratagems for millennia
Kept my folks in with love we still defending em
The realist path prevents most from killing each other
But still something suggested undercover
Guidelines with interactions taking precedent
Primary news agencies leaking the evidence
Semi-precious stones hoarded at home
Since the great collapse finance has taken back
Now the crime wave by the mind slaves
Got the populous trying to escape
To a new planet flying in space
Interplanetary officials secretive and aloof
Created a capitalist move to overshoot
The chaos and effectively cashout as they lost
Issuing the galactic civil war to keep the days long
The surest options? neurotoxins
Erase the data file to the central computer and stop it

[verse 1]
It's one of those nights girl
You know just what I need I don't have to spell it out you bring out the freak in me ooh something
Terrible I'm getting sweaty right now so
[chorus]
Please come touch me (yeah)
I need it right now so do what you do and please me (alright) kiss me right there baby nice and slow
[verse 2]

I got a house on a hill right next to Jay-Z
And girl I am trying to put you in it
I want lay your body down on the California ?
Girl let me feel it
Let me ? that stress girl clear your mind
If there is a problem you know I deal with it
Just wanna barrow you for the rest of your life
Girl let me know if you're with it
[Chorus]
I know it ain't no price on your ? I was able to ? that
Cause when they see me in the hood when I got you baby like ?
? baby I need you on my arm
Like a need a fly shirt with a big ? to match
And I need you in my ?
Like a Luis ? with a matching ? on my back
You are my favorite outfit
You are my favorite outfit
I got that showroom ? sitting on ?
Shorty want to take a ride up the coast
And everywhere we go girl see the flashing lights
? bigger and better than most
Let me put that lotion on your back
? and then later on let me get that back
While you're screaming Bobby V you are my man
[Chorus]
You remind me of my hat
Cause you're always on my mind
My women are like my shoes I can get lower ?
Girl you fit me perfect I can wait to ?
Everybody want you like the kevels ? can't afford you
? so leave me these are lame
? all they do is ? all I do is ? Christian Dior you
? I don't waste time
Chorus

"Oh, whaddya know? He comes."
[Posdonus]
Down, like water, fresh out the clouds, clown.
Drown you like terrible weather.
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon.
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'.
To all - rise and shine; give God the glory.
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory,
And still got bills and employees to pay.
So excuse me, Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days.
My ways of control is hard to swallow.
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind.
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine.
Dis-play your indie, but say no more or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo.
To the dirt, and edit the clip and lost Kano.
My mens wear problems like Timbs.
See it all in they face; ask Mase, he got wars to win,
Scores to settle, crews to crush.
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile.
It's Long Isle y'all; longevity sustainin' my celebrity status.
From A-M to P-M, you see him on file, y'all.
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right.
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop,
Shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light.
"A few short words, and whaddya know?"
"Oh, whaddya know? He comes."
[Dave]
Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls; here's my back, stiff, straight up.
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic.
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop.
Top drama every time these commas don't drop.
Pop spots like lint on your shirt; the net worth.
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball;
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six.
I circumcise the track; you just a dick, overlapped and hooded.
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John.
I repeat like yesterday; it don't stop.
George of this poor life, pop, put to Scarlet;
In a place she believes much better than your lies.
She say she lookin' better in my eyes; bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck.
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby.
I tried to speak my piece in court, but Judge Mills paused me.
Bifocusedly die, hopeless sometimes.
Yo, cry your poker face; you oughta try it one time.
When God is an non pos' you stand to download.
Demanded like slaves on trial; we want free.
Man, cock aim ready; it's time you MC.
So you rappers bust bibi guns; graffiti runs
Through my veins, since cable with the wired remote.
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float.
[Ghostface Killah]
C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul.
We was rhymin' through the frozen street since eight years old.
Take us back to eighty-eight; you couldn't catch our flow.
A group of kids so original.
[Ghostface Killah]
You heard?
[Ghostface Killah]
Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners; who got 'em?
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew and his whack dancers.
Bitin' is forbidden, pah, pay that tax.
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back.
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men.
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in.
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn.
Hula hoop all bitches; crew full with brand new Keds.
Cutmaster kill 'em; make sure we cut classics.
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets.
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the P-A,
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads, and snatch a dude's toupee.
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n A-J,
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed, like a glass of O-J.
Girls, you can go cruisin' in my O-J.
"A few short words, and whaddya know?"
"Oh, whaddya know? He comes."

Cold day in the summer right when you think that it's over
That's when niggas put you under, yeah, the inner city weather
With crooks is always ready, you should walk around with toolies tucked inside they belly bellys
Had a cousin made me lookout to make sure no one was looking
Put the stash in the bag, stash the bag in the bushes
Didn't want me there no either
Fuck rules, took jewels, ran by hood procedures so spring
He flagging at his granny house just to stay fresh, didn't want that, no hand-me-downs
The cost of that drama, so money flow, lil' gold plus a couple baby mommas
Yeah, go there like snow there
Brand new whips and robbing slowly
Pour them boys in the neighborhood they know me
Whips too nice, they might be stolen
He gotta be rolling, you gotta be kidding
On a social ride, nigga, you gotta be sniffing
Only thing inside was a CD with the name on it
Let it slide but the next guy might just put the blame on him
Nothing changed on that block we used to run one up
Some heads left and a few more houses boarded up
They needed more than luck but they seem to crack a summertime smile
And this city more than rough


I got they heads turnin',
everybody's watching.
Twenty-three's glistening,
Chromed out, flossin'.
Mic on my chest,
I don't need to wear a t-shirt
Hoes lookin' at me like they trying to do some research
Hoe, you don't know me
Break me off a Kit-Kat
Titties in my lap
Baby, you can take a quick nap,
'Cause I could play with titties all day (All Day)
Yeah I could play with titties all day (All Day)
Pocket full of hydro,
hand full of drugs
Bottle in my bag
Let's have some fun
Diamond on my neck,
so you know I'm fresh.
Got a brand new car
With a brand new check.
Rims be shining,
girls be jockin',
I could fuck hoes with that,
No problem.
I'm a Crunk Kid biatch,
No doubt,
Put your motherfucking hands in the sky
and bounce
[Chorus]
I'm at the club,
Post it up
Sippin' on goose,
got girls looking at me like they trying to get loose, like
Whatcha Want?
Tell me whatcha want
Whatcha Want?
Tell me whatcha want girl.
We drink straight,
Don't need no chase.
At the beach, Spring break,
Californians in my face like,
Whatcha want?
Tell me whatcha want
Whatcha want?
Tell me whatcha want girl
Tell me whatcha want girl. [x2]
You know my name,
I'm Phat J.
Lookin' real good,
so the ladies say
When I walk up in the club
And the ice be flossin',
Steel on my face,
cause paparazzi's watching.
Everybody loves me
Like Mr. T
Suck it like a lemon,
baby give it a squeeze.
The ladies scream when they hear my band,
and the haters start shit cause they know they can.
(Motherfucker)
You's a hater,
You's a hater,
Sorry, but this can't work out
In your favor
And my behavior is always wild
People love me 'cause
I got the cue white boy style.
Don't be jealous
Clothes highly developed.
And you don't need to tell us,
we already know.
We got the gangsta flow.
And you know we rock this
B-C-1-3 Motherfucker,
can't stop this.
[Chorus]
I'm at the club,
Post it up
Sippin' on goose,
got girls looking at me like they trying to get loose, like
Whatcha Want?
Tell me whatcha want
Whatcha Want?
Tell me whatcha want girl.
We drink straight,
Don't need no chase.
At the beach, Spring break,
Californians in my face like,
Whatcha want?
Tell me whatcha want
Whatcha want?
Tell me whatcha want girl
Tell me whatcha want girl. [x2]

[Swizz Beatz]
Double are
Right Now
We ain't playin' wit y'all
We ain't playin' wit y'all
Stop playin' Drag
[Drag-On]
A-yo I spit these bars to make ya head shake
Fuck bitches 'til the bed break
Let's see how much lead you can take
Never let a nigga pay for what I give away
We can all share
Clip to my waist it's all spare
So run dammit, run
When I bust my gun
I miss none
Put y'all in critical condition
I'm the talk of the town when it comes to fuckin' bitches
Or layin' niggas down
Drag bust the most rounds
While y'all niggas dibble and dabble
The shit I pull up wit
It'll feel like it grabs you
We ain't fuckin' I had you
Shit I know Drag'll be glad to
If I had to
Soon as she in the bathroom
I'm in her ass too
Gotta six shot shooter
That'll pop through ya
Glock ruger
In case I call my block movers
State troopers on my ass
Shit let me see them touch 160 on the dash
My Z look pretty when it's fast
I bet 50 I'ma juice the city before I pass
And if you want to catch fire better step on the gas
The opposite of H2O
Want to be a hero
When the fires on
Y'all won't even see ya moms
Even if she was screamin' at the top of her lungs
Niggas either burn to the bone or leave the shit alone
In case of a fire never take the elevator
Walk 2 flights hold ya breath and take the steps (Uhh)
[Chorus: Swizz Beats]
Do my ladies run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my ballers run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my mamis run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my dogs run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
[Drag-On]
A-yo I only fuck bitches that's flexible
Ankle touch neck sex incredible
When Drag about to spark cats
Ain't no barging wit that
When my gun spit it say "Where The Target At?"
'cause I'm fire so I speaks wit heat
So let me walk that walk
'cause like a teacher I'ma talk wit chalk
That'll outline y'all like a fresh pair of Nikes
Stay wit those
Even if I'm bare toed you see the stripe
I leave blood stains on sponges
Cum stains on comforters
I leave rooms foggy
'Til where y'all can't find me
Keep a bad mami
Twisting up the green scent
Like tangerine face out of a magazine
Like ebony
On the block I pump the ivory
Never pay for show
I only fuck wit those that never ate before
That means no food, no cars and just skip bail
The only thing on they plate is no more than fish scale
The blow you only know about is the air outside
I have nightmares before I sleep I pray y'all fry
For a pie I lay out guys
'cause what I keeps layin' on my dresser
Keeps layin' niggas on top of stretchers
Lightweight but I give off pressure in all measures
Never chase treasures
Flame niggas for pleasure
Red/Gold vest
Bullets go through tef
Got better double are
2 letter (Nigga)

Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)
Tone Starks (Peace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waiting)
But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care
Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK
You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
'Cause this is love, it gotta be love
Love at first sight
Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK, any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK

(Intro - Biz Markie)
A-one two
Okay, Okay, O-O-O-O-Okay
Paul Nice and the MC (Biz Markie)
We're getting down to the funky sounds
And check it out, here's how you do it
(Verse 1 - Biz Markie)
Y'all know me, as the B-I-Z
That rock the microphone most definitely
Bringing you styles that you never heard
Liked by the thugs, liked by the nerds
I'm real super, hot in the eighties
Even Austin Powers'd say "Yeah baby"
The hip-hopper, unpredictable showstopper
Whatever I say, you know it's proper
When I kick it, I kick it like a field goal
Like Eric B & Rakim, you know I got soul
I got funky rhymes to blow your mind
Funking you out, without a doubt, Aries is my sign
I'm cookoo for cocoa with my vocal
When I'm in San Francisco or when I'm local
The Emmazah, Emmazah, just doing my thing
I'm guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
(Chorus)
La da da, la da da da (I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn tha party out)
La da da, la da da da (The magnificent Biz Markie) (wooo)
La da da, la da da da (I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn tha party out)
La da da, la da da da (All the party people say "isn't he something?")
(Verse 2 - Biz Markie)
Biz in charge and, yo I'm livin large and
Oooh I like it like El Debarge and
In the tune I can croon with a bang and a boom
So hurry up and get the six smokers out the room
Before I catch Asthma or Emphysema
You can catch me in a playsport or a beamer
I rip and rag, play freeze tag
But since I got older, it's all such a drag
But it don't matter now like Purina cat chow
The first beat I did was meow, meow, meow
Don't have a son or daughter even though I oughta
Its almost ten years since I rocked at the quarters
Roof top, Roseland, ooh baby what a man
Now I play the tunnel ??? in a grand
Yo Paul (yeah, yeah) let the music cease
When I count to three everybody say peace
Chorus
(cutting and scratching of various Biz phrases)

Can we try to make up for the Lonely Daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay
Sit back relax your mind your dinner is waiting
The more I see you girl my heart beat is pacing
New lovers mentally we knew what we were thinking
No waiting all night long let's start the love making
Can we try....
[Chorus]
('Cause I love you)
(I'm gonna make you stay)

Sit back relax your mind your dinner is waiting

No waiting all night long let's start the love making
Can we try....
One chance is all I need to have you forever
I'll wait forever girl until the 12th of never
If I could do it all I'd carry your baby...nine months long
But I'm a man no doubt darlin'
And you are my lady
[Chorus]
(Can we try)
(To make up for the lonely daze)

A Plus:
You don't have to worry any longer. . .
Yo wait a damn minute
Listen to the way the man spin it
Even with improper diction
I split in & gets ends
I'm lettin' suckas know
I'm fin ta buck a bro
The nigga figga he can dust a pro
Fessional I test a fool
I get a tool
And beat him wit it
He didn't see me wit it
And this is what I'ma do
Tie the crime to you
Niggas need to find a new rhyme to do
I remember when I used to grind a few
Indo sacks at my wack Sr. High School
But I told the Dean 'Bye fool.'
I graduated
He was a man I hated
And I'm glad I made it
Hie-ro
I know
You know
Fools know, that my crew's so
Phat, and niggas try to jack
Then I know they got my back
A-Plus must bust the wack.
Casual:
I'm fed up with the wackness and this weak shit
So peep the style and learn how to freak shit
I hope, ya, learn how ta cope
By the time you peep this shit here,
I'll be three times doper
Yeah, this is for the trendy G's
To ya bitches, & High School enemies
All the hoes
Shoot me to the left & shit
Cause my financial state was on defecit
But I,
Really didn't trip
Now I'm livin' phatter
And then niggas don't matter
A lot a rappers try frontin' on me
Bet they ain't got nuttin' on me
And ain't no way that buck can harm me
I turn the mouths of MCs into molecules
Niggas locked onto me like my follicles
I swallow fools with no regurgitaion
We hurt ya face, men
When ya placed in my path.
[BRIDGE]
Del:
I bust asses
Ya slow like molasses
As this continues
Then you know the fastest
Computing, looting, I gets the root of things
Bitches with problems
I leave ya jaw numb
I slap hoes
My rap flows along
With the flow of the song
As I flow on the bong
I use Jedi mind tricks
To find tricks
Bind tricks, tie them up
Then I try and phuck then they die
And what do I care?
I dare hoes
And prepare flows cause I never spare those lives
Who strives
With knives & slice
I parylize ya twice
With fear
Del is nice to your ears.
Snupe:
Not of hardest, artists going far
Jack off from Jupiter
Because I'm shooting for the stars
I'm a mack
Never come wack
Gimme a 30 second snippit
I'll rip it
Because the shit gets deeper
Creep ya ass as the floor rocks
We got the beat hittin' hard like four cops
Shorts out my last record
I write my rhymes nekkid
Let me give you a tip
I'm on the balls
So just expect it
My rep gets phatter thinkin' about those kids
They tried to step and got phucked like they momma did
By the Mr. Mostskill
I did ya hoe, still
She's askin' for waxin' and taxin' cause she heard a hoe squeal
Hoes I'm, getting more plays than Showtime
The demon got ya screamin' with no shine
No time for regular run of the the mill
I'm packin' with steel boy soldiers
Never no more the soul soldier.
[BRIDGE]

"Where's the fucking money, shit head!"
Yo, fucking Paulie Trybe, man
Get your muthafucking hand out her asshole
We gotta go, fam', we gotta go, kid
Yo, get the whip, get the whip!
I'll take 21st Century poets that's for a thousand
Curly hair or Nubian women get me aroused
To the point I wanna gamble it all
I was smashing from the back
She put her hands on the wall
She couldn't take the thrust
Only lust like a fiend for the dust
Or the pizza from Pezzi, perfect
Want to sleep with the crust
Or the 740 Alpina, leather seats is a must
And my shorty holding a nina
Rolling green in a dutch!
Bronsolini, organically I rise to paper
In the purest form, lyrically derived from nature
Like the Amazon, put your cameras on
Watch this muthafucka turn into an animal!
Light stubble, rock the muzzle like Hannibal
Jump off the top of the boat into a cannonball
Hoes with gold teeth, we off the coast of Greece
In under 3 seconds, muthafucka load the piece
Kid, the bag of money coming with me
You muthafucka
The bag of money coming with me
Yeah, the bag of money's coming with me
Muthafucka you
Surprise! Lauren is in the house
I eat fowl birds and keep a hen inside my mouth
Always extra, guest featuring with Dr. Lecter
Like Bald Head Slick, I hold my mic like a scepter
Rest in peace, Guru, son I rep Q-U
Chains on chunk
They looking at me like "who you?!"
These handmade Cubans probably fucking up my posture
Pesto sauce properly drizzled upon my pasta
No imposter, son I'm authentic
Around drugs so much, I'm probably raw scented
Bag of money dips, triceps is all dented
Precise painting pictures
Think about life and then I pen it
Nike Air extraordinaire, it's a cold world, prepare
That's what it is, dad
Winterize your vehicle
I love kicks like Action Bronson loves a reefer pull
Peace to good, bad girls that let us both sleep with you
The bag of bitches coming with me
Word up, son, all the bitches coming with me
Yeah, yo, the bag of bitches coming with me
We go raw son, all the bitches coming with me!
We making babies tonight, nigga
Yeah, smoke what you want, sniff what you want
You wanna have five daddies, you ever have five daddies before?
Ayo, 2010, got 'em buzzing like a beeper
Round table discussion
Conference in Geneva
Leaders at the table, poly over nasal
Forty seven minutes since the time I lit the basil
My rhymes are carte blanche
Liver than the Oscars
Extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the pasta
Fry the bacon, make it sizzle for the chazers
Honor in this thing of ours
Living like the mobsters
Compliments go to the chef and that's the real
My crew of goonies in the joint
We need some extra veal
You know the Caddy got an extra wheel
And if I'm ever in a pickle, I can hand a fucking Tek to Steele
Take aim and knock an apple off your head
And I'm a play like Polamalu
You get tackled for the bread
We're running in your crib
Your shorty shackled to the bed
Money laying on the Persian
Leaking plasma from the lead
And it's on!
The bag of money's coming with me, muthafucka
(It's all coming with us, nah I mean?
Outdoorsmen!)
Queens, kid, the bag of money's coming with me
Uptown connection, you fucking pussy
(Word up, man, It's all marvel
Y'all niggas know everything is marvel)
Bronsonlini, Bronsolovski, Team Facelift
(Everything we drink, everything we smoke
Everything we buy, everything we sell
It's all marvel!)
My muthafucking man Shaz
Paulie Trybe, Paulie Walnuts
(Action Marvel, Meyhem Marvel, nah I mean?)
Machine, Fonda, Tommy Guns
(Tommy Marvel, Marvel is everybody's middle name we fuck with
Meyhem Marvel Lauren, it's all marvel
The bag of money's coming with us)

Caught Up
[Verse 1]
Man I'm caught up between the two
I don't know what to do
Should I be honest (or should I be)
And to tell'em both the truth (what should I do)
And I know they know each other I know (that is wrong)
But I can't fight my feelings no more
And she don't know that you be riding this horse, Polo
Begging me to hit it raw I be like "no no"
And when i'm with shawty I be texting at the same time
Have her best friend all night hittin' my main line
I wish i could fuck'em at the same time
Got em both strippin' for a nigga on the FaceTime
And if they, find out, about this
I know that they gon' be trippin'
Gotta play, it cool
Or both of these bitches might kill me
[Hook]
Way too real
Can't let'em find out, let'em find out
It's gon' get real
(it's about to go down)
And if I had it my way I'd have both of em, that real
(If I had it my way)
Just me and my two bad bitches on the side that real
(Me and my two bad bitches)
Shits about to get real (it's about to get real) (turnup)
(it's about to get real)
[Verse 2]
Now the whole time my nigga had a girlfriend
But I'm still fucking off with her best friend
Man I can't even stay away from her
That's cause a nigga really love her
Then she wanna be my main lady
But she can't be my main lady (why)
And I know this gon' sound shady (what)
But my other girl 'bout to have my baby (turnup)
And my other girl know about us
Damn, now I know I'm in some shit (goddamn)
She went through my phone last night (last night)
And saw all them naked pictures that you sent
And now she's crazy, crazy
Talkin' 'bout how she gon' kill me and that bitch
I'm like "come on baby, baby" (I love everything about you)
She think I'll go crazy 'cuse that's my thing

For every opportunity we squeeze de last drop
Seeds sown inna de past and now we're reaping de crop
Yer, spreading de roots an we're no longer under-ground
Those dat turned away are now turning around
Homebeats and high-hats mightier than de sword
Version excursions an breaks from abroad
Too many secret histories dat have never been told
Reveal hidden agendas
Remove de blindfold
Examine de story before you tek de stage
Unscramble freaktalk displayed pon de front page
Frequency flashing synchronised like strobe
Can't do it alone you need to get into de collective mode
Need to get into de collective mode
We're taking note of every brand new sound
Keeping our minds open
Cor we know we're future bound
Together we must recognise the signs of our times
Together we must learn to read between the lines
Make your own programme
No bother become digital captive
You need some audio
So you must be active
Get into collective mode
Spirits become positive
You live de life you love
An you love the life you give
No-one is an island whether you like it or not
All inna di same boat which is about to be rocked
Warning light flashing synchronised like strobe
Can't do it alone you need to get into de collective mode
Do you spend too much time living inside your head
Worry too much about what the other man said
Need to pay heed to dis sonic reflection
Turn dis disconnection into interconnection
And get into de collective mode

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time
[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
Middle fingers up!
[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(Motherfucker)
Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up, throw it up
Cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way,
Let's take it a notch up, take it up
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, I made up in my mind
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doing things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me see you one more time
[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
Middle fingers up!
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?
"Ease up there baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap
shitting on you, holy crap
[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
Middle fingers up!
[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Here's to the mountains, yeah here's to the room
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me

Chillin' in the club in my b-boy stance
With my hoodie on and my gun in my pants
Yeah
Okay
I'm ready to get my drink on, on this one
Let's go
[Chorus: x2]
Chillin' in the club in my b-boy stance
With my hoodie on and my gun in my pants
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
I'm fresh to death, dressed to impress
Fresh for real, nigga dressed to kill
I'm the best for real, I was blessed with skill
The FS in my necklace still
I'm a threat for real, I come at niggas necks for real
Tryna build my success got me stressed for real
I'ma gain my respect cause I'm extra real
And I'm extra fly, you just extra high
If it wasn't for them drugs, you'd be extra shy
Knowin' if I throw them slugs you gon' testify
F' the extra shit, get an extra clip
I get some extra lip, just expect to die
I'll put a whole in your head, cause I hold bread
And my lawyer Johnny Cochran old head
Clappin' a pound, he ain't pattin' me down
And I stay strapped man I got my gat on me now
[Chorus: x2]
I get it poppin' on the block like a B-Boy
If you cop a couple of rocks you get a free boy
You could take a couple of shots and get a key loy
If you try to take what I got, a stick me boy
See boy tryna fuck around with me boy
Your wrist like fuckin' a bitch with no see boy
I'm a gee boy, get smoked by the P boy
Coke by the key boy, got dope and the E boy
Me boy, I'm bout to take the industry over
Lifes a war, we was meant to be soldiers
I sat back for years and watched rap cats pretend to be Hova
Pretend to be BIG, pretend to be Pac, pretend to be hot
But all that pretendin' gon' eventually stop
And the slugs gonna eventually pop
Cause all the real thugs in the box or the penitentiary oxe
VIP lookin' like a penitentiary block
[Chorus: x2]
Okay, I'm fresh to death like a million bucks
My Benz got big rims and my ceilin' lift up
Dependin' on how I'm feelin' might be wheelin' the truck
Either way the chicks still on my nuts
You know what I'm sayin', I ain't playin' with them niggas that be feelin' they tough
I ain't a killa but you still will get touched
I network, sweatshirt with the hood, got the steel in the tuck
And my lil man feelin' the dutch while I chill in the cut
On my lean, chicks stealin' my stance
Chinese print on the jeans, chicks spillin' my pants
And I got the steel in my pants, don't grind on me
I can't dance I got the nine on me
The Heckler and Koch mami fresh from the box mami
Got your panani wet cause I'm fresh to the socks mami

[Chorus: x2]
Bitch I love my hood nigga, back in my hood
Them houses back up bitch we up to no good
Flier than ever, do whatever
Live this life let me spend this cheddar
Blowin' on that gonja, straight out the pound
Represent mines bitch straight uptown
Flamed up nigga every time I come around
Its the Birdman nigga got the game off the ground
Role with a chopper, ride with a gun
Doin' my thing nigga, me and my son
Just like that nigga do it like that
I'm the number one stunner bitch how you love that?
Hat stay low 250 on the glow
The new Jacob watch bitch, had to have the hoe
The water came first then it fucked up the flow
Fucked yup the dope and the coke and the dro
Bounce right back nigga had to get more
You know how we do it get the cash off the flow
Every nigga in my hood took that loss
I made other niggas neighborhoods pay that cost
[Chorus: x2]
Bubbly chrissy, shes so with me
Ride so fly nigga, the hood all in me
Till I die these niggas goin' feel me

Straight up blood thats my love
Agreed to the 17th, we came up tough
Crab in a bucket, uptown fuck it
If I pull this motherfucker I'ma pop this motherfucker
Love my hood I get down for my hood
Ride for my homies out the neck of my woods
And took your haters out for one of your tomatoes
Creep up on your bitch and I'ma work it like a label
Stuntin' on them pussies, G4 nigga
Phantom and the range rover paid out nigga,
5 star hotel mommy is a model
G'd up bitch and we be drinkin' out the bottle
[Chorus: x2]
I miss my mama, love my daddy
Rode for my other brother put that nigga in a caddy
Divorced a freak but married to the game
Doing my thing bitch gettin' this change
Uptown madness, so sadness
Spend that corner everybody had to have it
Slangin' that iron, don't mind dieing
Have your whole neighborhood out cryin'
Love your life nigga if thats your son
Fuckin' with this bitch, wont have one
Lord to my hood, never leave my hood
Blood on the concrete nigga my wood
Remind ya no lie, I tell you no lie
That nigga wouldn't have died, he still would have died
The blood in my eyes wouldn't have let it ride
I watched the whole motherfuckin' neighborhood cry
[Chorus: x2]

Featuring Eminem
(uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff, and I'm still mad as hell...fuck you)
(Eminem)
I'm crazy with this razor with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed I'm crazy!
(ok I'm unloaded!) GO BEAT JAY Z!
(tell them I'm the ghostwrite form) ON DRE"S BEAT!
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk & handcuffed her ankles at the
Safe and thanked her, but I didn't take nothin
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles, 'cause I was pickin strange places to aim from
(MR: man, I bet you 50 bucks you won't jump out the window shady)
pay me
(Madd Rapper)
Psych, no way fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister 'cause I cought 'um in bed
I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin gas at your local saloco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turn signs, then run from po po
Chorus 2x
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's a bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, slim shady is CRAZY!
(Madd rapper)
Yo yo, I wish id been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I want to floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin to sell a ? my pops tryin to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad 'cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad 'cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs (GOD DAMNIT SPIKE!)
Feelin kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim shady gave me shroomz and I might trip out, like...
Fuck that slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help
(Eminem)
I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone
I'm straight viscious I hit you with plates & dishes
Leave you 8 stitches, what I'm gay 'cause I hate bitches?
Slut, don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And id still be mad at the world, even if it apoligized to me
You're hearin the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin Michael Jackson
In a little boys drawer shoppin at toy stores
Shady said it shady mean it
I stayed admitted, ill throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin pill mom, don't vaccuum!
Chorus 2x

Damn, is that bootleg
Damn, I could've swore I just saw backstabber
Damn, I gotta leave that shit alone
[shoestring]
It's your nutty nigga how you figure you can take my shit and break
Try that shit you thinkin bout and hollowpoint gone lead your wake
Cause ain't no jackin me for no green, we done no dividends
Niggers get they shit blew up, so motherfucker best a friend
Killin his so-so block, or straight up pull out his glock
He's been shot, took his knot
Left him in the parking lot
No mercy on the enemy, the bitches are ridin on flat fours
Bullet holes in they doors, squeeze that shit that blows them foes
Ghetto nappy, trigger happy so you gots to watch yo back
Can't be thuggin, hoes be buggin when they see us pull this strap
Blood is leakin, what you thinkin there's no other way around it
Searchin for some static, it's automatic bitch you hope you found it
He's been grouded six feet deep
Where he stood is wear he sleep
My hustle been lackin them grams
And ain't no worker for me gone play me cheap
We play for keeps you strike the street bitch with your head missing
When we was ballin, you was fallin headed for the kitchen
With sticky fingers, now the singers for the f-e-d
Won't do they time, but do they crime and lick these bitches feet
That boy's a pussy, but a bitch wanna play that gangsta roll
Snitchin on players, got to save us when they pockets swoll
Fuckin with the game, you be on crack with your brain
Tellin on your man, but you slip sometimes and fuckin change
Rollin on they side, in a g-ride while these niggaz slippin
Dumpin their bodies like john gotti now they mother's trippin
Hadn't been no snitch, you rottin ass bitch
Good enough to raise your child
Quick fakin wild, cause the aftermath is also foul
Cut you in half, murder your staff sit back and laugh
Cause down on dayton it's going to be a fuckin blood bath
Chorus: repeat 8x
Down on dayton it's going to be a fuckin blood bath
[bootleg]
I got more style than prison's got bricks (ain't that some shit)
My everyday is a mafia flick (let me make this quick)
I fuck more groupies than rockin roll singers (better ask my click)
Laughin like laughin hyena when killin (rippin up your shit)
Stretchin these niggas like caine when cut (strap on your nuts)
My dick is fatter than silicone butts (better ask your sluts)
I'm out for murder like niggers on bond (pullin out yo guts)
I be bootleggin like I was the don (cross me get fucked)
Treating you with stitches like doctors in clinics
(but I'm not your nurse)
Fuckin with this style ira dorsey invented (like this and first)
I'm stackin franklin's like tellers in banks (and to make shit worse)
I keep my pistols like brothers keep drinks
(here to quench your thirst)
I'm schoolin niggaz like teachers and tutors (don't be late for class)
My aim is straighter than state shooter (aiming at that ass)
I throw more blows than hookers on strips (don't drop that pass)
I'm intercepting with dances and flip (break fools like glass)
I'm so damn cold that I'm freezing the stage (hang up your coat)
I'm small but deadly like hand grenades (shoved down your throat)
I'm keepin niggers in line like feds (nuts hang like ropes)
I killed more honkies than oj than slayed (in l.a. keep)
Smokin more bud than jamaicans can roll (nigger pass that cess)
You like a leach on my dick so let go (before I snap yo neck)
I'm not steve walker though families still matter
(better check yo hoe)
Your roll is slow my bankroll is much fatter (gotta make some more)
I killed more niggaz than deadly diseases (their ain't no cure)
I prophesize like muhammad or jesus (pump pump no more)
I'm stabbin bitches like niggas with life (don't cross my staff)
Cause if you do reaper's takin your life
Blood bath on dayton ave

We keep embellishing upon the new unchartered path
Expressing what we see and how we comprehend the math
So there's enough for everyone
We gotta make it last, we gotta make it last
As I embark on life's journey from the point where I'm at
Peace to everyone, I know and who I go way back
With every pimp, every mack, every gang star, the Jack
Every hustler feeding babies anybody pro-black
Every sister raising kids without the help of a dad
Wanting for they're children all the things that they never had
All the brothers handling businesses, I know shit's hard
Waking up at 5 a.m. holding down 3 jobs
All my Rasta brethren getting insight from trees
To my brothers up in college getting PhD's
Or any other degree, even if you just reading for mental health
Feed your conscious so that your mind is free
All my people locked down for your past mistakes
Mentally and spiritually dwelling past the gates
You can change your ways, elevate today
To all recovered alcoholics chillin' up in A.A.
Every black-owned business keep doin' for self
Helpin' out the community and spreadin' the wealth
Understanding help ain't gonna come from nowhere else
Revolutionary's fakin' me and just get dealt
With head on black people got to lead the task
Educate keep learnin', got to question, ask
And let your light keep shinin' and remember the past
By any means necessary you'll be free at last
We keep embellishing upon the new unchartered path
Expressing what we see and how we comprehend the math
So there's enough for everyone
We gotta make it last, we gotta make it last
As I embark on life's journey from the point where I'm at
Peace to everybody strivin' to live right and exact
Even though anxieties try to pull you down
See your troubles as a blessing and you're homeward bound
Everybody gotta struggle, that's the way of the world
Can't develop biceps if you don't do curls
Can't achieve a garden if you never water your crops
If you never pay your dues then you don't get props
Couldn't eat a proper meal without cooking it first
Can't receive a paycheck if you don't do work
If it wasn't for the rain then the trees won't grow
When the spring came around what a site to bestow
When you face adversities, dark cloud won't last
If you never study how do you expect to pass
The grasshoppers laid around while the ants did chores
When the winter came around he was left outdoors
See the cycle keeps moving like a big machine
Evolution of the mind, soul, body and being
God'll never put up on you more than you can take
Sometimes you even gotta learn from other people's mistakes
With head on black people got to lead the task
Educate keep learnin', got to question, ask
And let your light keep shinin' and remember the past
By any means necessary you'll be free at least
We keep embellishing upon the new unchartered path
Expressing what we see and how we comprehend the math
So there's enough for everyone, we gotta make it last
We gotta make it last, we gotta make it last

(featuring Trife)
"It's alright ----- yyyyeaaaaaaaaah!" - sample
[Ghostface Killah]
Hold up, got's to boost those tray ups
Think I'm playin' pa, reach and get glazed up
Face all sprayed up, on the floor
Left side of your cheek, go ahead and pick that face up
Of course I'mma fuck with y'all niggaz, y'all pussy
Ya'll niggaz know how Pretty Tony get down
Made the potion '98, fuck an album, when I need CREAM
It's on, nigga, faggots, better check out their accountants
When I hung around broke niggaz and broke bitches
You know what that means, it equals no riches and
I can't have that, I got a lot of wizards
They spoiled, told 'em they have to move drizzers
Whatever they say, is none of their business
I do what I do, to get that spinach
Whether it's kill 'em, spray 'em, play 'em all on the streets
I wouldn't saute 'em, Ghost and Kay Slay 'em
[Chorus 2X: Ghostface Killah]
This kid about his papers, paychecks
Thinkin' you can pay me now, any bear feelings, just say it
Go 'head brother, just as fast as you front
It be an honor just to lay you down
[Trife]
Aiyo, aiyo
The first check I ever got
Son I spent it up top, blowin' a cop ---
I had 2 Cent, plus my car fare home
It wasn't even Broadway until I got those stones
I was sixteen, shit, I barely knew what a gram was
Studied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was
To get that CREAM, and serve them fiends
Around the same time my nigga Buck converged with Beans
Two way team, posted up on the benches
Wit a maggot for a stash that I kept hid under the black fences
Jakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles
I was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little
Though they switched nickels on niggaz, and pointed out bitches
In the precinct got the stichin', so they hit 'em off with something decent
Avoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin'
On point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'
[Ghostface Killah]
Faggot ass niggaz, when I ride get the fuck out the way
When I see jewels, all I know is take
I'm like a seed at a birthday party, all I want is cake
In other words, papes, sellin' herbs and tapes
Movin' birds and weight, through suburban states
God damn it, I told y'all niggaz
This is a Theodore stickup
Wake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!
[Chorus 2X]
[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, you heard what the bitch said
When we wasn't makin' too much muthafuckin' CREAM and shit
We was beatin' the shit outta niggaz
Takin' their little Summer Youth shit
Buyin' beer and weed and shit
Shakin' niggaz upside down on some cartoon shit
Change fall all out of their pockets and shit
Yellin' and tellin' the cops, fuck y'all niggaz!
This is Theodore! Bitch!

[B-Real]
You can't hide from the man with the master plan
Hunting for your head "How I Could Just Kill a Man"
Hey yo, where you at baby keep your head low, damn
Got you on the camcorder in the black minivan
You crossed line, time for the light to blind
You can run but I never be far behind
You never know when it's gonna come, paranoid
'cause the mentality is seek and destroy
Better look around before you come out your door
'cause shit catches up but you don't want no more
Only time will provide the right sign for real
You might die 'cause you hesitate to find the steel
[Chorus: x2]
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keeping on, keeping on, keep, keep, keeping on!
[Sen-Dog]
Listen up motherfuckers I got shit on my mind
The spotlight's on me and it's time to shine
I smack any brat that be jumping outta line
I smoke any fool try to diss on my rhyme
I get y'all, wearing no can't protect y'all
Wash your brain and have you infiltrate the
Same bunch of suckers that be trying to hate me
Want to take me out so they can try and replace me
Fuck what ya heard, have ya seen lately
The size of my clan is improving greatly
No one will hold 'em back, bringing the big heater
Watch a nigga run scared, faster than a cheetah
Speed of light, move faster than sound
But I'm still on they back and I'm gaining much ground
[Chorus: x2]
[B-Real]
No matter what you seen, we still smoking the green
Represent for all the people still a part of the scheme
Player haters, imitators want to roll with the team
But they fade away, hate away, all for the cream
They want to instigate ? to get a losse forget my stake?
Take advantage of the rilla, rob killa who scrapes
Cuban motherfuckers who don't know who I am
Better step aside suckers watch the heater expand
Get outta hand, see the light, you and your clan
Better scram outta here before you get slammed
I stand strong, keeping on, when I'm rolling alone
But you sorry bitches hideaway, place unknown
[Chorus: x4]

I love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Baby, get in, we fixin' to cruise till we can't
You got the drink, I got the denk, and we done stopped at the bank
Sunbeamin' this weekend; heading down that beach way
Messin' with my girl's hair; one of them games that we play
Braids bouncin' to the beat; feel me coming down the street
She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me, so
Shine up your hoopty and fall in line
Bring your honey if she's fine, and we gon' have a good time
To the outskirts of first, buzzin' off the erky jerks
Swoopin' while I puts in work; now watch me skirt
I heard 'em callin' me, but then I ball and see
'Cause if you're ballin' me you got your own set of keys
The breeze is hittin'; don't think you'll catch me strippin'
Forty Thevz Wino and gat got that back when we're dippin'
To the west coast, down south in your direction
Throwin' up the hood, cruisin'; come on, we jettin'
[Chorus]
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruisin' is made for love
Cruisin' is made for us
Come on in my lap, get in an' twist the cap
Hand him the jizz back, clowin' up the coast like that
Tangaray all nice in back seat, pete
Just do a rollin', top down, ready to hit the street
Shoulder to shoulder, turn their heads, 'cause it's a black thing
Sport in a 'vette brings me strapped; won't be no jacket
Consider that chocolate mixed with that tie
Wind be on my neck; the beach caress my thighs; now I hope he's high
Ready to get my groove on, so I'm playing teams
Know when he's feelin' me and what those feelin's be
Kinda' flossy, 'cause, Tossy; we do it on seat tip
Snuggled up, freaky dick give the drink a sip
Leaning on his chest, I feel security
Just my man and me, against the world; you understandin' me?
Cruisin' till the sunsets; yep, we'll be headin out
Dippin' through the city, me and my niggys; what I'm talkin' about
[Chorus]
Sunday afternoons in the tape deck
My woman's on the right, lookin' bomb for this trek deck
Floatin' on the freeway at a cool sixty-five
Malika rolls the top, so's I can feel that rocky mountain high, yeah
Take the wheel while I shake off this hairbrush
Yep, I'm down the bus like no one like what
Watchin' the sunset; be the flyest with the top down
Park up at the spot; I ain't gonna front; I'm tryin' to mess around
Your homies still around
Yeah, they busy though
That's all I need to know; roll up the windows, and lock the door
It's all that poppin' on that cooze got me worked up
Turn up the beat and bump in-between the seats some
Yeah, that's how we do it on the western hemisphere
All my homies be a man, 'cause ain't no pretendin'
Cruisin', feel the wind blow my braids back
Trippin off into the night, bumpin' to a fat track, yeah
[Chorus x 2]

It's Flamboyant y'all
Yeah, yeah yeah, Corleone y'all
Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded, niggaz must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
and I'ma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playin cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
after headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggaz startin to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, "Hop the fuck in"
On my face he saw the grin and said, "How much did you win?"
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggaz trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, "Yo son, I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun"
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
and then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the steel, took it off safety
cause I refuse to let these niggaz waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin, I'm feelin weak out on my feet
but before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
to one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin
Lookin tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, "Why?"
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out
and started blowin they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holdin back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it
but still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share
and all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the Jakes
but it's too late, I'm knockin on the pearly gates
Yeah, casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Yeah, it's Corleone y'all
Yeah, it's Flamboyant y'all
Big L y'all, Flamboyant baby, yeah
Big L uh
Big L yeah, it's Flamboyant y'all, yeah

Jiggy man (repeats 55 times)
everybody say yeah!

Yeah
Now here we go
Here we go (come on come on)
Now here we go
Here we go (come on come on)
Yeah
Stay strong this ain't for the faint hearted
My name's honored cause my style is insane retarded
Remain hottest from St. Marks to St. Thomas
Take game farther than the put-put planes charted
The same artist who smoke rainforest and bang hardest
My brain smartest break a nigga like a lame promise
All city like train bombers
Check out the pictures we painted (yeah)
More colorful than Kelis naked
Your skills is least debated and your album least awaited
Even Big Tigger wouldn't let you in "Tha Basement"
Face it y'all niggas face down with your legs kicking
They call your momma Roy Jones cause she raise chicken
You're "Down for the Count" like Rah Digga I'm straight spittin
Make pigeons say, "Uh uh, no they didn't!"
Yes we did so god bless the kid yo
I got my own so I never stress his no
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
Soon as we showed up I sensed nervousness
As soon as we rolled up y'all niggas burn to this
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
Soon as we showed up I sensed nervousness
As soon as we rolled up y'all niggas burn to this
Yo we send this bullet straight towards your brain
We taking over like Moors in Spain there's more to gain
Runaways get aboard the train (come on)
You can't ignore the pain (no)
When it come down like the pouring rain
Caught the Train of Thought it clanked across the raw terrain
The cold weather break your spirit like a water main
I looked in your eyes and I saw the shame
Y'all don't know that our greatness came before the chains
No you can't imagine a future where this all can change
If one of us ain't free then we all to blame
So we attack each other fighting project wars and thang
It's all the same across the board we fall for game
You wanna see through that shit then you can call my name
Kweli I chop it up like raw cocaine
I drop gems at top ten, I'm not for the fame
You wanna test and I bet you get wrecked like lost planes
Yo
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
Soon as we showed up I sensed nervousness
As soon as we rolled up y'all niggas burn to this

I rock for the purists and I rock for the players
I rock for the fellas and I rock for the ladies (come on)
I rock for the elders and I rock for the babies (yeah)
I rhyme to the sirens that cry in the night (yeah)
Live on the mic even though I've been dying to write (yeah)
Since the days of flying a kite and ridin my bike (come on)
Open my eyes and keep the prize within my line of sight (yeah)
Now cats drop out of school to get fiends high on a pipe (word)
Seem like that's the ghetto way of tryin to fight
The system thats based on trying to stop you from shinning your light
We dying in spite of getting rich
That's why I rhyme like a battle emcee
Battling the tragedies and fallacies
That be killing niggas quicker than infant mortality
They acting like whats going on now is distant reality
Behaving so casually that they become a casualty
Plus they don't wanna battle me anyway
They try to walk away but they stumble like Macy Gray
Cats hit the tunnel to rumble and say, "Hey DJ!"
Make me wonder why they call Sunday the lazy day
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
Soon as we showed up I sensed nervousness
As soon as we rolled up y'all niggas burn to this
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?

Check me out
Yeah

Yo, check this out man, we're gonna do this man.
We got 2 minutes and 20 seconds to get in and out of there.
Yo, Redman Solo, man don't get in there and start frontin' man.
Hit the vault, get the cash, don't shoot nobody. Alright?
Tom, set the detonators.
We 'bout to do this shit
P, let's do this... now!
Freeze! (E: Hands in the air!) Nobody move!
Mack-10 is packed, so don't break fool
This is a stick-up, real deal, real steel.
Full cooperation and no one gets killed. Hey security old man, don't play hero
'Cause a hero is a dead man, and a dead man is a zero.
Yo, hoe, put the loot in the money sack.
You reach for the button, and then you gettin' smacked!
Check the quotes?
Stutter, mothafucka?!
One more dumb move, P, and I'm-a buck her)
Chill, E. Listen lady, can't afford to do time.
One more slip up and your ass is mine.
I need all keys and codes to security boxes,
CDs (Jewels) plus money markets.
Chill before I bulk like the Hulk, Bruce Banner. Yo Redman Solo
What?
Spray the cameras.
All men, women and children please hit the floor.
D-Wade (watch the back door)
Time to get scratch, bring around the 560 (Time check...) Minute and fifty.
Time keeps on slippin-slippin
Come on, P, man, ya bullshittin'.
Hurry up, grab the sack and let's do this.
Pray for the Benz and haul ass like Carl Lewis
A reminder, a hero's nothin' but a sandwich, Gus.
This is ridiculous
Say another word
I'll make ya famous
I feel like Bustin' Loose!
(P's been hit)
A sharpshooter on the roof.
(Aw shit. Yo Redman, keep the money movin'...
Yo Tom J, if I ain't out in 10 seconds,
Blow this mothafucker up and everybody, why'hear me?)
You have 15 seconds to put your weapons down and come out with your hands up.
15...14...13...12...11...10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...
Let it go. (1)
Yo, we outta here.

"You out there? Louder!
Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack"
[Posdonus]
NYC gave you the ball, so how you gonna hate us?
We creators of them East coast stars
If you ask me I'll tell you there's no comp
But I'm still humble, even though I will crumble halls
Some call 'em songs, I call 'em words from me
that take long to cook
So some feel free in saying that we don't hunger for beats
Not that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat
Keep food off the mind and keep weight off the body
All you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth
And stop frowning like you hostile
You know that it's a booger rubbing up against your nostril
Nigga how you figure you can play this rap game without the backbone?
It's Maseo, Dave, Wonder Why, giving what you lack holmes
[Dave]
Hey yo prepare yourself for the Neutron, bitch!
This is eighty-six, let that neo-rap go
We present these flares to put fire to your ears
to lay smoke like rusty exhaust pipes
We run mics, let Sean run the marathon
Yo raise that money son, we raisin these kids
Get claps when curtains close, stage left
Up your stamina baby, bring some breath
SAT book smart, part ese
Loc'in like Tone, street niggas get grown
Acquire more couth before you get poofed
Or get some shells sent over to your mic booth
Excuse, my delivery, but when peace don't work
see this piece goin' work, cock aim and shoot!
It's my constitutional right to bear arms
Arms and bare hands on mics, make fans unite
Woodstock and white folks involved
Black man get on yo' job!
"Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack"
[Chorus: x2]
Let's go beat for beat, and rhymes for rhymes
(put, all, the things aside)
Just bring your beats, and bring your rhymes
(put, all, the things aside)
[Posdonus]
The heavyweight L.I. brother with no date, of expiration
On this fate on the mic, them birthday keep coming
I'm hated on by niggas I love most
So what threat could you possibly pose when I'm on your coast?
So raise your guns or your glasses
Either way there'll be a toast in the air
Markin the return of bare minimums you need to learn
Get your verbs right when you down to clap
[Dave]
See that gun powder caliber rap'll tip hats like gentlemen do
Smash tenements and skyscrapers
Bow-tie papers stacked high
Pay the resident tax or get your street sweeped
Front row, backstage or the cheap seats
I "Dodge" ricochets like "Ram" trucks, you slow poke to pull it
And I sup-pose you want to top the Billboard chart
Man I toast these rhymes and then pop like Pop-Tarts
[Chorus: x2]
"Well clap your hands to what he's doing"

This for the streets, nah this for the radio
This for the streets, nah this for the radio
This for the streets, nah this for the radio
Well it's for radio then just keep it street, well go on do it then
Nah, that ain't a problem at all my man
Got a lot of rubber bands, time to count up all my grands
Well, go on do it then put a ninth caller in
Now we got a lot of jams, we gon' play a lot of Cham
Well, go on do it then, she can say she is not a fan
Tell me she ain't got a man, plus she got a lot of damn
And she love how the Impala can
Change a bunch of colors like you lookin' at a hologram
She wanna ride off on 24's
Butterfly do's raise up, she feelin' so
Special and she like my music better slow
Tell me that I'm fin' to blow, I reply to her, "I know"
So let me break it down and do somethin' I know the ladies can feel
She say she's lovin' my style, she say she's lovin' my style
Turn on the radio and you probably hearin' nothin' but the
Chamillitary Mayne
We interruptin' this sound just to let you hear a message from me
I'm representin' the South, I'm representin' the South
And know how we get down, know we gotta keep it gutter and street
Go on do it then
I got a white girl, I call her Shady Aftermath
'Cause she love a rapper, see a nigga she gonna snatch him fast
Fine and you can't say that she don't have an ass
Plus her eyes green enough to even up and match my cash
Hispanic college girl that love to dance right after class
Pray the way she back that ass up her class she has to pass
The others bad and black, take her to the bachelor pad
Crib big yo, her man's crib is less than half of that
Call up the DJ's on your radio
They'll say Chamillionaire got a crazy flow
My radio station doesn't play it though
Say he gotta make somethin' for the ladies so
So let me break it down and do somethin' I know the ladies can feel
She say she's lovin' my style, she say she's lovin' my style
Turn on the radio and you probably hearin' nothin' but the
Chamillitary Mayne
We interruptin' this sound just to let you hear a message from me
I'm representin' the South, I'm representin' the South
And know how we get down, know we gotta keep it gutter and street
Go on do it then
Relax boy, lax boy, revenge is the sound
I've made it here, America gon' have to feel me now
Hear that bass come rumblin', boys see me actin' up
Also see that fast pyoom pyoom when I pass him up
Turn it up, tell the listeners to listen here
Listenin' here the sickest rapper in the Southern hemisphere
Yeah, keep it gutter, suckers missin' in the picture yeah
We erased them from the game, commercial rappers disappear
Call up the DJ's on your radio
They'll say Chamillionaire got a crazy flow
My radio station doesn't play it though
Say he gotta make somethin' for the ladies so
So let me break it down and do somethin' I know the ladies can feel
She say she's lovin' my style, she say she's lovin' my style
Turn on the radio and you probably hearin' nothin' but the
Chamillitary Mayne
We interruptin' this sound just to let you hear a message from me
I'm representin' the South, I'm representin' the South
And know how we get down, know we gotta keep it gutter and street
Go on do it then
Now they know the name that's running the game
Them boyz down in Houston that got the streets on lock
But just in case they slow and don't know
Somebody tell em the name, Chamillitary Mayne
Ha ha, you got a problem? Then let it be known
You got something you wanna get off your chest
Give us a call, we're taking requests
Go on do it then

[Verse 1: Don P]
Am I being forward? smell like weed, eyes lowered
Pulled up in a beamer, came up in a concord
Came up in a hand me down, now im in a tom ford

Go ahead and talk more, like Hov, im def

Plus I probably ran thru hoes than hef
Had to get right, then they gettin left
Dont hold you breath baby... unless your mouth full

Remember when I had nothin? Everybody doubtful
Now my route full, barley pulled up Miami
On my biggie flow, then im goin back to cali
In a 500 Benz, I feel like makaveli
Ridin on rims, low pro, pirelli
[Hook: Don P]
Im hit the block, do what I gotta do
All the way up, they ain't got my view

Right when you on, everybody wannna help you
Got they hand out, never gave a hand up
Went and got my bands up, now I got my brand up
Yall mad cut, kool aid to an act cup
Talkin bout ballin, but it dont really add up
Homie, better catch up.. where the money? where the whip?
Why you keep a bummy click? why ur honey, not thick?
Chick got no hips, wouldn't give her yo dick!
Tell me how you ball if you always hit a brick
Rule number 4.. you ain't bumpin no big?
Talkin bout me.. then you bumpin real big
Took a big swig, comin at the big wig
I ain't gotta prove nothin, I already did but
[Hook: Don P]

And yeah I hear um talkin but talkin bout who?
Im hit the block, do what I gotta do
[Verse 3: Don P]
I be in a foreign, everytime I pull thru
When you kill the game, they gon wanna kill you
Follow everything you do, claimin that they dont feel u
Met you one time, talkin bout the real you
Oh you REALLY knew me, you dont like the new me?
Homie keep it movin, know you canrt move me
Coulda been right here, but you rather be a groupie
100 round clips, hits lookin like a movie
Shout out to my first love, Aka, AR
And I got an AK, in the back of my new car
We done came too far, I dont care who you are
But imma hit the button if my back on the wall
I would takee the fall for my people...
Most of yall wouldn't take a call from your people
We are not equal, imma ki.. you ain't nothin but a gram cap
The weight is over, but i dont think you undertsand that

[Chorus]
Califoria ueber alles
California above all others
California ueber alles
California ueber alles
I'm your governor Pete Wilson, ya know
The baddest governor to ever grab the mic and go
Boom!
Gimme a budget and watch me hack it!
Gimme a beat and I'll show you how to jack it!
I give the rich a giant tax loophole
I leave the poor living in a poophole
At time when Aids is in a crisis
I cut health care and I raise prices
Sales tax, snack tax, excise tax
Information attack with a newspaper tax
Hit the pocket books of working families
Increase tuition at the universities
Some day I'll command all o' you
Even your kids are gonna pray to me in school
Soon I'm gonna be the president
You might remember the last one this state sent
[Chorus]
I'm so proud to know the Great Communicator
want to be known as the Great Incarcerator
I'll blow environmentalists away
And I'll be the fuhrer some day
I'll keep cuttin' Public Education
even though we rang 54th in the nation
I've got a plan for all the minorities
Send'em to the California Youth Authorities
From San Francisco Urban Elementary
to Pelican Bay State Penitentiary
There they can work for the master race
and always wear a happy face
Close your eyes, it can't happen here
Big Brother in a squad car's comin' near
Come enjoy the surf and the sun
and help California number one!
[Chorus]
Now it's 1992
Knock knock at your front door, yo guess who ?!
It's the suede denim secret police
They've come to your house for your longhaired niece
Gonna send her off to a camp
'Cause she's been accused of growing hemp
Don't worry it's only a shower
And now for your clothes here's a pretty flower
Gonna die on malathion gas
The serpent's egg has always been hatched
People starvin' and livin' in the streets
because they tried to mess with me President Pete
[Chorus]

Uh, uh, huh, yeah, dah, dah
(I'm skippin' jump shit right here)
Dah, dee, de, dee, dah, dah
Da, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, de, dee, dah, dah
It's me, big D, the psychotic neurotic
Never catch me in the street without some green exotic
Fly-ass whip, pockets stay knotted
Step outta bounds and wind up, red dotted
The socialite with the flows ya like
Overweight nigga, dressed in the clothes ya like
Probably see me in the club with some hoes ya like
And you know I put it down when it's foes to fight
Can't fuck wit'cha love if ya toes ain't right
I'm on some bullshit but yo, that's my chosen right
That's cool 'cause all I see is O's in sight
Drop shit that'll lift every nose in sight
Like I'm supposed to do, postin' boo
Make you jump around like the Holy Ghost'll do
Let the words get close to you
I'ma show you how cats sleep just like the most of you
Come on
When it comes to spittin' game, I'm the best at that
One extreme to another like sex to crack
Beatminerz and Swing do, and bless the track
And if the L's too short smoke the rest of that
I'm like Triple H flying off the ropes
Bring a smile like some coke, fresh off the boats
I make, you and your boys take off ya coats
And if ya girl talks back, get her off the soaps
I'm like fuck you, see I'ma scratch ya name
On some big wheel shit when I match the game
On the low chillin' with a hatch back in Maine
And I still run with niggas that'll snatch ya frames
Yo pardon me, you ain't catch my name?
It's D-Moody
In the Four Seasons about to make a nudie
Used to see hard times but now I see booty
And quite often be up in the loft
And fat asses, titties that are soft and greened out
So you might hear me coughin', I'll make ya dumbass an off
And I'll be the one to put the nails in ya coffin
When it comes to spittin' game, I'm the best at that
One extreme to another like sex to crack
Beatminerz and Swing do, and bless the track
And if the L's too short, smoke the rest of that
You get a smack fuckin' with this aristicrat
I'm the element that turns coke from this to that
You against me, it's like fightin' fist to bat
It's gonna be hard to smoke when your ribs get cracked
Think of that, come on if you think I'm wack
Me beatin yo' ass in a mink and hat
Bounce off from the scene in a Lincoln Nav
So motherfuckin' plush you just sink in the back
And I told you heffers before, never before
Will you see a beatmaker ever this raw?
See me in the streets stunning in a yellow Valor
Big D always leave the crowd yellin' for more
One of the flyest big niggas you will see
If you can figure that black, you will be
Overcome with a mild case of lunacy
When I drop the LP nigga you will see

Chorus -
The Lord is my light and my salvation
Whom shall I fear Lord

Gimme your nickname Chyna, last name White
Guaranteed to have your ass open first night
Bad bitch
Slanted eyes
Powdered with white

Baddest little thing in sight

Niggas started stashin' things on Mother Gasten
Hottest shit to hit the streets
Divide peeps, divide crew love

Slow leaks and niggas with false leads and nosebleeds
Vein popped, pop shells with close sales
Bitches, they noses frail

No love, no love.
Chyna White, uh uh uh
Chyna White

She said she love me when I'm gone
She miss me being home
I'm always at the studio that makes her alone
Recently she even seems to hate on all my songs
Deleted my pictures took my face up out her phone
Where did we go wrong I'm sitting here thinkin'
She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin'
Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln
Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking
I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming
It goes both ways and I was trying to get even
Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and
Just my broken weaslin', now I'm trying to ease it in
Came home late I just put the key in
It would probably be straight if she was European
She's not she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me
She hates me, I know it I kno'
She hates me, I know it for sure
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me again
She hates me, la la la
She hates me
I mean it started with the rose petal, ended with the stem
By the car, while I was thinking "Damn here we go again"
We used to hold hands and had such a deep convo
Make a few plans like you wanna go where I'mma go?
Well let's leave pronto and that's what we did
Then we yelled out Geronimo and jumped off that bridge
Had a couple kids, you can move where I live
I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did
The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul
I should have a live band preparing for my show
But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow
Now I know I ain't quite rich, but bitch I ain't broke
If she acting like a bitch, I guess we're around white folk
Forgive me if I raise my voice I won't raise a hand
But one thing I will do baby is raise my little man
She hates me, I know it I kno'
She hates me, I know it for sure
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me again
She hates me, la la la
She hates me

Bongs, blunts, and zig-zags
Bubblers, bowls, blowin out of big bags
Twist up, roll up, pack up, hit that
Scent so strong in the air, where you get that?
Afghan, Pakistan, lamb's bread, skunk

Low key blazers and green bowl packers
If Mary Jane is in the house then I'm gon' mack her

This is dedicated to everybody in the world that smoke weed
Legalize it

Eat it, use it for fibers, Aceyalone

Yo the NY City got a nigga feelin' shitty
Tryin' to make it through the struggle
Niggas bubble in the jungle selling crack by the bundles
Yo these raps might hunt you like a cat in the jungle
Spittin' lines off the humble
Make your whole team crumble, what the fuck made you fumble?
In these streets where they fuck you like the face of a demon
I repent every evening, trapped in the Eden, starvin', never eatin'
Yo I stay bleedin', while you jakes stay tryin' to take freedom
I'm like just a brother tryin' break even
Movin' through these odd days watchin' every snake breathin'
Ready to deface the [Incomprehensible] at night
I'm just tryin' to reshape the meaning of life, flowing on mics
Blowing you types off of the earth, livin' it worse, holdin' our life
Ready to burst on the first thinking he got it
Yo, the apple stays rotten
Stress rap, this applies to where we rest at
NY City full with nothing but stressed cats
That wanna test that flame of yours, but not ready
When we aim, the war's absolute retaliation against all, all for real
(Starvin' Harlem)
Yo, yo, Elohim, with the rhyme scheme and when the lyrics
Leave the mouth they look like light beams with wings
Attached to mic I say fly rhymes read between the lines
Aire Vast lines, the beat be tryin' to sex me and marry me
I'm talking white picket fence and a family of Vasts
They stand behind me, and reflect reality
Stage one- master of ceremonies and when the
Seven magnificent walked in raisin' hell to lower heaven
We explored all the crevices, brothers is mad
I wear knowledge like a third degree, burn, light the match
Put it to the rhyme book, make sure it all fits in the urn
The cream of life, beats and rhymes are butter that in which I churn
Stupid, you could say these masculine thoughts are homosexual
'Cause they blow heads like that dead clothes designer
All men were created equal, Emcees are uneven
Ask blind man Steven if he's even seen how the sunset looks
That's something you couldn't feel with a braille book
I'm hear to smack your ear drum long, so hum along
Let's communicate with rhythm, tell 'em to come along
You'll get smacked right in the kisser like Jackie Gleason
And watch sun, set it off like light decreasing, oh shit
Watch sun set it off like light decreasing
Stress rap, this applies to where we rest at
NY City full with nothing but stressed cats
That wanna test that flame of yours, but not ready
When we aim, the war's absolute retaliation against all, all for real
What's going on? Everything going wrong in the ghetto
Cops Desert Storm on blocks lettin' off and they gettin'
Off on the ease on the corner D's hop out of unmarked
V's and squeeze 'till we on our knees, we po' on ice
Put us in the freeze on the streets of bloody beasts, hoodies and fiends
I stay muddy in a sleaze with Oz's, breathin' through the vein cold
Got my whole frame froze tryin' to escape hold twist off the L
They got ice in my grill and I'm dirty and all I need is for them
To unlawfully search me, throw me in a cell, seven thirty
With thoughts hurtin', searchin' for freedom, we tryin' to get it
And we stay bleedin' hear that, one time I'll scream phoenix
Yo, it's the starvin', happy Harlem, rap magician
Chained underwater, in sixty seconds the body's missing
Snake in the grass at six feet you can hear him hissin'
I got a problem with your mouth, so I don't listen
Stress rap, you got one, I got five
You do yours, I do mine, but I'm still alive
They used to call me crazy Joe, had a bazooka
Now they can call me Batman, beyond your maneuvers
Shit, I'm Atoms Fam to the bone marrow
Fuck a soul, even God knows this body is hollow
You love New York, but New York don't love you
You're just a toy with Lucille Ball's hairdo
On the mic it's all magic and I got short sleeves
And I'm just that nice, I might let you breathe
Put a mic in front of me, and I'm gonna bless it
Hummingbird style, seventy times in one second
Hummingbird style, seventy times in one second
Stress rap, this applies to where we rest at
NY City full with nothing but stressed cats
That wanna test that flame of yours, but not ready
When we aim, the war's absolute retaliation against all, all for real
Stress rap, this applies to where we rest at
NY City full with nothing but stressed cats
That wanna test that flame of yours, but not ready
When we aim, the war's absolute retaliation against all, all for real

[Chorus]
(I'm the calm one, but my crew is sorta sick)
Yeah, big l is the first to represent.
Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost
[Chorus]
Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.
[Chorus]
It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left
[Chorus]
Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.
(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!
[Chorus]

Why does it take blue skies that turn to gray
Before I have something to tell you about
I'm gonna change the way that I pray
And turn it inside out
[Chorus]
So now when I say I need you
It's not the way it was before
Your glory became what my heart is beating for
I need you even more, yeah
Sometimes it seems, I'm serving you just for me
Sometimes I'm blinded by the things that I think I need
Time after time you opened my eyes
Then take them off of me
[Chorus]
All my own desires
They seem to fade away
In the power of the moment
When I say
(I need you)
When I say I need you
It's not the way it was before
Your glory became what my heart is beating for
[Chorus]
I need you even more
I need you even more
Why does it take blue skies that turn to gray.

Bomb ass pussy
Ma ooh, you got that bomb, know you got it
Ma ooh, you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma, I know you got that bomb bomb pussy
(What are you doing?)
Nothing, thanks for asking, I'm attending a conference at the Holiday Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my colleagues, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Work on our ppt and sip on some blends
One thing leading to another let the work begin.
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
Peeps call me up, said it's a hotel party
Just bring the liquor there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 2-7 need a natural graze road
I'm already blowed, hit third I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like wassup
I told 'em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said, "Ain't you that boy that be on B E T?"
Ya that's me, ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in here, I heard 'em whispering
Talking 'bout, "That's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' he glistening"
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit, aww shit
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
Ma showed up like, "What's the hold up?"
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, and silly
The girl said, "Can I be in yo video", I'm like, "Yeah, oh really?"
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about it, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin' like they from an island
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen

(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
Stop, drop, kaboom, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands giggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doctor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For sizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In
(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps, won't you bring four of your friends

Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, disturbing tha peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holidae In
Bring a gang of that Hen, some D S O P
Oh wee, and light that sticky icky
And we gone do the damn thing, now what I'm talking 'bout
We gon' disturb the peace right now
Yeah we ain't doing nothing but chillin'
We chillin' and nuttin'
Know what I'm talking 'bout, so push the button
You know what's happenin', fa sizzle
Yeah bitch, trying to run from this pimpin'
You can't out run the pimpin' bitch, I done told you

First of all let me alert you that there's been a change of plans.
Cause now I plan to put the streets in a major trance.
Told me I couldn't drive a real beast the way I had planed.
I'm the one who put in work don't disrespect my aching hands
Feed the streets and feed the fans you tryna tell me that's your stance?
Better not piss the majors off, you better go and make amends.
Ever go against the suits, koopa you wont stand a chance
As soon as you think your ice cold you'll get hit with a avalanche
Jump up and down like a monkey take banana make em dance
when you do they'll take it back if you ain't down with their demands
throw a million in the jeans tell you that these they favorite pants
you can put em on for grands and tell them keep your fake advance.
First of all I wanna extend a very humble middle finger
to those who don't take me serious like I'm Jerry Springer
I'm not a dreamer went from a skeemer to riding beamers
I open the bag chips better be in it like its Keebler
I'm not a diva I slept on the same floor as others
With no covers and split what I had with four brothers
You don't love us you handle us like ain't no rubbers
impregnated your pocket so my 4 4 wanna say ay ayy hello to ya
No 50 50, no Young Ro and no Rasaq then what do you get
no more color changing click and a bunch of fans that aint forget
some of yall were claiming I was the only one in the gang could spit
now that everybody split you want the dick you make me sick
I'm not here to baby sit I'm just here to make the chips
I'm just gonna make this quick first I'm gone low then make this click
I know a couple people I could point the finger at
but every time you point a finger there's three fingers pointing back
the average Joe you see will be someone who acting shady
and it aint no jodecy you wont forever be my lady
no I aint lazy but swear that I think I'm crazy
remember every moment from every person that ever tried to play me
before you die your life will flash before your eyes wow
well if that true your life will flash before your eyes now
everyone is quite foul I get revenge you like how
eye for and eye a bullet burn below your eye brow
I hear the drummer drumming he told me that death is coming
death is coming for you tonight just like a freaky women
Ain't no dumin' down my flow it's shining now as I write this
might I remind you that being smart made me quite rich
life's a beat full of addiction with a cold body
got complaints but I am respecting it so highly
how could I let a clue so I be his flow by me
from the jump told me that he would be a nobody
maybe I'm rehashing my thoughts just to get a response
they say that bad publicity is publicity that you want
who wanna jump ribbit with it I'm the one who distribute this crap
cause I live it so you gon get it just how I give it
and you suckas at the top we gon talk in a minute
I'm posted up on the block bout to get on my pivot
Was never in love with money I thought I was but it always lust
they cut the budget but its okay we shall adjust
no failure cause success is a must
when I clean up I wont ever forget to wipe down the dust
so dust your shoulders off and get your favorite recipe
get in the kitchen with me we gon have a special feast
everyone that don't know trying to tell me what's best for me
deep in the game you in the bleachers trying to referee
So when they ask for a clue and what's next with me
come out of control is number 2 and the sneak attack will be number 3
don't say I didn't warn you

So, just sit back and max and relax
Off tracks that I kick, come on and give it up
'Cause I get funky like diaper rash
And you know I'm mad spunky and I'm making cash
I've got sex rhymes like Victoria's got secrets
To all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of a.k.
Like a sound that to the depths of the soul
Well that's the feeling that I make my goal
A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my grape ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mix tape
Because I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train then Don Cornelius
Got the mad subwoofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
Wires hitting switches connecting at the junction
Perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in S.D. 50 'till early morning

Thats how I be likin my mic
You gotta know how to adjust that shit
I came to the fork in the road and went straight
Right out the crack vile to the golden gate
See the silver spoon in my mouth it had cake
My rap birth date debut song was ice bait
Readit like a novel, Donna Cappa Gones
Strivin my duns be dollars and coins
Whether in new york or compton californs
I come correct twenty two outfits and a mic check
One derby, cappachino the great
Sittin at the table where the gambinos ate

Head crack talk back, verbal attack
Side track you get japped with my lyric impact
Snap outta that, cappadonna seven sauna
Thirty three pirranha, chaos like iguana
Projects is rated x I flex and terminate
Sex mc's is wet so I'm the right source to vex
Endo mic buff, willie on the mic

What wu-tang clan is the sword new addition
Seek a recipe antidote poke g, ebony
Sunz of man and killer bee can't fold under pressure
Respect the abbott, wu orchestra, what
Fancy talk magic, wise up

All up in a staircase a scareface was lookin
Wallet got tooken

Brooklyn bound, with the sound
Hop the turnstiles

Yeah, yeah,
Follow me, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world so dark
And oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold oh!
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake
A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go God only knows
Stay wide awake
Fe fi fo fum
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park it and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore your the kinda girl that I'd
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wida
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I mite flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian girl now lets see ya have triplets and I'll
Disintegrate them babies as soon as that out her with formalda-
Hide and cyanide girl you can try and hide you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vrim! vrim! and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out, uh!
Soon as my flow starts

Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake
A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, god only knows
Stay wide awake
So dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide n' seek like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but Gee why does she taunt me
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep
Who's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me
He's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny
She's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty
Stay away from cuz I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart

A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, God only knows
Stay wide awake
Better try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage your power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Power there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars
Jabba the Hut be di bye bye, be di bye bye it's time to die die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien bath me in holy water
Melting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that
What was that dial nine-one-one someone's comin' in from the back
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake
A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, God only knows
Stay wide awake

We was throwing rent out, they be pulling lint out
RIP to Bundles and it's free my nigga [?] out
Pray I go to heaven 'fore I ever go to hell
Riding with the blinker fully loaded, ducking 12
Pocket full of bands, stupid with them grams
Take it out the pot and wrap that bitch up in Saran
Riding in the 'rari, party out at Diddy's

Fresh up out the bottom, talking 30k a walk
40 on the wrist, another 100 on the drop
Open up the trap and watch the smokers do the wop
When that money coming in the feds closing on the shop
Standing on the couches, bottle Ace and bottle Rose
Doze off in the trap and had a dream about a Rolls
Got some niggas locked cause they done played it by the code
Made a killing off the block but now we do that off the shows
Don't be tripping on the phone lines
Got a brick and turned my block into a gold mine
Nigga end up in a cell and I'ma hold mine
When they talking bout the money I be styling on them niggas like

[del]	aiyyo whattup el-p?

Tryin to listen to my walkman
This motherfucker all in my face
Tryin to holla at me and shit
I'm like, "man - dude you just a offspring"
[del]
I'm very interplanetary and vary with various experiments
Gregarious with verbals for your merriment
What el-p tell me to use, the beat di-ffuse
You lose and get played like a mood
I'm rude revolting leave you molting
No thing - compares to my compadres
We'll take it to broadway
It's beautiful the execution flawless
You all wet, soggy groggy when you saw me
But I never tire whenever I adjust my thrust
Females blush I bring the california gold rush
Your flow sucks, your stamina can't endure
I manicure your lavender amatuer landed words
You haven't heard? cannabis analyst
Add a twist to my manuscripts
I'l have you sent to the showers
Me and el-p, is superpowers like the us and ussr
Blow you like the deathstar
Leave your chest scarred like sagat
My plot proliferates, hits you like barbituates
In a twist of fate and splits your face
It's the great deltron-z, soundbombing
Run to mommy, I'm airin out your dirty laundry
I'm shooting then executing you're aiming from mainstream
Your brain tingles, strangles your lame jingles
Bingo I bring flows that attack like wild dingoes
Can't be pigeonholed, anything goes gringo
[el-producto]
Here we go - up jumps the outcast, sever the connection
My mostly overconfident acquaintances pull numbers
To the anti-potients and fear that I drip sick in
And rise out of my shell to teach sick or bedridden emcees
Til they fear living
Blockin the cocks that bust shots, spittin smitten bitches
Til the day of the locust, kitchen cutlery cuts
Dmx 16 crossfade with a strange lust
Dr. strangelove, born in the back of the train, fameless shame
Shared with acne pick brain pit
Tried to capture the moment of subtle death
Destro magnet spit - action fit into capsules
Slipped in the dirty waterway speaker cabinets
Maximum b-boy axiom stabbin shit
Intellectual women find that my rhyme style relaxes them
And wonder if I fuck to the same rhyme style pattern
It's autobahn pipe bomb glass fragment shatter
To break new jacks at after parties for actin actual
Factor x into your formula for fresh thoughts
With a megalon wingspan that bulge from the back of the text radical
Radio time tracks flatten your flattery
The tradition excuse used by biters; ambiguously homo
Knotted tights and colored underwear
That's wrapped around the brittle legs of
Things without weapons - I'm grief diseased brethren
Swim in a sea of shit and malt liquor, feed on excedrin
Radiate through tenements; emcees bleed estrogen!
Chorus: del and el-p
Watch insanity increase
Break it up piece by piece
Never weak in the least
Think you better see a priest
(mortality, don't battle me, it's costly
We the raw breed all of y'all is just the offspring)
[el]	yo del kick that shit again

Tomahawking your tom-tom club
You tried to holler at me at my show, lookin like you on drugs
You love the del I'll thug you, bumpin juvenile
Thinkin you in style, packin like you movin now
I move top speed, scott free with cock-d
Knock-kneed delivery that scorches you like lockheed
Dr. decibel, my deliverance is questionable
But as far as this session goes I'm wreckin skulls
Better check your pulse, we visionaries with this
Scarin the shit outta record labels next to fatal
Right beside homocide bonafied bewilderment
Militant diligence like I'm buildin pyramids
Peel your cap reveal your lack of flavor
Track your pager plus your celly
Piss on your pele pele, catch you comin out of belly
Dumbin out daily, tell me, what was your rationale
Think of matchin del I disconect your pactell
My mobile code words, showboat with no hope
For any rhyme you kick or any beat you load up
Leave you catatonic off a bag of chronic, skanless with anthems
Stomp your little cadence out at random

Ran-random, ran-random
El and del-aphonic known to go off on a tantrum

For the misplaced famous, for all the video gamers

For the ungry hungry ass verbal brain rapists
That new york to the bay shit!
"go off, go off!"

A young hog in the hood playin' chase
Smile on his face
Havin' fun 'cause it ain't nothin' like this place
And you don't want to race
Fool I got the new ones on
And we can run from the corner to the Newman's home
And after that we goin' go raid the plum tree
And stick ball down where those bos be
Mom's got the door open bumpin' Marvin Gaye
Let's get it on all day everyday
At night I pray
Lord just let me make it
And if I die before I wake then my soul you take it
Never fake it
My older brother taught me game
And sometimes even let the young soldier hang
As a lock
My only duty was to soak
And pass it on to my comrads and closest folks
All friends I knew about it as a child
I stood proud have you ever seen a ghetto smile?
I'm at the junior high actin' bad at the dance
The slow jam got me with a woody in my pants
And my baby with me
Her Momma used to babysit me
And back then she was just plain old pretty
But nowadays it seems that she done grown
Jeans fitting and her perm gotta hella long
Would I be wrong if I whisper and take her down
And maybe play housesitter with her like the Pound
It's goin' down about now in the Northern Bay
The OG's put it down and make they pay
Flip a 6-8 'stang with the blew out braids
The only homey in the hood ridin' on thangs
And as I peep it thangs have got a little deeper
And everybody and their Momma done bought a beeper
And then they post on the lake gettin' loose and wild
You know the scene it's the ghetto smile
At 18 I graduated and now I'm grown
About time for the dog to get his own bone
I left home got a condo out on Quailridge
And like a king is how this young playa live
Swimmin' parties in the pool with my dope to roll
Wasn't trippin' off nathin' we was all folks
Hillside in the house and we gettin' perved
Freestylin' gettin' on my neighbor's nerves
I love the hood so everyday I'm back to visit
And swoop the young so that they can come through and kick it
And peep the game just as I did as a kid
And watch the savage get his cabbage and place his bid
And even though we fight we still remain game tight
Handle business and always open for forgiveness
It ain't nothin' like a homey you ain't seen in awhile
So when you meet him greet him with that ghetto smile

21 years of my lifetime (4x)
21 years
Choclair's in the house (21 years in my lifetime)
Ill B
Uh (like that)
You need to recognize
21 years of pure bullshit
It makes me wanna bang my head on the walls
And do some shit like all straight swarms in the malls
Mentality, it's not where it should be
When you see red and white lights break the night skies
Reflection of a mad man in the tear
Not another brother dies, another in handcuffs
Mothers knees start to buckle up
And fall when they see their child outlined in chalk
Silence broken by shots or screams from knives cuttin through your flesh
Cold steal interrupting blood streams
The ponds are grim, but they froze if do it right or bring your luxury
Man for real, it makes me wanna run the drug deal
I'm sick of all this loose change, pennies, nickels, and dimes
My pocket wants the bills, every day flat meals
Fuck this lifetime, struggling needs, stretch a dollar like a pack of Ramseys
It's all that you can see, that you can be something when you had nothing
Frontin just to be down, but only gettin clowned by your peers
That swat fights happened at Nathan's Square every year
Understand I
Never seen my dad since grade 9
Maybe years before or after I don't know
But I know that time flies
So I just rely on my family
My mother and brothers, and my boys is the first before these others
And try to be strong through the hard times
And tough times, my heart dies every time my mom cries
CHORUS: (2x) ("21 years of my lifetime" repeats through chorus)
All my life I kept my eyes on the prize
But every time I reached for the prize it demised
I wonder what's going on, but I gots to move
I gotta keep my head and I gotta stay strong
I look up in the air to see blue skies but grey clouds
They all the same, it always rain
Leavin on my face tear stains
I try to cover the worry and sad
Sittin there reminiscing on my dad
And shit we never had
And g's for some lead
I repeat to my boys cause I love you all truly
But people nowadays be acting unruly
So I live for now without forgettin the past
Cause I never know what time's left in my life glass
I surpassed through Oz
Not coming home in bullet wounds or in some squad cars
But what shit is this the repetoir
We all went to war, 45 non-stressed
Screwdriver's in the car
Situation's deep, juvenile influenced by veterans up in the street
Biz, now these street kids
Addicted to the game, unmarked cars and plain clothes roaming the terrain
(In front ofclub blood stains)
A mark of an assassin
Livin up and no wage
But all the latest fashion
Custom made links and shit
This is my pysche
Now could this be, out of poverty
Is this where fate wanted me to be
My thoughts out of control
Leavin stress on my mind (oh)
The point of no return
All my Richmond niggas know the steelo
CHORUS (2x)
I walk into the future on a narrow path
But every step I take it gives me flashbacks upon the past
Like the part I got stabbed
Andguns to my brain, man this life is insane
Sometimes I wish I was addicted to Novacane
Cause leave the pain away, fade away, take my soul away
See another day
Dwellin upstairs with my grandma and grandpa
Cross my heart, racin like I would be testin stamina
And everywhere I look I'm seein white picket finces
But reality I'll only see my boys gettin sentenced
That's what I'm seein all around
So fuck the picket fences
All I see is elevators goin down
But discouraged, nah
I know where I wanna be
Just smilin, strong like the island
Cruisin on the ave in the black cad
And with the sound press on the prodigy
Minus DJs and the H-I-double L-T
O-to the P
Understand me
Parents leave a child stranded
So they grew up and to be bandits
I can't manifest Richmond Crew
All paranormal, to my peoples God bless
21 years of my lifetime

[Verse 1]
Yo I grew up in Mid-City near World on Wheels
After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family
[Chorus]
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels
[Verse 2]
Peace King, peace haki, peace queen
I only leave em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents (Rakaa)
Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to the end zone
[Chorus]
When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
Create to devastate crew, that's family
[Chorus]

Heart as, hard as, Chinese arithmetic
Avante garder, not a heretic
Figure out a right rhyme, stick it in my cranium
Pete Nice, elemental like uranium
Throwin' joints, blowin like a cool breeze
Swimmin' in, I lift on juice, I wax MC's
These hoes go frontin' on my Jimmy
I smack em on the back, sit 'em down, say
"Gimme some rhythm" (Rhythm!) baby loosen up my collar
I'll lay you out, like a funeral parlor
Ready willin', fillin', killin' for a billin', top
I never stop, with Serch and Sam drillin' it
Soul in the hole, MC's workin'
Kickin' it, vickin', the suckers who be jerkin
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that I'm squeezin' your girl (You never please her!)
So I pleased, then I threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so I muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope I say nope, I wear def clothes
Dapper like Dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or I'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum
(Diggy drum) Three the hard way, wordz of wizdom
"This time there was three"
"One two" "Three the hard way!"
"This time there was three"
"One two" "Three the hard way!"
A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin' you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make you your will Bill, three is gonna break out
The stylee, me and P-E-T-E
Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Aiyyo Sammo, hook up the beat
And I'll lay the plan OH man
You just got taken, I took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the Guinness Stout
Usin abusin, those of the past tense
Funning gunning, but I'm summing up the nonsense
Three, the hard way, cards laid are OK
Gettin' up and settin' up, just for a payday
The minister, sinister (I ain't no devil!)
Ten snakes circle and scoundrel Sam level
This track to SMACK, the smile off a doubter
The brother's, another MC who's about
Frontin' like he's buntin', deceivin' the delinquent
Rappers on track, bustin' out a medium
For those opposed, who manifest a diss
Pete tell em: "Manifest this!"
Not righteous, but might just, make you want to listen
Yo I'm Elvis with the wordz of wizdom
"This time there was three"
"One two" "Three the hard way!"
"This time there was three"
"One two" "Three the hard way!"
A ludicrous Buddhist, boo this when I do this
So true to this, perpetrators view this
Style, empirical, lyrical, it's critical
Three the hard way, boy you need medical attention
I'm like a surgeon in my left hand
Hold a microphone like a scalpel so you understand
Wordz of wisdom, woven like a spider
Bitch on my tip, I get busy and I ride her
Uptown, then I drown her like a psychopathic
Cause I'm graphic on the mic I never let go
Light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
Prove with the rhyme I'm down, Sam's hands
Transform strong (too strong) as a good pitch
Switch up the wizdom, into word which
Kicks out the Benzi in a frenzy it sends me
Up the Bronx River back to Brooklyn apprehends me
Like a d-tech bustin' my man in the projects
I'll send you up North, I ain't givin' respect
Prejudicial, your style artificial
As live as limb that's attached to a cripple
It's simple (so simple) eliminate you like Gotti
I chill in Bed-Stuy and drive a Mazzeratti
With the body of a freak on my side, how am I livin''?
(How ya livin'?) Larger than large, with the wordz of wizdom
Hyper-selective, Serch is attracting
Females who focus on the future, not slacking
Rhythmic it's too quick, feel it, I let it flow
Sam Sever seas'll submerge, so let it go
Throughout, or put out, lyrics like a d-valve
Speak up, a deeper meaning as I leak out
And seek out, a three the hard way endeavor
Pete Nice, Serch, produced by Sam Sever
Livin in my shoes boy, this is not Shoe Town
A showdown for Motown, it's a new sound
Lyrics that lick, the tick off a timepiece
Foamin' at the mouth punk, you need a leash
What are you sick?? I'm a slick stupid scientist
Rhymin' that you can't comprehend (but you're buyin' this)
Record I'm wreckin', my homeboys are breakin'
Hopin' that you're copin', no slopin', I'm not takin' no shorts
'Cause I'm playin' the high post
Ask any girl in the place, who's the fly most
Brother with a cover, shootin' to my cribbo
The tease wants a please, girl screamin' ditto
So I did this, I needed the bed rest
Hangin' with the bangin' on the strength, there's no contest
Physically or lyrically, it's my kingdom
Stingin' 'em and bringin' 'em the wordz of wizdom
"This time there was three"
"One two" "Three the hard way!"
"This time there was three"
"One two" "Three the hard way!"
Shammo hook up the def mix!

Dilated, dilated, dilated..
[Evidence]
Yo
I kill ciphers
That's how I went from good to God
I ain't perfect, yet n' still the hood is ours
And it's worthy, good people here work good and hard
But the news really only shows crooks and stops
It hold you for commercials and talk you into buyin shit
I was taught to learn from life and learn from my environment
Rocka walks the street as the son of a preacher
Who's the son of a preacher with people tryin to reach ya
I visualize the rise and realize the falling
High as time flies I recognize the calling
Went from lavish life to savage life back to lavish life
But never average, might be caught like Christ for the sacrifice
I still roll up my trees
For ? I meditate to roll up my sleeves
We adjusting readjust
I said I touch the world and the world said
Reach us
Reach us
Open up the world people ?
[Evidence]
You know these days ain't gettin any longer
Now, it's do or die
Now or never, time to hit the street
We on the move
Ride out with shit to prove
Everywhere we go they like:
It's a green light for you
Got lyrics about pleasure some about pain
From Southern Cali where they say it never rains
It's different dames that make me count blessings
We burn for our peeps that ain't here as we sing
Reach us
In God we trust no doubt that's a must
A hundred times see us but still catch the rush
And when we fly bless the sky
Let your mission unfold
You in the car we in the bus bless the road
How could I reach you if I wasn't real
Might have to go before you really studied the flow
And understand the deal
This year fuck before mad, loud and clear
You know that's the truth they can't
Reach us
Reach us
Say this cause I mean it from the heart
Reach us
[Evidence]
Yo
What happened to me, nah what happened to you
The crew ain't changed the numbers the sames
The lack and the fools, the check for Cali dimes down to Georgia peaches
At our shows to book us, ? is how you reach us
Got ho's girls I see got queens
Got friends got enemies and in-betweens
Teacher are students, students are teachers
Low key or prestigious I reach you, you reach us
I see lines around the block in the snow it's cold now
I see people gettin hot when the shot is sold out
I see dime pieces to the front to rap along
To every word, word for word to every song
I raise every head and every arm
In every jam from every stage we stand on
People climbin over barricades and still
I tell security chill, they only tryin to
Reach us

You are sleeping!"

[Pete Nice]
Black zone darkness, void as snakepit
So I'ma spit a lyric at the packed lip
Sit stunned I drum lyrics in your egg case
Space filled, darkness a blank face
Recognize unknown throne at deep depths
A Prime Minister incites a slow death
of a rational thought through the physical
Triple Stage Darkness, first stage lyrical
Sight to see, a piece of the Serch-light
Truth is loose, lips slips to Twilight Zones
Prone to blow revision
I'm 20/20 and your in-tune is in prison
Switchin from this track, move back in motion
Unaware of your own evolution
Regress through the tunnels and flee light
Illumination, the first stage, my birthright

[MC Serch]
Deaf, dumb and blind, the 3rd Bass find
you move further away from the swine
As I rhyme and effects your slide into tape decks
Light black in your face, what do you do next?
The question posed -- you're livin in delerium
Serch speakin in a spasm, can't you see him?
But you can't see the light's dim, it's growin darker
Cut off from the knowledge, un-smarter
Depart from the norm, completing a born to born
from opportunity, comes a thunderstorm
that sets in, tricked by the trickster
The only way out is DJ, Night, or Prime Minister
You follow, but attention span is minimal be
Now you're lost, never thought of intellectually
The 3rd's word, guide you as we spark this
Cause you're blind in the second stage of darkness

[Pete Nice]
As I move, I soothe like stimuli
Not professor of hype, ask why
some fable'll hold true to written word
Over lessons of life, the 3rd of Bass
Face up, step to a devil
Not takin, but remain invisible
Men judge by passin a mountain
called Caucus, and ignorants are mouthin
[MC Serch]
Fallacy, the great fall, fell in disgrace
How can hatred uplift a race?
Not a dribbler or watermelon picker
Givin you the Gas Face, as I'm dickin ya
DOWN DOWN DOWN, but up from Sa-tan
Knowledge is a child with a mind and a crayon
Brilliance in difference, tracin true sight
Third stage knowledge, brought forth a new light

VERSE 1
Little Tony said don't get a rock, get the 'volver
When you throw-back on a hater, make 'em holla
I love meetin' real men (yeah)
Not intimidated by a woman's plans
To get the riches and flip it, so we can it, y'all
We doin' things all night, you with it
Fuck a mule, give me the banker
'Cause she gone shack it up for them paper chasers
Boy you know I'm unbossed, unsold
So take it easy when you talk to me from the horse
Four shots in the sky, muthafucka' I'm a ride or die
You know my steelo is loco, but we can take it there
You say you famous, player, nigga, I don't care
You love this ass that you wanna' control, but
You know this chick is hard to hold, so
CHORUS
Why you wanna take my sunshine
My sunshine is all mine

Why you wanna take my sunshine
My sunshine, my sunshine
VERSE 2
I know you wanna keep me in a small box
But I'm crossing over worldwide, baby, what you got
From the bottom to the top I can make it hot
One woman, one label, I can make it pop
Don't front like you don't know the name, player
I'll give you five, but I want my change, hater
People say I'm insane, I can't make it through
But I'm a cross that bridge, show you what it do
So put the money where your mouth is, kid
My name is famous and I barely do gigs
I got the word-of-mouth on my shit
If people love it, nigga, fuck showbiz
I'm a trend-setter, hater, come and follow me
If you want the same old shit, follow industry
I'm sending love to the south for embracing me
And to my west coast fam
You know how we be
CHORUS
Why you wanna take my sunshine
My sunshine is all mine

I stay on the grind 24/7, nigga
I ain't here just to make my account bigger
But if I get the figures
You can figure that it be
While you muthafuckers hate, I get royalties
To the ladies that got their independency
If you feel me, baby, clap yo hands and stump your feet
Don't let no damn body tell you who you ought to be
Don't let no damn body feed you all that garbage, B
Listen, when them haters try to make you melt
Just keep the faith, baby, love yo-self
You got the power, you don't need they help
You got the power, baby, trust yo-self
Thank you haters for puttin' me to the test
Thank you haters for teaching me to love myself
Thank you hater for helping me to be the best
But for now, to the left--to the left

Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time
Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane

Look at my bitch, you can tell I ain't lie
[Verse 1: CyHi]
Cause shawty the truth, look like somebody just shot at the coupe
I call it my Kennedy whip, I'm missing apart of my roof
My people been flashy since Africa, so pardon my roots
Choking on kush, got this rope on my neck I won't call it a noose
But I'm keeping the peace, I won't call it a truce
Glock or revolver, it don't matter cause all of 'em shoot
Been ballin' since I was a youth, I look like a starter from Duke
Lord I just wanna make a Meek Mill and menage with my blue flute
This bitch ain't from Kalamazoo
Boy it's all in the suit, roses are red, violets are blue
My money, my pistol, my diamonds are too
So bring all of the goose, rosé and all of the brew
I be reneging the space cause I got a hard time following suit
[Hook: K Camp]
Lord Lord Lord, I cannot tell if they playing
This life too crazy, I swear it's insane
Look at my wrist, you can tell I ain't got time

[Verse 2: CyHi]
Lord Lord Lord, if they wanna go to war war war
I got two .22's, one about four .44's
My daddy told me, you can die by the sword sword sword
But I ain't got no choi-choi-choice
Cause some shits you can't affor-for-ford
So I'm ridin' round [?]
Why I'm serving niggas by choi-choi-choice
So before I got six feet, I wanna turn Peachtree into Freaknik
Toot my own horn, nigga, beep beep
Got a French hoe whole love to oui oui
And the pussy clean, she a neat freak
Fuck her so good she got a TT
I got a lead road runner, shawty meep meep
Kush came in the jar like it's pig feet
Back when I used to rock Enyce
I was tryna get her out of Baby Phat
Her boyfriend call her from Chile
Talking 'bout "Can I get my baby back?"

They want to hear good freestyling with sarcasm of Woody Allen
Their parents own oil rigs
They're just some spoiled kids who I must aim to please
And so I'm dipped in a syrup vat
And you know this town is a tourist trap
Run by entertainment industries and the bureaucrats
Selling the ultimate brain freeze
This year I'm Sambo
I'm on the Clear Channel
I'm smiling and reading my parchment of prose
I talk of the common man and of the promised land
But I'm insincere and make the Marxists doze
My head was a jar of lit bulbs
I used to make viewers carsick at shows
But now I'm easily the most compromising slut
Oh, it's hard to keep this harlot clothed
I network and do more than schmooze
I start licking toes
Underground rappers smell like garlic cloves
But me, I'm smug and decadent
Paid obscenely to appear at a set event
Companies license my likeliness
Money, it heightens my flighty fits
I wrote the great American pop song stylized to my respective tiny niche
I wasn't invited to your shindig
I've got no plus one and a low slush fund
I never expected to ever win big
I never expected for you to open my press kit
The attendance is always subpar when I perform at a club or bar
Why did I choose to do weird shit
I steered my career off a cliff in a flaming stunt car
So now I'm falling down a bottomless pit
But I'm trying to be optimistic
I spin microwaveable plates
But the label prorates nothing
My arms are to cotton pick with
Look at the poignant portraits in my doodle sketch
Meaning and art exude with every brush stroke
But my promises of revolution are futile threats
I'm so over sensitive my crotch is bloodsoaked
I'll African dance and cast a voodoo hex while in your dorm spilling all the bong water
And count the stars in the nebula until a goggleplex while selling you sticks of nag champa
I dumbfound in the coffee shop
Looking like Jean-Michel Basquiat
And kill gaudy pop with dirty laundry smell
Acting all foolhardy
Leaving kids oddly distraught
Gentle laughter when I'm telling jokes at your dead pool party
I am a necromancer of an exquisite corpse
I'll cry ten minutes in your wet tennis court because I wasn't invited

I looked out the window and seen his bald head
I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair
Launched that shot and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
Loaded up the slingshot and let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check correct with my egg gun
The egg a symbol of life
Go inside your house and bust out your wife
Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke
The trigger I pulled his face the yolk
Reached in his pocket took all his cash
Left my man standing with an egg mustache
Suckers they come a dime a dozen
And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about
Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall and then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman he said "bloodclot!"
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
I egged the chicken then I ate his leg
Riding the trains in between cars
When I pull out the station, you're gonna get yours
Drive by eggings plaguing L.A.
"Yo they just got my little cousin esse"
Sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny
It comes from a chicken not a bunny, dummy
People laugh it's no joke
My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yolk
Now they got me in a cell but I don't care
It was then that I got caught catching people out there
We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back
We began to attack the eggs did crack on Haze's back
Sam I am down with the program
Green eggs and ham Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker K-pap
You made the mistake you judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
You woke up in the morning with a peculiar feeling
You looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
Families punk rock the businessman
I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand
Not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead here's a towel now wipe

I walk into the club looking kind of sexy now.
I see these shorties in the corner, they started making out.
They pull their panties down, they take their pants off.
Then they started getting freaky on the dance floor.
Shake it mommy give it to me like you need some love.
I got some bottles in the caddy that we can open up.
Let's get drunk tonight, baby we don't have to fuck.
And bring your friend along, maybe we can have some fun.
Let's get freaky now, let's get fucking freaky now. [x4]
I got these bitches all tipsy trying to sex me.
I know they want it, alcoholics are some sex freaks.
This ex and chronic gots me wanting to get messy.
So let's get messy girls, come on let's go get messy girls.
Come on bitch, you know you want this.
That hardcore shit will make you feel the toxic.
Fursachi, Rolex watches.
Bently coups with the 20's droppin.
Convertible top, and the wheels spin.
I can taste that ice when my grill is in.
If you want me baby feel me in.
'cause I don't waste my time with lesbians.
Let's get freaky now, let's get fucking freaky now. [x4]
Liar! [x8]
Oh baby why did you have to lie to me.
I can't play no more games.
These thoughts are slowly controlling me.
You're turning off the flame.
So go baby go baby.
You don't want me.
So go baby go baby.
Come and get me.
So go baby go baby.
You don't want me.
So go baby go!
Come and get me.
Let's get freaky now, let's get fuckng freaky now. [x4]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I can't do that Timbaland shit, that that shoop shit..
There goes that damn Bubba just bein his country self
Slide inside Timmy's track and ride it 'til nothing's left
Bet you then they'll get the picture, a legendary mixture
like Jim Beam and Coke, can you cope with that elixir?
Drank it, that'll fix ya, why you angry anyway?
I'm in the same mud as you, been dirty for plenty days
Okay, let's get it on, in any shape form or fashion
At the Tunnel in New York, or at the dorms out in Athens
y'all still don't hear me? Am I not speakin clearly?
I just throw y'all little lames on any trash heap that's near me
Fuck 'em, hot damn 'em, really, to hell with 'em
Send 'em to Nelly B(?), and certainly they'll get 'em
I really don't have to answer to questions that y'all present me
But I know why after this here session, y'all resent me
Never the one to fuss, just smile and let 'em walk
Okey-dokey, now they knowin how Bubba talk
[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey, dis dat Bubba talk
y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey - SPIT BOY!
[Bubba Sparxxx]
This time it gets ugly, my folks done got to drankin
Some rednecks and thugs in the club, now what you thankin?
Hopped up and stankin, bankin on Bubba's rise
All up on that Betty you got, with rubber thighs
Can't help but love them guys, they happy they out the country
But the country's still in them, black and nappy, white and grungy
Lawd this boy's gone, from dirty to fast speed
And if she don't visit, we snatchin that rare squeeze
If you mad leave, this is not yo' type of party
Some Jim Beam with gin and Henn with white Bacardi
Yeah we quite retarded but hell you only live once
Still talkin Bubba but I can't complete the sentence
[Chorus]
[Bubba Sparxxx]
I slowly let my anger turn to just concern
for y'alls well bein, I'm seein there's much to earn
In this money pit of music, this dummy shit's amusin
That's what you think it is? Meet me at the bank with this
I'll withdraw the same two bills and spend it on port (?)
y'all can't run with me, stay on the porch please
There's somethin special, about Bubba's mannerisms
That's why they should accept, any helpin hand I give 'em
I don't know, is it me, or is this industry foul?
They used to be sugar but they shit to me now
Get in and get bent, that's enough then cut me off
No matter what it cost it's worth it when Bubba talk
[Chorus] - repeat 2X

(Say! Hit it! Goddamn! Hit it! Goddamn! Hit it! Goddamn! Say! Lord! Hit it! Goddamn! Damnitt! Hit it! Goddamn! Watch it! Hit it!)
When, when, when.
When we were, Kinda thing, Betcha cry, All alone(x4)
(Who am I?)
Reck league I ainit payin to ball
Ya'll be string like a broke guitar
An he still put it down like the family dog
Yeah!
I murder some
Murder one
Explain it all
Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah what you sayin to it
Old money look, no money don't do it
Like I turn around an they lain like a uie
An I'm only lookin back if I'm lookin at her booty
(At her booty)
What's the rational?
They wanna smoke niggas when they Black&Mild;
So we act it out
(Okay cool)
When we were, Kinda thing, Betcha cry, All alone(x4)
Blue dream, By the bouquet, Tell em' blue face, On a tuesday
Can I have some?
#NiggasBeLike
Put a plus 18 on a evite
An I said what I felt, no rewrite
Nah, nah they cant hold me
June July, drop somethin
I double dare you
I mark somethin
I scorch winners I burn

[Dr. Dre]
Check this out, we've come to the last and final record
This is Dr. Dre in full effect and we gonna kick it off a little some this like this
We got my mella yella boy on the drums, We got Stan "the Guitar Man"
Dropping the rhythm. We got LA Dre on the keyboard and I want the whole
Posse in this motherfucker to rock on this funky ass beat we're gonna drop
Alright, So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this motherfucker , run it
[Ice Cube]
Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My melody is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scatter, it'll make ya throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo' body twitch, your eye's explode
Out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on the grand finale
[Dr. Dre]
Yea, yea that was funky but we need the motherfucking villian to speak
So kick it
[MC Ren]
The grand finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
If you're weak it ain't my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that's biting just to taste me
I make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say that I scare you, I can tell 'cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say fuck the police, yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a (cell pimp)
For what, maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale
[Dr. Dre]
Yea, y'all know what time it is. Easy motherfucking E is in the house doing
Damage
[Eazy E]
The name is Eazy for me to come off like the inforcer'
Mass murder motherfuckers in a course of
An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck the car, I do a motherfucking walk-by
Eazy-E and the D.O. to the C. and
Run house and there won't be no disagreeing
'Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I'm arrested (For what) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
Why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
'Cause they're paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack
Eazy but not that Eazy to deal wit
Especially if you're popping bullshit
Put the E-A-Z-Y and to the E
Expression of thought on the motherfucking grand finale
[Dr. Dre]
Yea, that shit was funky, last but not least is the motherfucking D.O.C.
This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it
[The D.O.C.]
Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping up the man wit the (swig tan) movement
Proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would've been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It's rough, I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-'T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now wit NWA on the motherfucking grand finale
[Dre]
Shout outs

Dark dream world
All alone
Shadows movin'
Shadows have long gone by
Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul
Our souls
Time slippin' by
I call out your name
All alone
Shadows movin'
Shadows movin'
Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul
If you had only liked my face
Where are you baby?
Where are you baby?
Dark dream world
Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul
Distant bell ring
But steps echo
No one on these streets
Callin' out your name
Where are you baby?
It's a dream world
Dark dream world
Dark night of the soul

So now you wanna know,
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you've never shown,
So why you think I'm bading?
I almost swear I made it.
So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me,
Who's be coming at the ill?
Fuck them, I'm a disease.
I put my money where my mouth is,
They be lying through their teeth,
Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan.
So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me,
I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me,
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve
Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated.
Lies. You've been guessing out them hoes, which are bullshit,
'cause you've been kissing on your balls with your small dick.
Look, I got my willy up.
And the camera's on, but now you call me wrong on life, that's why Harry's on.
Door signs and a proof big, two times my hun'
I ain't shutting off my time, I'm just letting my shit hang on light
Off the size of red cage I saw nine in like drizzy
This time I'd be on the game like Chris Brizzi did to Ree-Ree.
That's just D A to P P Y, I'm doing me G
Them ring tone rappers ain't got no credit, if one rings around, that brings one later.
Peace cake, soft and sweet, I'll piss on them, they all tie their seats
I shit on them, mighty freaks, they'll never catch me on the sun bath.
'cause no one cares about what the fuck was made in Chelsea,
The only way is the streets, don't care what no one tells me,
Skied off, once in, two shots, none left. Ten men, one pet. Ten times there?
Pussy roll on my carpet, 'cause the king of the jungle just tore that piece out the market,
They talking shit on the record, then why exhaust?
Doing us the dirty thing, is time to flush, 'cause the fucking thing's on it.
You solve it, you finish all, you dickheads be quiet,
I'm starving my face and I'm taking pussy, you on a diet.
You the type to go to Gucci? They caught up high just to try it,
They got picture, post it on Twitter and don't even buy
You don't hustle, you just listen to nipsy,
The only strap you only see is on the top of your kick
I go jump once before and you can even nor stinchy,
I got them on my shit back, and it wasn't my fish,
You see my chains link to my pride if you take what comes to my life
We get our sign, not even my toilet will let shit slide
Now let that book in mine and bring that pair around with that dick
If you only see the shape of that clip, suck it, I'm your prick.
So now you wanna know,
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you've never shown,
So why you think I'm bading?
I almost swear I made it.
So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me,
Who's be coming at the ill?
Fuck them, I'm a disease.
I put my money where my mouth is,
They be lying through their teeth,
Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan.
So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me,
I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me,
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve
Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated.

[Intro - Classified - talking]
Uh
Yeah
Nowadays, everybody's always askin me
"Yo Class, what can I do to make it in this music game, man?"
[Chorus - Classified]
(Step 1), get your flow, come out of your shell
(Step 2), learn the game and study it well
(Step 3), go for self, not anyone else
(Step 4), if you wanna be heard (you gotta yell!)
If you wanna make it in the music business
I wrote a couple steps that you all could follow
Gather all around, sit down and listen
And when it's time to go in, kid go all out
[Verse 1 - Classified]
Uh, yeah, a lot of people be hittin me up
Tryin to get into the game and mixin it up
Like, I got a name and I'm livin it up
Don't think I'm livin it up but I guess I'm gettin my cut
(Step 1), always stay faithful
And try to bring somethin new to the table
The game's tough and the world can be hateful
Prepare yourself 'cause that hate might break you
Look, a label won't make you
Just startin off? Don't worry about sendin in your demo
Shit nowadays ain't nobody mail demos anyway
Gotta learn, value every penny saved
(Step 2), make your music timeless
'Cause that'll live on after you gone in silence
Never run out of gas like drivin a Hybrid
You in for the long haul, so mind your mileage
Now to make a record takes real talent
But after that's when you face a real challenge
That's when you see who's got the heart and the valence
And honestly, it's hard to find the right balance
You follow me? Good, now the record is done
And the pressure is on and the lessons to come
Now we separate one from the rest of the bunch
The test has begun (the test has begun)
[Chorus - Classified]
(Step 1), get your flow, come out of your shell
(Step 2), learn the game and study it well
(Step 3), go for self, not anyone else
(Step 4), and if you wanna be heard (you gotta yell!)
If you wanna make it in the music business (yeah)
I wrote a couple steps that you all could follow (ha)
Gather all around, sit down and listen (uh)
And when it's time to go in (yeah), kid go all out
[Verse 2 - Classified]
Alright team, let's huddle in it
We gotta build our own buzz, the hustle begins
I know you write rhymes but can you draw crowds?
That's the key to success, so don't get locked out
You gotta draw hype, everything is fair play
Hit the blog sites, the streets and the airplay
Avoid the negativity, any haters and low lifes
And oh right, get your live show tight
(Step 3), always step up your performance
Nothin more important than doin shows and tourin
Hit the open mics, hit your local promoters
Who are puttin on shows and need a couple local openers
Be the engineer and the manager
And the record label and the janitor
Be a pro in this whole pro-cess
The promoter, the producer and you may progress
(Step 4), and when the real work's done
You know what they say "if you build it, they will come"
The labels come callin but the tables have spun
Now you got the under hand, you can take what you want
You think sellin records, is gonna make you income?
What I make in sales, I make in three shows and then some
Remember this, anyone can sell your music
But they can't sell your live show unless you're gonna do it
You can take this for whatever it's worth, my word
But there's no guarantees it's gonna work for sure
[Chorus - Classified]
(Step 1), don't believe all the shit they say
(Step 2), the industry is a shady place
(Step 3), and everybody is out for self
(Step 4), so if you wanna be heard (you gotta yell!)
If you wanna make it in the music business (yeah)
I wrote a couple steps that you all could follow (ha)
Gather all around, sit down and listen (uh)
And when it's time to go in, kid go all out
[Outro - Sample]
It's a game, at times unrealistic
But a game all the same
Somebody wins and somebody loses
It all depends on whoever chooses
To take it most seriously [fades out]

Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
Step back as I'm kicking up dust
For a while
As I put motherfuckers to rest
And pull their files
Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigga
Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold
Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow
You can't shake
That nigga that's gonna brake
Fool
On any one member of your bitch crew
As I pull the trigger
On my nine
Say goodnight nigga
Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye

Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye
You ain't never caught a rabbit
So you ain't no friend of mine
It's a habit
Barkin' up your tree with my nine
Keep your bitch on a leash or at home
A nick knack
Paddywack
Give the dog a bone
The raw dog
Fuck a law dog
Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
'Cause a every now and then I got to knuckle up
Buckle up
Chin checking
It's on I reckon
It's the wild wild west
Get your 40 and your blunt and your Glock and your bulletproof vest
Let me guess
Everybody want to test
Everybody burning up, gonna get burned like Ses
Laudy daudy
We're fucking everybody
Boom biddy bye
Sing the lullaby
In the party
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye
Yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Watch a punk slipin' see the puto fall
I'm buck-loody
Looking for the nigga who want to cut me
'Cause the nigga gets so funky
Fool I'm the one
From
The big bad Cypress Hill clica
Number one son of the funk freaka
Yes yes y'all
I'll be the one with the mad Buddha blast y'all
Comin' from the west y'all
But I figure
You'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch
'Cause I just might pull the trigga
Now lay down
Stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't fuck don't say nothin'
You fuck around and I might get ragamuffin
Boom biddy bye bye
Line up on the floor now you' all gonna die
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put the Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put the Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
It's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Time to say good-bye

Everytime I come around niggaz look at me up and down

Do I gotta open his head up somethin surgical
Take em vertical, never tatum while the verse is full
Oh no! We gotta bleeda, bitch meet the reaper
The devil ain't got no love for you, me neither
You don't want a nigga like me to see ya, keep a heata
The way my demons want you dead wouldn't wanna be ya
Joke's up, the G loc's up, so what shut up
We gon' see how tough you be when we roll up
Talkin more shit that a critic would til we visit his hood
Break his limbs chop him down, split his wood
Time out, get him out the game anyway
Fuck what anybody say, I can live with the fame
I came to master the game and dish out pain
You can't weather the storm get out the rain
All my killaz chant, die die
Dat all my killaz in the van, bout the murda ride
And strive, when we collide ya better be somewhere inside
Keep screamin fo yo life can't look a demon in the eye
[Esham]
You, you, you too light in the ass to try to step in the ring with a heavy weight
I'm bout to kill you, I give you a shot at the title but you must be suicidal
Who's ya idol punk? Who's ya idol? You wanna piece a this?
You can't handle this scandulous shit
Brain surgery you better murder me I need some therapy
For those who never hearda me you need a lombotamy
Gotta be in ya head like purgery, purgatory
Concocted the evil rhyme inside the laboratory

You got a minute for your son, Father?
I need to talk I'm so tired of trying to run, Father
Let's take a walk I'm so sorry for what I've done, Father
It ain't my fault The devil's been on my back lately He's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle But it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God
A lot of things that I used to I don't want to
Runnin' the streets like I used ta
I know I'm gonna speak the word for you one day
Up in the light -- Hallelujah!! -- on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife
You have carried me enough times and that's the truth
Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin' to get me
[Chorus:]
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
I'm lookin' at life a lil' different now since you hugged me
And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya
Jacob, ascendants, from Africa to Asia
Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad,
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya,
Thank you Father
[Chorus]
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like

[big l]
Yeah, it's the big l
Comin at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from uptown.. and everywhere
Check it!
Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
Cause mad clowns be catchin wreck with a tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up witchu in the long run
Brothers be all up on us, actin stupid, gettin lifted
They life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent; but they'd rather sell cracks
And bust gats and run the streets actin violent
To them it's all about hittin skinz and makin some easy green
Cause that's all they show you on the tv screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin a sweet nut
They don't give a (what? ) cause they street struck
Chorus: big l
You betta listen when l rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
Get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when l rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
Get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
[big l]
Before the rap contract, I was sellin crack
Stay strapped with a mac, I was into alla that
I started rappin and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this I might be doin life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game sellin 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that, if you're dead, or behind bars?
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Aiyyo they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave em up cause they street struck
Chorus: repeat 2x
[big l]
I still chill with my peeps in the streets; but most of the time
I'm in the crib, writin rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin me, like the crack be callin pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
Cause where I'm from -- you can choke from the gunsmoke
Stay off the corners; that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin on a hospital bed, from bein street struck
Chorus: repeat 2x
[big l]
Worrrd up!
Aiyyo take it from me, the big l
Cause I been through it all, youknowhati'msayin?
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the cats teasin streets
I'm outta here

As a kid, I was known, son of a thug
Snub-nosed .38 in the glove, who can relate with us
Never had an easy life, shits way out
Clips spray out, fools pay out or play out
Any scenario, been there, done that
Gone where some of y'all niggas, couldn't come back
Been through the hottest parts of hell
Came back with a hard shell and hard as nails
I went through it all, do it all, screw it all
Small you recall, the hard times as a juvenile
Often misunderstood
Some joined the military, others just joined the hood
Street corner combat, part of the dark streets
Your heart beats pump when my slugs release
And there ain't no tellin', don't be the one yellin'
These birds are deadly, they can shatter your melon
[Chorus: x2]
When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do
Grab your gat and squeeze one off
This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off
You got one shot to get you a knot
At the crossroads, sick of holdin' the badlands
Where street wars, kick off quicker than Van Damme
Mistakes of mad man, I remember the old ways
The old days where fools clapped yo'
No quarter, you feel me
Life expectancy's just a little bit shorter
G's gave the order, you carried 'em out
Quick fast, you the last nigga I'm worried about
Get that street lead, that was one step over the edge
Much closer to death, every step I kept on
Learnin' about the dark paths, made a hard left
Prayed to God death is swift and painless
This life ain't for everyone, stay out my shoes
You can't trade your fate, I hate to break the news
The young won't respect the fences these days
You a marked man if you get caught up in these ways
[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 1 - Currensy]
Showing no signs of letting up
Still kick you in the head like I think
You on the verge of getting up
No mercy, Cobra Kai, Cobra commando
Deadly venom spitting, n-ggas just a salamander
I'm living the life worthy capturing on camera, documented
How one of the last lives was deaded
How I rolled up in the drop, how I rolled up that sticky
How I rolled with them women, elegant player, no sippin'
How I f*ck them to sleep?
How I woke up out the building when I was finished
Keep it G, them n-ggas not original they muthaf-cking house of mirrors
Not quite the image, I'm on that Popeye spinach
Mama mai-tai sippin, she loves a square n-gga
But now she trying something different
Windy City Bulls, mention the Nets, wool jackets and sweats, Scottie Pippens
My description, high of that fuzzy green prescription
Lying if I said that I isn't
If you looking for that n-gga: I is him
All eyes in this direction, a burden and a blessing
[Freddie Gibbs]
Reporting live from the devil's pad
Breakfast here: two titties, two plus and a turkey bacon sandwich
2 seeds with eggs and bread jelly
My hoes they rarely pop that p-ssy,
They put off in my Pontiac on Pirellis '82 edition
Spotters body squatting on sixes?
Rather be counting stacks than stuck in the county, washing the dishes
Or washing drawers in the pen ?
I had to go pay the correct correctional officer to walk him in
Bail money on debt, come at my neck
Plus that boy cause that same place where him ? where he slept
I issue eternal rest, sign up and be a subscriber
The price of life thats so high that I must make sure I stay higher
Stay with the purp out of piso?
Smacking as deep as needles
They run in the rock just like I play quarterback for the eagles
Rando donovan in the mic a
'Fore I picked up this mic I was hitting licks
Did dirt with plenty disciples
I'm gang bang affiliated, federal investigated, self educated
All my co-conspirators catching cases
I got straight out of college and I made it at home ?
But believe I got the balls to clear up all of my altercations
Leave faces with operations, closed casket console
Tryna make million dollars, f-ck a million downloads
But if that equal the same, smash it up and give me my change
I made a lane up in this game so n-ggas goin' remember the name
Gangsta Gibbs ho, two bitches cooking in the crib hoe
Still push a bucket but I ride it like a Benz hoe
Tryna find a bridge ho, to slanging raps, from slanging weight
Said the Fred the new age ? call me baby face

And I'm willing to borrow your grass, but I specialize in eating MCs
In the immortal words of LL Cool J as he would say
I'm a G.O.A.T.
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is, it means the "Greatest Of All-Time", and I consider myself one of those, so thank you very much here it goes.
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do and how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know that I got a lot up in my abdullah oblongotta that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off, they're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky (haha)
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of a aura of that of a king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers and bangers, and the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbours
But see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MCs
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-Z, please be that just subliminally
He means he thinks that Jigga's the best, and that he's the only one up in that league, see?
And it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' Goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived period
I'm a G.O.A.T.
And I don't mean to gloat, but I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is, it means the "Greatest Of All-Time", and I consider myself one of those, so thank you very much here it goes
Maybe they figured that I'm on my way out the game so they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady
If they think it's gonna happen, man I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're try'na pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bring up that Paul Wall's white
'Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see he's just a'ight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that Snow White
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio, he's so gone off that coke, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause he's dope, right? America's next great white hope, right?
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass white rapper show, right?
'N which I'm still having mixed feelings about
They said to be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's something about a white boy talking black 'n runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when they say that Tiger Woods shit, "isn't it ironic that
The best rapper's white, and the best golfer's black?"
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had come out
But I had already hit middle America, parents just all got to likin' me now
And suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide
So I had to turn back into the bad guy
So "faggoty, faggoty, faggoty, gays, anatomy, God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy"
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucker because once I fuck her, she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? No.
You better save some of those kids for Madonna, she needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady, well you got it man. I ain't apologizin' for shit.
I'm a G.O.A.T.
And I don't mean to gloat, but I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is, it means the "Greatest Of All-Time", and I consider myself one of those, so thank you very much here it goes
Man, I'm takin' my ball and going home, man
This shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball, 'cause (I'm a G.O.A.T.)
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best, but y'all know that (I'm a G.O.A.T.)
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
Before I go I'd like to say fuck you very much to everyone who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everbody who was
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
And you don't gotta say it, just think it
'Cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that (I'm a G.O.A.T.)
Hahahaha
I'm out y'all, it's been real
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
Peace

You know, this just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' gotta bus' a K
I'ma take a phone call, hustle everyday
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from Lil Mexico & Let me Work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean
Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah,
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho, callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch "leave me the fuck alone!"
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolly
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind,
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate!
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Nas talking]
I heard that nigga Capone's home yo...
Word to Motha..that nigga Nore'
Doin' his mothafuckin' thing...thugged out
Entertainment...know what I'm sayin'? Niggas still in the streets...
Ill Will, Braveheart nigga, there's a thin line between streets and business..
So we gotta have balance and be easy...
I heard you fags want to catch me off guard
Put Tecks to my heart, the death of Escobar
Under your breath, whispers in the dark
I hear it 'cause the street ain't loyal to choose sides
Prepare for the beef, whoever lose dies
Rich and I'm thuggin'
I can't trust nothin', this bitch that I'm fuckin'
This clip that I'm bustin' could jam in my fist
Look at my hand, finger pussy with expensive rings
Cut coke cookies, wrote poetry and broke noses B.
The voice from Heaven
I'm God sent, of course a legend
This is part 1, speak my sermon, the hood reverend
Blunted eyes red
C-Class, a Hundred times Five Red
CD's blast, speed fast, haters drop dead
I'm gorgeous
black Goddess flip the arm rest, flip the cordless
Her body stacks the best, ass is flawless
Finally the long awaited shit, ghetto people the sequel
Nas, CNN, nobody's equal.
[Chorus]
Yo, Be easy
Keep the club off the heezy
Straight thugs in the back, drink creezy
Be easy, but we still smoke treezy
See us rippin' the shows with thugged easy.
Niggas picked me the boss
Ricky Ross
Lex Two-Fifty Horse power, click and devour the source
If it's flour then swallow your loss
I cock Fours, kick in Poppi's doors
All for the cash and the cause
Niggas break big fractions of laws
So what, we got it sewn up, smack every cat on the board
I speak the truth, guns spit at you, shakin' my palm
It's pitiful, wavin' my wand
The Don, a hundred follow me like Farrakhan
Chasin' my Henny, embrace Benny's
It's quite Frank, my niggas will kill, never waste a Penny
Money stay well invested
Feel the weight on my necklace
When death is too close flip the next shit
Thug the game out
Bust biscuits, pull the Range out
Public enemy, Queens Bridge where I hang out
Sweet scent of weed I wear like a fragrance
My energy's kinetic, mind power type ancient.
[Chorus]
I see death through the corner, die, kingdom come
Six 500's, pull up right in front of the slum
Sticky green fingers soldiers of the great God
Clarence spoke to the poor but he lived in Oz
An ill hook like Roy Jones, I'm a street corner bastard
And crush weed with the hashish
Bandanna head dome wrapped
Caddy trucks with the grills and the chrome snaps
I'm on point like Al Sharpton, come peep the M.U. marksman
The S-Class is shittin' on your weak Datsun
Graffiti written on the Bible, my life is wicked
I see dead corpses, and Rolls Royces
Put your heart on your lap, listen you hear voices
My whole persona is the drama and to smoke skama
I can lift it up, Willy what in front of your slut
Money bustin' out my pocket, your bank is stopped
[Chorus]

Chorus:
As I lay down and close my eyes
Wake up at sunrise
And all through the day, well I be moving on the grind
I know I aint made it so I be feelin inside
I gotta go harder to reach the top of this climb
But I
Got this feelin inside I know that imma - make it
Got this feelin inside ain't nowhere imma - take it

Got this feeling inside
Just this feeling inside
Little nigga, unstoppable so astronomical, phenomenal
So imma take over this game I promise you
Feel destined to do this, a superstar like Wasalu
Prodigy and passing you, conquering every avenue
Of what I do, I had the time, you back a few
Killin the game it's factual
Such a blessing to be here on this pedestal
I'm put on
Pressure but I still put on
For the supporters that got me here I can never do wrong
I'm too gone
Just in this place of it feeling close but looking so far
I never know when it's coming so I'm still going hard
Grinding it out everyday coz we ain't know what's here tomorrow
Never staying monotone and nigga be raising the bar
Feeling like a little Simba, stand round a bunch of Scars
Destined to be great but they all lookin below par
In it to win it they got this aint playing games, Tetris
Tryna still it from 'em like that is don't say I never say
Chorus: (x2)
As I lay down and close my eyes

Got this feeling inside

Just know I've been thinkin' bout you lately
To all my doubters, yeah I'm at the bottom
So what? It doesn't matter I got peoples on the ladder uh
That's right, younguns gonna blow
Top 5 MTV breakthrough artist, look at the votes
And numbers don't lie
Quit frontin' on my fly
They hit me on my blog just to see the things I like, uh
You know what immabout
Send you songs to Barry Bonds and imma knock it out
And you know I am everybody's hope
Say I got it notes all that got me here before, uh
Yeah, they wanna dress just like this
Uh, they wanna sketch my likeness
Uh, and you can't see me
It's the D to the I the G the G gees
Chorus: (x2)
As I lay down and close my eyes
Wake up at sunrise
And all through the day, well I be moving on the grind
I know I aint made it so I be feelin inside

But I
Got this feelin inside I know that imma - make it
Got this feelin inside I know where imma - take it
Got this feelin inside ain't nobody gon' - shake it
Got this feeling inside

When I made up my mind, that I was gon' blow
Everybody told me that I couldn't though
Then I put it on the line
And now it's a go
And everybody's saying uh-oh, I'm onnn

Just stop or you go
Imma give it all I got
And ride to the top
And nothings gonna stop me nooo
Chorus:

Huh say man
You know who get ready bro
It seems like they don't want a young nigga to get rich
Make money like we ain't supposed to leave the ghetto
But uh
I ain't trippin' life's a bitch
You know we was dealt some bad cards but
You know
We gotta deal with it
Life's hard so lets show em show em show em what's up
My gate way tuh hell seems like its constantly open
The reaper is callin' so I'm constantly smokin'
See-Murder ain't gonna die in vein
My ghetto ties got me livin' my life in pain
See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock
Cause I know its gone bust
I used to think the hood was cool
But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw
Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard
Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard
Lord control me
You know me
These cards I got to play em
My life is like a game
I'm up from a.m. to a.m.
My donner AK hem him
If he don't have none of my paper man
If I let him live
He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life
If you ever jack its real nigga
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that
How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now
But see how us niggas get caught up
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's
2 23s 90 degrees
I left them windows down to feel the breeze
My cousin be	and me and john in the back seat drinkin' off brome
And to the z
Thinkin' bout the lives we gonna free
Now tell a nigga please
Soon as we drove up fuckin' doe was about to close up
Knocked on the doe
Nigga hold up you didn't see us rool up
I forced my way in I put my seven to his stars
No time for thankin'
Is what I'm thankin' kill a bitch what you fittin' tuh say
I went to the kitchen I'm flippin' pans and pots and spoons
I heard foe glocks
Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room
Its bout that time for us hounds to get
Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone
Its over
I come to lay ya eyes buggin' out his head
Nigga bleedin' from the mouth
He's shakin' he's on his way out
But its time I took two from behind looked
John at the eyes and said nigga you ready tuh die damn nigga why

[Chorus]
I'm the jack of all trades, master of one
Black and underpaid, blastin this mic gun
Put it to your temple, and pop yo' pimple
Break you down like kempo, I'm trained in the arts
[Aceyalone]
I specify in rockin my page from the heart
I dig down deep within my psyche
Information excites me, the knowledge invites me
When I, throw on my Nike's and step to it nicely
Huh, it's unlikely any man could out-mic me
Lightning, please strike me like it did when I was a child
Hit me with a hundred thousand volts and make me smile
You name it I can aim it, catch it and tame it, explain it
Take it and paint it in beautiful technicolor
Directly from another place you could expect no other
To stand by these trues and break these rules
We defy the laws of cool and sang these blues and bring this news
[Chorus]
[Aceyalone]
I'm that hip-hop SPOKESman, I ain't a coke man
A good folks man, he reached for the mic and broke his hand
It's not my problem, it's not my fault
It's not my concern, I don't give a shit about
Them dirty fingers, reachin for the scepter
All up in yo' head but I'm not Dr. Lector
Or Dr. Phil, but I still got to kill
white widdle, black widdle, fat little pill
To take for your enjoyment, to get psychadelic
I don't sell it I spill it out, and tell it so angelic
My rap gat makes your brain splat
Blow up, everything that's holdin up your hat
It's firin the pistons gas, in the engines
Fuck a foot in the door, we takin off the hinges
When my, dash is broken, glass is broken
And class is open, and it's still left smokin
[Chorus]
[Aceyalone]
Okay Mr. Pick to Ten, is it sickenin?
What kind of little box you thinkin in? Think again
Draw a blank, you saw a tank
But didn't see my soldiers on the flank movin up another rank
The Hip-Hop Hall of Fame went up in flames
When they, mention my name it's tension in they brains
An extension of the game and, I stake this claim
And break these chains and this one's for the last train
I'm the jack of all trades, master of one
And the thing I mastered is blastin this mic gun
Put it to your temple, and pop yo' pimple
Break you down like kempo, I'm trained in the arts
We got one verse left to rock this beat
And separate the good shit from the weak
So, get in the groove, and feel the sound
And once you're inside spread yourself around
From the bottom to the top, top, to the bottom
I'm, gonna rock 'em, while, I still got 'em
I rock this hour with style and power
And this, is yo' MC hour
I don't know if, all of you have heard
But it's up to YOU to rip.. {*vocals fade out*}

[Talking:]
This goes out to someone that was
Once the most important person in my life
I didnt realize it at the time
I cant forgive myself for the way I treated you so
I dont really expect you to either
Its just... I dont even know
Just listen
Youre the one that I want, the one that I need
The one that I gotta have just to succeed
When I first saw you, I knew it was real
Im sorry about the pain I made you feel
That wasnt me; let me show you the way
I looked for the sun, but its raining today
I remember when I first looked into your eyes
It was like God was there, heaven in the skies
I wore a disguise 'cause I didnt want to get hurt
But I didnt know I made everything worse
You told me we were crazy in love
But you didnt care when push came to shove
If you loved me as much as you said you did
Then you wouldnt have hurt me like I aint shit
Now you pushed me away like you never even knew me
I loved you with my heart, really and truly
I guess you forgot about the times that we shared
When I would run my fingers through your hair
Late nights, just holding you in my arms
I dont know how I could do you so wrong
I really wanna show you I really need to hold you
I really wanna know you like no one else could know you
Youre number one, always in my heart
And now I cant believe that our love is torn apart
[Chorus:]
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you cause
I wanna hold you,
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And I really miss you [2x]
I knew you gonna sit and play this with your new man
And then sit and laugh as youre holding his hand
The thought of that just shatters my heart
It breaks in my soul and it tears me apart
At times we was off I was scared to show you
Now I wanna hold you until I cant hold you
Without you, everything seems strange
Your name is forever planted in my brain
Damn it, Im insane,
Take away the pain
Take away the hurt
Baby, we can make it work
What about when you
Looked into my eyes
Told me you loved me
As you would hugged me
I guess everything you said was a lie
I think about it, it brings tears to my eyes
Now Im not even a thought in your mind
I can see clearly, my love is not blind
[Chorus:]
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you cause
I wanna hold you,
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And I really miss you [2x]
[Talking:]
I just wish everything could have turned out differently
I had a special feeling about you
I thought maybe you did too
You would understand, but
No matter what, youll always be in my heart
Youll always be my baby
Our first day, it seemed so magical
I remember all the time that I had with you
Remember when you first came to my house?
You looked like an angel wearing that blouse
We hit it off, I knew it was real
But now I cant take all the pain that I feel
Reach in your heart, I know Im still there
I dont wanna hear that you no longer care
Remember the times? Remember when we kissed?
I didnt think you would ever do me like this
I didnt think youd wanna see me depressed
I thought youd be there for me, this I confess
You said you were my best friend, was that a lie?
Now Im nothing to you, youre with another guy
I tried, I tried, I tried, and Im trying
Now on the inside it feels like Im dying
[Chorus:]
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you cause
I wanna hold you,
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And I really miss you [2x]
[Talking:]
And I do miss you
I just thought we were meant to be
I guess now, well never know
The only thing I want is for you to be happy
Whether it be with me, or without me
I just want you to be happy

No more of these words (baby I'm sorry won't you just came back to me, baby)
I can't deal with your lies (I didn't cheat baby, she just kissed me)
I look right down when I continue to let you back in
So don't get pissed off when you see me with another man
[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I found all of these things (love letters, receipts of jewelry I've never seen)
So now I am taking (I'm taking my love, my respect, and my dignity)
Remember the night that I've spent all alone (you remember that? 'Cause I do)
When You were out with your new chick I was home see I,
[Chorus]
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
Now I'm through with you,
Done with you,
So damn fed up with you, over you, I can't believe that I fell
For you there's no words you can say to get me to stay
It's over and done I'm leavin' you
[Chorus]
'Cause I won't be no fool for you no more
Won't be no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more
I ain't no fool for you no more

I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing

Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please

I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets

In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies

Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me

This is for all you who are connected with
The two-way. Ya heard?
It's a two-way street, it a two-way door
It's a two-way life (Pick it up and two way me)
It's a two-way sky it's a two-way tel
It's a two-way life, pick it up girl and hit me
Girl it's so easy, it ain't as hard as you trying
To make it seem
All you gotta do is pick it up, compose a
Message straight to me
I won't hear your voice but all you thoughts,
That's what I sure will see
Go to and push them key, and tell me
All of them freaky things
(Now you got some choices to make, you got them colorful girl one,
You got them black ones, platinum ones:well me?)
I prefer that platinum thing, to go with all my platinum chains
Plus it's hot to death I figure, plus I'm just
That platinum nigga
If it's dark light it up, put 'em up. Put 'em up
If it's closed, flip it up, in the club, beam me up
I got mine on vibe, so if you get me, I'll feel you
I'll call you back real quick, no lie better yet,
I'll just reply
[Chorus]
I'll be within reach baby, I'll be right at your
Beck and call
Even if I'm with the fellas, or kickin' it down at
The mall
Just type what you want to say, go down to the
send and hit it
All your wants will be fulfilled, 'cause I'll get it
In just a minute
( Yo , I want y'all to know though, it ain't no lock on this joint
So, if you not careful, you might get himmed up knawmean)
I recommend if you play the game, don't think
She won't do the same
If you a player know when to fold, the game is to be told, not to be sold
If it's dark light it up, put 'em up. Put 'em up
If it's closed, flip it up, in the club, beam me up
Now I got mine on loud, if you get at me I'll hear you
I reply back quick it's true, betta yet I'll just come to you

Makin' stops down in houston, atlanta, vegas
we makin' money money never make us
gotta gig 9:30 at this club called boneshakers
and imma drop when i took it far as i could take us
The ringin' in my head is makin' me confused
how come the games we play we always lose?
how come you pick me up baby just to let me down the way you always do?
you've seen the lows the highs and still seemed surprised
can't stand hellos i can't stomach goodbyes
we've changed with time and soon you'll go your own way and i'll go....
I don't want you around or in my face
i'd rather not be a part of these foolish games
whenever i start thinkin about you i pause in my interviews
i think of you and everything starts fallin' into
I say it's hard it's hard to get back your friends
we don't ask we take they break they bend
so imma live this lie and watch a part of me die everyday i should play pretend
i've been holding this feelin' back so long...so long
it's in my everyday life and it's in my song
i'm damn near gone..even though it feels right you could be wrong...
I don't want you around or in my face
i'd rather not be a part of these foolish games
whenever i start thinkin about you i pause in my interviews
i think of you and everything starts fallin' into
So you know i told you this day would come
sometimes they walk other times they run
i could never be done until i find my day in the sun
so what to say when they wonderin' around my past?
you should know you were there so why did you ask?
i got yo number baby, i'll call if i should fall away too...
I don't want you around or in my face
i'd rather not be a part of these foolish games
whenever i start thinkin about you i pause in my interviews
i think of you and everything starts fallin' into

And yo muthafuckin chest, bitch, I done killed your protection
Bloody mess on yo chest, shoulda took yo yea and kept steppin

Shoestring's a killa on the for reala, I'll front you a O and a half
Turn around and set yo body up and leave you stiff on that Ave.

You want this click then suck this dick because this nigga scandal
I got the hand that rocks the cradle and'll light the candle
So if you ever wanna buck, nigga put it up
You got that toothpaste in yo safe and I'm a hit it up

Chorus (2X): I'm down in this muthafuckin dope game
(It's the diddy diddy dope deala, it's the diddy diddy dope nigga)
And the law can't fuck with me
(It's the diddy diddy dope deala, it's the diddy dope nigga)
[Bootleg]
I got the hand that rocks the cradle my blows are fatal just like
internal
bleedin
Run into the law from the cocaine keeps anigga speedin
Always on the bind on the grind for the 9-6
Gotta get my hustle on, came to nigga stiff
Bitch I'm to swift, stalkin with my big black boots
High on oop, with a MAC-11 ready to jack you for loot
Ain't you so cute, standin in the presence and essence of killas
A local bred tryin to fuck with thoroughbred niggas
No disrespect, betta grab yo tech before you swing my way
I put the comma in drama, pack heat like sunny days
Six million ways to die, let's try every one
She was raped and brutally beaten, murdered my job done
Now who got the flame, that comes a dime a dozen
I cock this 44 back, blow out yo shit, couldn't catch yo cousin
Cause if you owe me money, ain't shit funny when I catch you up
When I bust this tech, you'll think a supersoaker wet you up
The flames of hell is in my eyes, killin niggas by surprise
If you cross my path, bloodbath you bitches gotta die
Go ahead ??? with that moss, finally get tossed in the fuckin river
Sometimes they shiver, from the pain and pressure I deliver
Hold the hand of a gangsta as we fly through the bluest skies
Swim through the bluest seas, family of killa G's
Don't fuck with me nigga, I be yo local assassinator
A cop got mo digits than you can hold in a calculator
My finger's on the trigga, and that makes me fatal
Bootleg's a pimp, get off my dick, bitch, I got the hand that rocks
the cradle
Chorus (2X)
It's the diddy diddy what, the diddy diddy who
The diddy diddy's back for 96, I thought you knew
With some dope ass shit from the mind of a ganka
Straight up beat ya down and watch my niggas out think ya
It's the diddy diddy what, the diddy diddy who
The diddy diddy's back for 96, I thought you knew
With some dope ass shit from the mind of a ganka
Straight up beat ya down and watch my niggas out think ya
Chorus (2X)

Ha ha ha ha
Enter the Miclub this is where it all starts
Emcees defend they honor at all costs
Cycle of winners, this aint for beginners
I'm the sinner; state your name rank and business
When I pass you the mic, you better burn it
Don't be squirmish, you want respect, you gotta earn it
This is where we define purpose, how much heart lies beneath the surface
What's hidden behind the curtain?
Besides tight verses, nothing in life is certain
If you live as long as your words, you make life worth it
Writing rhymes gives me a buzz, I do this for the love
Welcome to the M I C Club......

[Drake - Verse 1]
Word on road, it's the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
[Hook]
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
[Verse 2]
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team
Man these niggas got to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next ting, YMCMB (ah)
[Bridge]
Ooh finally got you right here,
Tonight I'll ease your mind
That's why I'm calling on you,
And ooh soft your loves desire
It's hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all ties
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)
[Bridge]
[Outro]
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team (ay)
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team (ay)

Let's get 'em Happy
Go!
[Chorus]
Y'all ain't about nothing
Y'all ain't about nothing
Y'all frontin', y'all frontin, y'all frontin', y'all frontin'
Y'all niggas just hate, y'all niggas just hate
Y'all fake, y'all fake, y'all fake, y'all fake
You ain't finna do nothing, you ain't finna do nothing
Y'all frontin', y'all frontin', y'all frontin', y'all frontin'
Introducing to you now is the kid they love to hate
But when you saying what you saying
You just say it to my face
Yeah you see him? (Yeah)
You see him bow beat him down lean him down (lean him)
Your breathing sound like you now layin down sleepin
You be surrounded or found on the ground beaten
You see him how he look now and he ain't found a reason
My reason is that they won't have to persuade
Me to have the courage to walk right up and say it to your face
A faker never know he fake
A hater never admit he hate
By the time they figure it out is probably gon be too late (yeah)
Grinning up your face is like you tryin' to let me know
That you ain't really happy how how I'm getting all this dough
Let the truth be told tell me is your friend a foe
Better make it clear or get mistaken for a hoe (Yeah)
And then you take him to the floor
I can't ignore it if you're talking
But I hope that what you talking ain't about running up or robbing
Walk around like everybody is the enemy just for precaution (just for precaution)
I get no surprised and have to see an early coffin
[Chorus]
And what you smokin'. your brain clouded yet the pine got your mind polluted
You got some smarts in your mind hey it's time use it
Your friends arrive talkin down on the loud music
Them niggas's lying plus them concept is gettin' included
How could they tell you, you was built to last
You built like a boxing bag, put a whoopin' on that ass
See us approachin' that set in motion in that hour glass
Wrong words are built too fast, find your exit and dash
Lookin for crabs in a bucket tryin' criticize me (me)
But they do it around them niggas don't say it around me (me)
And if they do us opposite how they feel about me (me)
Turn my back and they relax and talk that lip behind me
I see you a busta and I'mma bust ya in your lip
Put some lipstick in my fist, throwin you a kiss
Since I see that you a sucker, suck a gasoline dick
Put it right up to your lip, put a lighter to the tip (boom!)
[Chorus]
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Act like you know I'm from the south
We ain't playin', what you sayin'?
I can't hear you when you talk
What you want? (What you want?)
What you sayin' out your mouth?
We ain't playin', what you sayin'?
I can't hear you when you talk
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Act like you know I'm from the south
We ain't playin', what you sayin'?
I can't hear you when you talk
What you want? (What you want?)
What you sayin' out your mouth?
We ain't playin', what you sayin'?
I can't hear you when you talk
[Chorus]

My peoples is watching you watching me
Lots of envy and hate is what it gots to be
I heard you tried to destroy my whole monopoly
But if I take it to ya face ya 'gon cop a plea
I know it but it's cool I know to watch you close
And if it comes to extremes I always got my toast
But you don't know that I know that you an evil nigga
'cause I'm laughin' and frontin' like I believe you nigga
You be thinkin' you fresh in your Moschino wear
And if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be nowhere
Huh, even ya crew knows you just too soft
I'm just waitin' for the right time to cut you off, for real
So keep thinkin' 'forever', you'll be down
But if you know this 'bout you, you got to kill me now
I'm sayin' 50 procent of my niggaz think it's them
And if you think it ain't you, you betta think again
[Chorus]
Pretty Boy
Niggaz I role with
Niggaz I stole with
Niggaz that hold shit
Niggaz that blow chicks, can you feel me baby?
(When you inside me Pretty)
Can I trust you baby?
(I never lie Pretty)
Plus you stay jiggy
(You keep me fly Pretty)
And I'ma treat you like my fifth on my side baby
And I'ma take you on some trips to the sky baby
And no matter what we do (ya know ya mine baby)
If it ain't my dogs, I ain't fuckin' with 'em
Shit, bitches ain't my crew, I ain't fuckin' with 'em
Think I trust ya'll? Caniving bitches, starvin' bitches
Always got ya eyes on my wrist-ass bitches
Think 'cause a bitch trapped, I won't layout bitches
Down with the 4 pound, and spray out bitches
Everything ain't rap, ya'll some snake-ass bitches
I ain't playin' with all ya'll hoes, O.K. ya'll bitches
Sling back to the hood, got the game back
Niggaz front the bodede, they keep yellin': "Fox get ya name back,
baby"
Brooklyn nigga, bet I stash you, young chick
Ballers and tailors and knee patches
'Memba that? Quart of juices, 3 quarter bomb magoosters
Two finger rings, with ya 2 tone jeans, frontin' like it's nuthin'
When everybody was born, now ya'll hoes fallin'
And want to knock 'me for mines
[Chorus]
Uh, now I wonda: "Am I at my peak?"
Is it just a dream or are they really after me?
Is it real? You never know what lies ahead of you
I'm kinda young, but my heart beats irregular
What do I do? Do I sit here and die slow?
They tried to kill me, mixin' angeldust and hydro
My eyes closed, what I'm sayin' must be sinkin' in
And if it didn't nigga, take ya time and think again
Uh...
[Chorus: x3]

You could thank me now
Uh, go 'head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay,
You could thank me now
Uh, yeah, well alright, here I go
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties
To men that I know well
That way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential
I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch,
What a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got the resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party, patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
O-V-O clique, Red wing boot gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
'cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
Yeah so on behalf of the demanded
And the entertainment that you take for granted
You could thank me now,
And oh my goodness you're welcome
You're welcome
At this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
But drink up because everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
You could thank me now
Uh, go 'head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay,
You could thank me now
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's
And low fat muffin's, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all
I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons or focus on your pro's
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow
Into women that are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allow
Where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning
You'll find it next to me
And tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
They say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
It's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the A-T-F in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry, poolside drinking
Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in the world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

Y'all can suck a dick, though

St. Louis to Atlanta, Atlanta to New York, New York to Cali. Worldwide!
You heard! Let's go.]
I know you cowards heard of me
You probably want to murder me
Ya hustlers to the third degree
I cut you like it's surgery
We hold court in the street and you committed perjury
Don't be nervous, B, the ambulance can't make this emergency
Urgently and purposely
I'm hurting the competitor who irking me is gon' be
Closed curtains, see
Blaze up the purple weed
The herbal trees give me the need to work a beat
Flow so for a hit that I deserve to be
Just work with me
Holy riders in my circle be
Not no rubber football but my turf with me
Think of jerking me
Out my dollar bills?
Beat that cat four months ago
And you can hear him holler still
Am I a G?
Certainly. So ain't no murking me
Phony cats be perping, B
While y'all dames be slurping me
Lurking, we creep at night
Pop on slight and hurt the beast
Nobody know where you at
Tell mama to search the streets
Hate it or love it. [x16]
[Spoken: I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck if you bitches don't like me
Eat a dick, nigga. I wasn't put on this Earth for you to like me, man

Ha ha! Uh huh
Don't ask me how my career doing. My career doing just fine

With all that gossip and bullshit. Let's go!]
Disrespect the clique, neglect the clique, the tec'll spit, we wreck this shit

Confess to this, I'm the next to hit
Back for the first time, still rep what's on my necklace bitch
Bitch! No, I can't cry about the past
Left Capitol and signed with Def Jam on they ass
Let's get mo' money, real fast, I'm in first, you still last
You the worst, I feel bad for you fags
I feel sad that I had to buy the new Range
Cause the Jag got crashed, my bad

But I don't care, and shit
Shit, I got rich from saying "Right Thurr" and shit
Hate it or love it. [x16]
[Spoken: Crazy, ain't it? That's wild, that's wild
It ain't even like I made the word up, nigga, that's how I talk

Getting money! That sound kinda cocky? So what? Fuck it! Get money!
Let's get it! But you know these motherfuckers everyday they always coming up to me asking me

You can do what ya please (hey)
The lap of luxury is what you'll be laying in just respect
The playa and the game that hes playing in (for real)
I can show you a side of life you never seen (huh)
Cause even the king of trill needs himself a queen
[Chorus]
See all that listening to them hoes in your ear gotta quit
I see they smile when I'm around when I leave
They talk shit they just mad cause I got you flipping jagos
Popping tags brand new clothes you cant tell by the tag
I don't mean to boast and brag but them hoes around you hating
They just waiting on you to slip so I could leave yo ass with nathan
Then when I do that they gon' back door and try to holla
Hoping I'm a do them like you and drop them off some dollas
But I ain't cause I can't afford to go back down that road
Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll
But I ain't cause I cant afford to go back down that road
Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll
But if you real and you down and in public you don't clown holla at me ill be around
(mike Jones) but if you real and you down
And in public you don't clown holla at me ill be around Yea
[Chorus]
I been putting it down nigga and holding my grounds
Nigga from off the mound nigga we ducking them clowns
Nigga taking they crown nigga and shoving the town
Nigga rocks off the ground got the cush by the pounds
Nigga ankle blingin' baby wrist on freeze got
The pinky on the ice love a bitch wit gold teeth nigga hot
Girl nigga loving the G keep the work under the seat
She do it for me take a trip to port her off to the beach
Tell her homie hold it down cause we hustle to eat
And got me feeling like I lost my Jones I done lost my horns
So H town is on and nothing change
Cause the palms got chrome nigga do this in the early
Cause we getting it on and baby girl you could shop alone
And fly the four to France and take a hundred bones
[Chorus]

For the record y'all, uh-huh
I know you hear me, for the record y'all
Dynasty album, track 16, listeners fret
I can't take back that sixteen
Shit the truth spoke, I gotta give the world true quotes
Can you feel it? I know the truth hurts
They say, "How can he disrespect his pop with harsh curses?"
Simple - harsh life, harsh verses
"I can't believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick,"
I know we gotta talk bout that, I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I don't like you
I got four kids, three baby mothers, I'm just like you
Sometimes I wanted to just fight you, shit
Swing on you - think I'm playin man, I'm just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle
With missing pieces tryin to put it together dawg, you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Ridin the same water, same situation
Same fatherless daughter - I hate you, that's in your mind
Don't get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now
Don't be a hater now, be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say, for the record, check it
[Chorus]
Still got love for you, though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone, and make it on my own
I still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain
It's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way
Listen - that was my hurt in my heart talkin, along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing self-esteem issues
Round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise I minused my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play space, cards face up, I've come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
Your lack of love, left me loveless, and I'm of your breath
I'm your mind body and soul, your heart, your flesh
Your alcohol, your smoke, in results I'm a mess
And dad, still I love you no less dad
Hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
But not mad, just disappointed - we wasted years
I swear to God, may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
How could you let me grow without you?
Grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
Wear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?
Family pictures pose without you - WHY?!
Why shouldn't I be mad?
Monster's parents separated, Monster had his dad
These parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
He bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
Used to have to butt my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong, let's move on

My Nigga Lou, Willies
You know how we do it
That platinum shit
Word up!

Feel this cage when that acid fade
Face the same but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home
I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome
Plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors
Guess he isn't home
Probably 'cause that fucking faith I didn't show
Skippin church, flip the work
Hit a dirt, like Tommy run it bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasn't in
Came up of of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasn't hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty they ain't dollar top lotto picks
Promise that I am not the one to fucking plot against
Love him, but my father ain't my mother fucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a mother fucking end
Trend dodging, keep a bitch by me
Back roll
Garbage bag full of sand
Place myself the rap stale
Cash is in hand
Packs get vac sealed
Like the Tin Man
Cardiac Stillness
Missing past real, in it, words make dentists
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, don't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, don't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups
My mama wonder why it never seem to reach
See my Daddy in the way I'm acting
And my facial features
Just trying to put you on
Dog I came from teachers
Take the plate and clean it
Nigga I'm a dog
Tell her hit or miss me with the fucking monologue
Lord I can't fight it
Know I'm tryna brawl
Get a cop a hog dog chick
I'm the type of nigga that you cop your raw off
Popping hoes off
Grab the board and these niggas call charge
Chain switches jerseys like it's all star
Press the on star
Think it's all lost

Genabis, this is Genabis
Remember this
Yo, in the beginning I discovered wordplay
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
On the fourth, I searched for the words to say
How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space
I was perfect at it and mastered the tactic
On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics
On the sixth day I became a fanatic
And I couldn't kick the habit, I would just look in the mirror and practice
On the seventh cycle I had to take the day off
I was exhausted, I guessed my work would never pay off
But if it happened to Him, it could happen to me
And if it happened to me it was destined to be
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the Cosmos, what God wrote, predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the Cosmos, what God wrote, predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
As they backslide back to church and call the minister's bluff
They'd rather remain unenlightened than listen to Bus
I blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt
I was the first rapper to ever close orbit the sun
One small step for man, one huge step for mankind
I am the Red Giant of rhymes
Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second
Flow is untested, those that I've threatened fold under pressure
At one hundred and twenty beta cycles
High volts ignite your eyeballs until you see the fire in front of you
Optic cones and rods melt one at a time until you realize you're in Hell
Rip the Jacker's not done with you
I terrorize the rap community with impunity
Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris
What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me
Those in pursuit of me will never get through to me
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the Cosmos, what God wrote, predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the Cosmos, what God wrote, predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Fist rapper to speak over beats dogmatically
Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy
My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly
Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me
Notice the post-Renaissance pictures I drew
Hand-sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca, Peru
The following audio propagates the possible truth
To prove I'm the illest so the choice is not up to you
See, the standard ideological definition of a rap model
Is Canibus' scholarly-periodicals?
The article is substantially impressive
More than a message, a working thesis
From several different perspectives
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative
Entered Apprentices this is Genabis
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative

Conversation bout this kid Killa Bamz
You want defense man to man location Shaolin New York
It ain't nuthin' to talk or walk
Get dark son economic times to fault
Style is mangohead stagnated from soft
What the fuck you thought, we was given support?
Live from Beatdown, Shaolin success, bypass the rest
Move sixty deep, Dutch with the charm
One hundred, twenty arms, designed to unleash bombs
Holdin' dart guns in palms
One hundred divine cyphers, Killa Bamz
I pack the dart gun hate to see another death in the fam
Uhh, yeah, what

Tongue blade of fury, nurse the wound leary weary
Teary fear me, clearly, the pearl drop
Time stop, holdin' shop, shockwave be brave
Ghetto came style is maim out to lunch
Out to crunch munch rhyme foods, my life reflect the jewel
My life control the cruise, ten deadly touches too
Grip the Dutches move, swing rough to cut ya

Vanglorious darts, brown skinned with the pen
Pioneer shift from the beginning to the end
Whatever I do, y'all imitate -- try to come close
But can't come straight; I branch out
Terrorize scenes, split tracks, split hats
Bare facts, guns, crazy funds, a thousand sons
That'll rain on your gang, you're too plain
My dope is uncut, high level high like a plane
Bigger bite bigger mic underground beneath these streets
W-T-see, leaky leak
Time meet, Chi meet, ain't nuttin' sweet
Pakistan, Iran clan is like Christ
Word to Poltergeist, smash every tape
Deep thoughte, out of order, off
Seven thirty, bugged like psycho from the Bronx
Wild like fat pen child to be the rap Lawrence Martin
Eyes like lills, mescaline pills
Three bills worth of darts, pump the heart
Bottom of the chart, slug art closin' you in once again
It's the all time great, demonstrate, vocabulary execution
Executive approachin', Tang a demonstration
Pillage Incorporated, first place
A thai clean like a plant, eight time writer champ
Lamp on the beatbreak, camp on verses
Cheat on producers, men go working
Rhymes make a mill-in, born Park Hill'n
Internal lyrics, expose the profane
Vote for Cappadonna and your whole life'll change
Pump up your fist
Pump up your fist
Pump up your fist
If you love this shit

Pump up your fist
Pump up your fist
If you love this shit

[ CHORUS ]
Come on and let the games begin
Cause the games begin when you're coolin with your friends
And the friends to the end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts
[ VERSE 1 ]
It's time to max, relax, ask anybody
You got off work, you know your boss is a jerk
Whether you a clerk or a rapper like me
We all need to kick back and be carefree
See, no plead-bargainin, no haboring
Negative attitudes when you're out with your dudes
Damn, it feels good when the weekend comes
Done finished the homework, you're out with the bums
Clownin, you're all down in whatever goes
You throw on a tape and hear a nigga kick his flows
Cruise down the strip and pop at some hoes
y'all still havin fun no matter what scenario you chose
Even on a solo with hoes, take off your clothes
But not without the condoms cause that's ( ? )
Those wake up the next day call your partners
Pitch in four or ten and start the festivities
No fuckin worries when you're livin free of stress
That's why we only smoke bomb, fuck sess
y'all feel the best when y'all say let's act a fool
Cause it's June and it's cool cause we out of school
[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2 ]
Your friends are your friends like no matter what
Other fools get cut from your team
It seems like they dream of gettin next to you
But all they really do is pester you
Cause they marks, always want to start funk when you with em
Cause when he got beef with a nigga he thinks y'all'll get him
Now he rollin with yo crew, but with no crew
He wouldn't be poppin doodoo
His ass would be through, but now he drug you into it
And yes, all your boys
And now you gotta kill the noise
He destroys the whole vibe by frontin
Tryin to be hard
But he just Napoleon Bonaparte
A little nigga tryin to take command
Thinkin he the man
But fuckin with him y'all'll all kick the can
I can't stand a fake
I kick it with my real niggas come spring break
That's the ones I look out for, never doubt your pals
Fuck them gals and don't ever let em separate you
Your friends ( ? ) when that bitch hates you
And I say
[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3 ]
Now when you got business to attend
Take care of that and afterwards fuck with your friends
Don't put shit off till tomorrow
Do it right now 'fore you fuck with your pals
That's the down period, rest and relaxation
At the nigga Plus' house, let's go to Nations
And get fits, when life is the pits
You know I check my friends, make sure they legit
Whether it's freestylin you know we smilin
Niggas pilin up with the gin in a cup
Or a blunt and Olde English so niggas can get fiendish
Playin NBA Jams and just like the beats we slam and dunk
Callin niggas punks but we just poppin junk
Playin dozens, cause we like cousins
And brothers, I wouldn't have it any other way
You know what they say, all work and no play
Et cetera

We bought to back it on up in the parkin' lot got the beer
On ice and the grill is hot on your mark
Get set baby ready or not we gonna get some

[Slug]
Yeah, I saw the sign in the window, for the job
Yeah I got a high school education, but that's all
Skills? You wanna know if I got some skills?
Yeah I got some skills
This goes out to all my friends
What you gonna be when you grown up?
I'm all grown up and still don't know what
I might throw up, I rock a tow-truck
Long as it means that I can get old and post up
I used to be a typical winner
Living off the gratuity from delivering your dinner
Cause as a kid, I didn't consider
that I would get the opportunity to be a full-time spitter
I love this occupation
I got bosses across the nation
Validation is an understatement
and I don't really know how to take a vacation
My kind don't have any free time
I'm so distracted, but everything's fine
I speak shine and I read signs
Appreciate your opinion but this dream's mine
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell a cowboy what to do
I was the ugly kid that didn't listen
Little big man full of ambition
Based on imagination, just like you
Daydreaming, thinking bout the things I might do
I used to paint, draw and illustrate
Mom would facilitate and it would feel okay
Seems like yesterday still plays a part
When I grow up, I wanted a job making art
Picture that, how many years old?
Young enough to mix up love with career goals
But I was just this tall when they told me
that the world was mine, but the papers weren't signed
There's no deed, so proceed to go seed
up the whole piece like it owes me groceries
Don't breathe until you formally know me
Won't leave? Better call authorities
It's all love, we're cool
But you tell an astronaut what to do
The turntables stole my heart
Burnt the paintbrush, broke it apart
I miss it, I might revisit
But I wasn't that good, I admit it, maybe you can't tell
But as a kid, I wanted to be Melle Mel
And later as a teenager I wanted to be LL
Then I discovered weed and I wanted to be Del
But thank God eventually I found myself
It's funny when I bump into fools
I used to go to school with, and they ask what I'm doing
Half of the time I want to crack a lie
But fuck it, I'm still a wannabe rapper guy
Hahaha, yeah I guess that it seems that way
I get to see the world, and it's decent pay
As long as somebody want to see us play
I wake up every morning and I seize the day
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell the president what to do
It's like that y'all, it's like this y'all
I don't get to call in sick y'all

[Juelz Santana]
Oh, come on, fuck with your boy
It's Santana, Heatmakers, where we at?
Let me see you through this
Killa, Jones, Freakay
Yeah man, I'm back at it
Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm "Gon' Til' November"
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggaz, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please)
I see a town I'm likin'
See some niggas getting money in a town I like it
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like it's my block now, all right kid?
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out, ranged out the side of his right ear
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that pyrex vision
Pop, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitchin'
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm livin
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flippin' the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math
[Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive in the city where the skinny niggas die?
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way
Jose or Hector Camacho
Tech blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker I'm the best, I told y'all before
I should y'all before, ey!
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flippin' the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math
[Cam'Ron]
I'm on the westside of Chicago, lookin' for a bust down
And make me put my two arms up, Touchdown!
You stay in touch now, but when I tough down
I'm like Buckshot shorty, you better "Duck Down"
Yeah I must clown, I'm from Harlem, Uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, what now?
Birds flip a dozen, chicks is dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, toys kissing muppets
Worst then that, they go home and kiss they husband
That shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons buggin'
This on my wrist is nothing
To me it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhymin'
You fucking with Pablo, Bravo, Mario Via Bolo ho, Ta-to
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flippin' the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math

Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue

Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions, I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead but I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face, I'm in a better place gettin' better head
I just wanna stay broke forever, yeah that's that shit no one ever said

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've gotta land and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up, that conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
G's dope, he might blow up, think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
'Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it

I think we all try to be good people.
But it's just things you go through that make you who you are
Nigga this is how you made me (This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)
Nigga this is how you made me (This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)
Hol' up
Last time I trust a nigga he betrayed me
Last time I trust a bitch, she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
Thinking 'bout my old girlfriend, lil mama played me
Left me for some light skin cat with a Mercedes
Back then I didn't have no whip, had to upgrade me
Now I got those white boy M's, she ain't as shady
Well karma is a bitch baby
Oh you wasn't tryna chill hoes? (Remember that?)
One day karma kicks you in the ass
And I hope she wearing steel toes
Tried to have my head all twisted, won't let 'em braid me
I just gotta be who I be, don't let it jade me
Life gave me lemons, it's time to lemonade me
Music to my ears, the lies just serenade me
And what they done to me, I done it to the next
What goes around is coming to you next
I dress like I'ma run into my ex
And every time I run into her flex, uh
Last time I trust a nigga he betrayed me
Last time I trust a bitch, she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
Your boy tried to fuck me over, thought we was homies
Guess he was a h-o-e when I say hoemies
Niggas get some money then act like they don't know me
Got a new phone, cut off the old phonies
'Cause they ain't never pick up for me when I used to call
And they ain't never pass the 'roc when they used to ball
And they ain't never help me up when I used to fall
Kept tryna do it big, fuck gettin' used to small
After the success it's like yes they used to know me
Now it ain't no 'Neneh nigga, I got Naomi
Shoulda paid attention before you haters owe me
Since you down there on your knees, go ahead and blow me
Suck a dick, tell a hater suck a dick
Just a hood nigga that hit a fuckin' lick
I keep my head up and I ain't never duckin' shit
I'm self made, I don't owe a mother fucker shit, boi
Last time I trust a nigga he betrayed me
Last time I trust a bitch, she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
This is how you made me
Niggas say I'm actin' crazy
But this is how you made me
So don't try to change me
But nigga this is how you made me
This is how you made me
Nigga, nigga this is how you made me

[Intro - Ace Hood]
Yeah
Yay, straight up like that there B homie
Free Weezy!
Yay, let's get to the money my nigga
Mister Hood
[Chorus] X2
Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking
Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking
Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking
I run it myself like a quarter back option
[Verse 1 - Ace Hood]
Okay there's money to be made
Let's go get this guap
And I'm fresh up on the block
Rubber band in my pockets
Nigga run it like I'm shock it
Balling like John Stockton
Couple stacks in my pocket
What the fuck is a wallet?
Nigga show me what you need oh
Call me the Young Nino
All I see is the C-notes
Triple digits and zeros
Nigga keep it on the D low
While I'm stacking the Fritos
I get the shit by you know
Send it to Puerto Rico
Nigga never move by two though
Tell them that's what it do though
Just bring my money back
Yeah I'm talking Polo
Nigga money to be made
That's money to be made
And if this ain't your shit
Then nigga you ain't getting paid
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Ace Hood]
Okay now hundred thousand dollars
That's around my collar
Nigga I should see a doctor
Addicted to them dollars
Nigga holler (Holler) holler (Holler) holler (Holler)
Fuck off with you cowards
Just feed me with the money nigga
Watch how I devour
Nigga it's raining money
Watch I take a shower
All you niggas lame
Nine to five scholar
Nigga you be picking flowers
My hand is so tired
Counting for an hour
My accountant cannot follow
Nigga money to be made
All my niggas paid
Fresher than a mug in the latest fucking J's
And your bitch be on my dick though
Wet as fucking Crisco
As soon as we be done nigga, back onto that cash flow
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - AC]
You ain't got to tell me
But now the kush in my Louis V. duffle
Bet a nigga smell me
You little nigga, I'm better nigga
If any nigga tell me, that money ain't here pronto
Then I bet them chopper shells be arriving at his front door
I got to step up on my guns so
I see you from a distance
I'm in love with all this money
I ain't see some for you bitches
I do it because I want to
Clueless because I'm under
Influence of this Goosey but my fooleys make me wonder
Are they really hustling? Look at all these bundles
Are they really human? They eat you like piranhas
Look at my G-shock and you can tell a nigga clocking
I know them hoes watching but it's
[Chorus] X3

[Hook: Active Child]
Everything reminds me of you
I think I'm losing my mind
Staring at your face in the rearview
And I can get all of the time
Nolita, Nolita
Nolita
Nolita, Nolita
[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]
Yea, lookin back on a life that I thought that I could never have
Spent time with a woman I thought that I could never match
Broke all my ties to the chick that caught them feelings fast
I fall in love to that mother skunker, jumped all on my back
That's when I meet you, the girl with the dragon tattoo
Black eyes, cold hips in a black coupe
With that fast zoom and that Vera Wang
In them Christian Lou's
With a voice full of heaven I stand to lose
With a heart to say I don't steal shit
I'm a real bitch
Independent, no dick goin' make me kill this
So pressed up on her
Ride right at the moment, she said if you want it
You better holy matrimony, woah
I'm cool, rolling with them punches
But I'm only down for your loving
Back rub when we cuddling
My thug passion, you be lovin it
Get lost in the town, we make the time
That's when it all happen, champagne glasses
Drunk off passion
With a little bit of lust and a little bit of you
And a little bit of face sucking off this mood
You keep your head down with no panties on
Adina Howard with no cameras on
Your light's low but your body's on
You tie me to the bed post
Fuckin me off the edge though
Bathtub, hot salt water
Rose pedals with that blunted sour
Talkin' dirty in the darkest hour
With all of my best
I put your engagement ring on the desk
Everything was set
But then you left
[Hook: Active Child]
[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
I was left in the dark
I was left in the cold
I was left getting old
With no idea why you kept a secret so long
It's been three years since I've seen you
And my heartbeat still needs you
I can't find a number to reach you
And your whereabouts to meet you
So I gave up, hit the road
Concert after concert
And city after city, getting drunk with some stupid hoes
Ridin through the city with the big lights
Downtown, tryna feel life
In a glora kadan with a glass of Henny
And a bad chick to my right
Smellin like my past
What the fuck's in my drink
When I realized what I'm next to
Matching dragon tattoos
It was you, it was you all along
And you was fuckin' yo ex girl
A body of lies and I'm blessed girl
And I hate loving yo sex girl
I was yo experiment but I died, you kicked dirt on my grave
And for what? To get a taste for dick you fuckin bitch
[Bridge: Active Child]
Everything reminds me of you
I think I'm losing my mind
Staring at your face in the rearview
And I can get
[Hook: Active Child]
[Outro: Active Child and Gilbere Forte]
Nolita, Nolita
Nolita
Fucked up
You know, I ain't even really
See it comin from somebody like that
You know I never liked love
I fuckin hate me

He plays the sweetest melody.
When I hear, it takes over me.
And I feel every strum of the strings.
It reminds me of all the things we used to be.
Can't breathe at all cause you're coming.
Coming through my speaker, speaker

Everytime I mind you, mind you
everytime I'm by him, by him.
You're ripping it up on them chords,

Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar.
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar.
It kills me that I can't be with you,
thought I was the key you're playing.
Don't know I just gotta, be the one you let bleed out.
Wish I didn't know you, got me feeling stuck.
I can't let you go, just my luck.
Falling down without you,

And now I cant get you off my head.

Coming through my speaker, speaker

Scholarship apology

Girls like, "we love you, we go to LSU
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "Faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be

Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' like I'm feelin'

Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Fire fly

DPS forever hit ya' with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff
V Love, that's my money like dominoes
Brooklyn do keep it rocking till the sun shows
I pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, Pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue, in color sound
???? that play my crew couldn't walk the new found
I chalk the new sound
I bop like Teddy Charles was burning
when I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist, with a fist
Proletariat, Cad-i-lac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now, I'm making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make 'em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grass in my pockets I release my hot rockets
K.B. said "What you give 'em?" I was like "Mad rhythm."
That's my junk
Eric ???? always hits me with the live stuff
Bahamadia back the sounds with the love love
T.J. and Lisa real peoples 89 and still
In Fort Green on diamond back is where I'm at
Feelin' da funk da funk that's in the trunk the trunk
I feel the funk da funk, feelin' the funk da funk
I'm feelin' funk da funk I'm in the trunk da trunk
Feelin' da funk da funk, I am the funk
I raise everyday for the mass
Tote my fist right up right against the fascist
Descend to my borough digs my diction
It's way on time ????
So watch fifth line still shining
I'm left this year a ???? player
In my vein lives bell hooks Derrick Bell, Reggie Butler
See Marvin knew it, and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals ???? in M.C.s with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin
I'm saying a Digable swinger
Word to mouth brought the clout 'specially in the summer
We vanish like vapor
Burn paper
We deal real-real so chill
We linger in the funk
Yes Yes, bus stop what's (Watts) up
On the script side
Low down the whole mix and flips I 63
Jay be	and M.C. baby blue great
Do it fluent keep it real and straight
We make it bump de bump, we make it bump se bump
We make it pump se pump, we make it bump
Save your corny missions for the tracks you lying on
We got ammunition for the streets we dying on
Stones, rocks, subways, blocks, chill mode
Loot fold
Rebel wit no pause down to die for cause be-cause
Denia gotta see a fatter day
It's Saturday I'm looking at the streets as my Nikes
Cover asphalt ???? the night
My weight crush trash broken glass
Play the wall with one foot up
"Yo What up Ish?", "What's up."
The flyer we get the higher we get
Good try-ers
Is good die-ers that it so I move
We showed and we prove
It's groove food
What's going on
You want to see knowledge born, see see Knowledge Born
Before we fall victim we lick 'em
I ain't playin'
Meet me at the corner Murder and Adolpha
I bless you with some joints, the mental hollow points
We do it in the park, we do it in the park
That's right, that's right
We do it in the park, we do it in the park
I'm fluent after dark, in any sit-e-ation
My tools, jewels, the nation
That's how we bump

Rival gangsters sit down to plan an after school program
A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project
A group of teenage boys watches a video of a father playing catch with his son
An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples fully clothed an smiling
A record executive records a demo of his apology
A policeman makes reverse 911 calls instructing residents to take to the streets
A patriarch reports for duty
She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign
She's ashamed of her birthplace, but retreat is not an option
Women and children
Front line
Log on
Tune in
Stand and be counted, wounded, stationed
In the belly of the vulture watch your back
Theres no civilians
Women, children
Front line listen
Consider this a distant early warning
The fires imminent
Pollution gathering dust particles
Funneling through smokestacks, airways, bandwidth
This information tube fed
Check the labels
Delete the virus
Alert the masses
Butterfly wing cross wings,send black hawks toward hurricane survivors
Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks
Pacifist gorillas move undetected, through concrete jungles
New forms are beginning to take shape
Once occupied minds are activating.
People are waking up!
The insurgency is alive and well
Rise of the flobots
Portrait of
The new American insurgent
Rattle and shake the foundations of the world order
Assembly line incent, resist, refuse
Inform, create
Direct loved one's to the trenches
Suit up forge rubble into fortress's
Plaster, cloth, aluminum
Broken porcelain
Rusted platinum
Burn blood stains from decompressed diamonds
Hammer the battle cry into braille studded armor

Put that bitch in smash mode!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
Motherfucker let's go
Yeah-yeah, let's go
Put your back into it like you Grandma do it, let's go
A-Town!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
[Chorus]
I knew I was wrong for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
{And one and two, now you know what to do}
My nigga what was I to do, but find someone else
(Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan)
This is how it starts
Momma fell heel over head and says you was the one
Big Boi, but she calls me Antwan
So just for fun, I went along with hon
I was young, full of cum, done for the skeet skeet, not dumb
We would meet undiscretely discrete
She in heat like bitch on a leash (BITCH!)
No disrespect, but metaphorically she's a beast
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding til we got slimey
Yeah, from that sweet stick thang, can't complain
I was hooked on the box like the hot Krispy Cremes
[Chorus]
Well it didn't take long for me to game peep
It was week after week, I was seeing the same freak
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy's on the dice
I might (might) just put you on the chopping block tonight
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
But if you freaking, I'm speaking clean as a whistle
This'll be the last official offer before dismissal
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding til we got slimy
Yeah, got the latex for the fit
Because she trying to trick Daddy,
Slip-N-Slide on this dick!
[Chorus]
You are not the one, you are not the one
You can be my two, you can be my two
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
[Chorus]
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
Now two, now two, I'mm give her back to you
I'm through, nigga
I don had enough of the nast stuff
One, two, yeah!

"Murder? Yeah murder one son, for the death of Jane" [Repeat: x4]
Hey yo they came to my jail cell, and let me go on technicalities
The girl that got merked it wasn't Jane it was fucking Valerie
The prostitute from downtown, we checked the dental records
Found her butt naked, and on the side EPMD record
Two hours later on Greyhound, on my way now
Peeped the shorty up front, staring wants to play now
Set gets laid out, she black, draws the gat
Screaming 'lay flat' then bust a cap as she walk back
Remain cool, I want the money quality jewels
And anybody breaking these rules they get two's
This is a jack, pass the money back, no eye contact
Relax, and keep quiet and pass the bag back
to my accomplice, having no nonsense
That's when another girl pushed up, white girl on some calm shit
Thinking quick that's when the hammer went click
An off-duty P.O., licked off and touched first bitch, she fell
Hit the floor, she was leaking
My partner cock back, blast, one woman started screaming
Who's next? Who wanna flex? Cop in the seat wet
Licked another shot off, hit the driver then the bus tipped
Shit's thick, that's when she grabbed me took me hostage
Told me 'snatch the bags and don't fuck with my props kid'
Pistol still smoking, she kicked the fucking door open
Bus on it's side wheels spinning, with the engine smoking
Running on the shoulders, she put the gat in the holster
Played it cool, and never lost my composure
As screaming soldier got closer, I followed her to the
drop point, she took the leads off a Range Rover
and passed me the keys, proceeded to roll trees
Shorty gained her silence, guess what was in the CD
And as I did the knowledge the Jeep raised from the hydraulic
I'm thinking, "Could this be Jane as my co-pilot?"
Time to activate, JANE on the license plate
Pushing ninety-five with no headlights, on the interstate
"Murder? Yeah murder one son for the death of Jane" [Repeat: x8]

Bread and water..This what it comes down to
[Verse 1]
I remember when these kids got killed up in Pearl
Is it the end of the world? Grown men acting like bitches
Bitches actin' like men, and it's all good
As long as all these records keep sellin'
Niggaz time cut so these snitches keep tellin'
Y'all know it ain't right..
And I ain't bending for these hoes
Is this the part when my God comes back and starts throwin' elbows?
Man these children gone astray, and no daddies in the home
So they turn to gun play, or they just turn gay
Half-bit like they rich broke, niggaz swisha sweet
So I sit, in a lac and just smoke,stayin' down in the street
Vernon Dixon? Georgetown in the hills
The subs and the boys in Hattiesburg so trill
The delta and coast, the queens is what I boast
But these kids in the south is what a nigga love the most
{Bridge}
Damn, the kids is what a nigga loves most
Fuck, so trill..
[Hook 2x]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
[Verse 2]
I remember when the twin towers fell
Did the boys in the G know, or just didn't tell?
I ain't forgot about Gore, and them trick ass ballots
Numbers tossed around in the mix like a salad
Or a bird in the Bush
Or a brother up in office tryna give a big push
Y'all don't try to praise God now
He been watchin from the jump, I'ma crunk
Quick to pull the sawed pump, skull and bones y'all can kill me
I'ma G, and the world is gon' feel me
Bet you neva thought the truth would come straight from the middle of Mississippi
So P-Boy keep pushin'..
We some big ones,life would street, man we all on a mission
[Hook 2x]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
[Verse 3]
This for my boys in the pen and my thugs on the county farms
If it's war then I swear I'm gonna raise them arms
And come and getcha, send me a kite...
And I promise that I'll write ya back or smoke a fat sack in ya name
I ain't no bitch or no hoe or no trick
Tryna ride a nigga dick just to make a quick hit
I ain't writin' love songs for prissy bitches
I make songs for the queens who lost sight in the hood
Mayne I made some bullshit but it's good
And if ya see me then you see this shit across my chest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest
[Hook until fade]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

[Aesop Rock and Dose One]
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black man on a white horse
Or a white man on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing at random
Princess, raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)
Har-bour (???) [said like har-bow?]
And it goes a little something like this..
[Aesop Rock]
New walk in a broken sole (???), pedigree incessant
Got (Gut?) the cruddy (???) frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cut-throats the result of pope jokes soaked in poacher constants
And now the jewel emits cold, wander prominent.. honour (honour)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
So you first bought a stitch
Joined damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage
[Dose One]
So you mean these things are worth money
Now drifting off
This is the who-you-calling-homeless
Mock me fearful
Twisted ???? ???? and I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, Ichabod (???)
Running out of most (???) from the Alamo (???) we're moseying
My kind of people ???? ???? ???? ???? moseying (???)
With my eyes patched ???? ???? ???? universe
So I back it and gave my verdict (???) ???? ???? ???? ????
[Aesop Rock]
Oh it'll be soon (real soon)
???? ???? immune to doom blends
I eat ditch (???) in the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow, sorry
Looking not at hopefuls (???), where's the raindance
My little flint never dreamed would flood unpotable
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming)
Hmm, yo why not be a czar, analyze fallen heroics
Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it
Who put the fun in dysfunctional? I..
Chronicle sun combustible, donkey-punching pinholes
In uncomfortables and conjunctionals for good (good)
Dr-rink up, slop a goblet of dirt wine (???),
I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine
[Dose One]
Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and plastic bag
Now sunk around his head (???) sick-sick-sick-sick... (???)
???? ???? ????
The sickness likeness in the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag
???? ???? ???? ???? ????...
And brought on out...
And clouds...
The hiss cuts out... (???)
Suppose it's noise...
And the piano...
And the window frrraame... (???)
Sky and dirt that's fresh... kept
From where I'm going... holy other
Holy other, holy other, holy other...
[Aesop Rock]
be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-But
I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
[Dose One]
And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
That was to be in vain
You shoulda locked that up when you're all finished
Finished yet? Now uhm...
I usually finish this number with uh... my skull up (???)
[Aesop Rock]
Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Then the masses want to lean on me like 'O Captain, my Captain'
Not considering maybe this oarman hosts orbit attachments...
[Dose One]
Button, button, who's got the button (???)
Take my name, please...
Button, button, who's got the button (???)
Leaks the little checker-men made out of lightning in my ????
Oh, you like to help with goats (?!?) see what I got in this here locket
[Aesop Rock and Dose One]
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black man on a white horse
Or a white man on a black horse
And I can't forget the not-so-perfect bow around the middle
Har-bour (???)

Bah, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
I see you sit
And swallow pain
For all of those
Who will not speak
You raise your voice
You fill the stage
Your eyes are wide
You know the weakness
That you've felt
Is not just yours
So many more
You're not alone
The songs you sing are not your own
You fill the room with something real
You never had it
Keep on wanting something more
You never had it
Keep on wanting something more
You've never had it so you hesitate to try and find it
You listen carefully for whispers of what lurks behind it
You play the corners
Never get too close to where it might be
Waiting for you
Never had it
Keep on wanting something more
Keep wanting more
You never had it
Keep wanting more
You never had it
Keep hiding the hope and than the pain is not yours
No ones holding a rope gotta pull up on your own
All the songs have been sung
And all the doors have be closed
Keep on wanting more (keep on wanting)
I watch you wander through these halls
You slouch, you shrug, you shrink away
I call you stop you blink you pause
You wander who
You think the day
Will never end
But when it does
You stay until the building's dark
You're on the bus
The doors are locked
You looked inside
But did not touch
You never had it
Keep on wanting something more
You never had it
Keep on wanting something more
You've never had it
But you know how to provide it so you
Stand up and call for it
Nervous describing what you go through
You don't wanna get caught up in all the
Things they say to try to provoke you
Don't need anyone to tell you
Keep on wanting something more
[Repeat: 2X]
Keep wanting more
You never had it
Keep wanting more
You never had it
Bah, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Bah, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba

Mirror boy, rhyme with dada convention
Psychoanalysis didn't mean anything
Pvc costumes, letters to castro
Show me what you're reading, freaky girl with the afro
Franz fannon, yeah yeah I get it,
All that curiosity with something to offset it
Diagrams and plans, drawn in secret locations
Scientific babies, they be peddling information
The queen, she's smoking prozac, we be smoking napalm
The verbal countries, they be smoking atom bombs
I wrote a book in the year seven-ten
By nineteensixty-nine I had written more
If you're feeling insecure,
Cause you're living in a storm
If you find them, you can burn them,
If you burn them you can keep warm
Them winds of change, they be bringing change,
Especially now there's prostitutes on ilford lane
You see, it's kinda like, but no, it's not the same thing
See there were men on the moon, but they killed them
Bearing in mind, my mind's soul food
Bearing in mind, my mind's aquarian
Bearing in mind, my mind's mine
Times being what they are, radar
Bearing in mind yes yes, y'all
Bearing in mind, there's nothing in it
Bearing in mind, my mind's mine
Times being what they are, radar
Aeroplanes in my room,
And I don't know who's flying them
They're playing that tune
It's okay, I got my eye on them
They're making their messages out of them smokes
Words evaporate, I can't read what they wrote
Their language is so strange, I never seen it's kind
The smell of them vapors be taking my mind
Combined with that melody, them engines be humming
I pick up my mike, I put it down
See now I'm outside in, I don't know where I'm going
I gets in my car, I starts rowing
But like the water is seeping
It's getting in through the bottom
I tickle them fish
Swallow them whole, now I got some
Bones, sticking in my throat
Has anybody seen my universal antidote
Bearing in mind, my mind's soul food
Bearing in mind, my mind's aquarian
Bearing in mind, my mind's mine
Times being what they are, radar
Bearing in mind yes yes, y'all
Bearing in mind, there's nothing in it
Bearing in mind, my mind's mine
Times being what they are, radar
Don't even think 'bout it
Don't even contemplate
Before the funk goes to your head
You better stop and wait
Don't even think 'bout it
Don't even contemplate
Before the funk goes to your head
You better stop
Don't even think 'bout it
Don't even contemplate
Before the funk goes to your head
You better stop and wait
Don't even think 'bout it
Don't even contemplate
Before the funk goes to your head
You better stop
And still it's cool, like they does it in egypt
I say come to that river man, but nobody's seen it
Believe that, cinematic, atmospheric
Panasonic my headphones, ain't nothing on it
Bonnets on cars, magazines, girls on harleys
We's sneaking up on babies, and we's eating thems farleys
I don't know where my girl is, oh well, somebody took her
Fixing those strings as she sings mr hooker
Spikey hair my head, since I cut off my dreads
I got the green fishs tail, set sail on a moped
Jean of arc's on the back, trying not to fall off
Valentines park, hip hop, set it all off
It's like I'm on a solitary exhibition
It's like you see me everywhere, but you still know that I be missing
Pissing in the wind as I'm lookin' for them answers
In seventies movies and topless dancers
Bearing in mind, my mind's soul food
Bearing in mind, my mind's aquarian
Bearing in mind, my mind's mine
Times being what they are, radar
Bearing in mind there's nothing in it
Bearing in mind yes yes, y'all
Bearing in mind...
Times being what they are, radar

"Everybody got dreams of makin cash money"
(Chorus-Iriscience)
Trade money
Different color and shape money (money)
Money that looks funny but never no fake money
Make money, money, but please don't waste money
We don't love money but we don't hate money
(Evidence)
Yo, if you live day to day then you proabably live life
More than a cat who got a Benz, bank roll and a wife
'Cause yo, I seen a lot of folks whose so-called success equals depress
And look up to broke peeps who hold mics now
Play the role, reverse and understand
Your friend with no dough might be closer to earth
Take the pressure off the weight and see how it equates
If you hold yourself back to make papes, get it straight
(Iriscience)
You can use cash for tools, to get parks and pools
Community centers, rec rooms and schools
Book money, off the books and food money
Rent money, electronic money and crew money
First thing, flippin over dollars, searching
For the eye in the chief corner stone in thirteen
Stay beyond hungry and thirsty, ("dilated")
We're damn near starvin and we're dehydrated
(Chorus) 2x
(Iriscience)
No credit, everybody has to pay
Dope music, spittin everything from hash to yay
Watch the traffic or you're gonna bring crash this way
Then have 'em swingin at my door like Cassius Clay (no matter)
The game don't exist without roles and rules
But comma manifest as the golden rule
Rolled on wheels in the eighties, they would jack them fools
Flashin trucks and jewels, but not tuckin they truck jewels
(Evidence)
Yo, since last year I've accumulated more money
More big breaks, been dressy a little less bummy
But more headaches and more pain in my stomach
On top of that I got a lot of people actin funny
But dummies get exposed when your weapon's are chose
Power to spit out your mouth cold could leave a man fold
Yo, been to certain places where the term "green" don't mean shit
'Cause money's blue and that's what it takes to pay rent
(Chorus) 2x
(Jamaican man talking & Babu mixing)
"Everybody got dreams of making cash money"
"Everybody got dreams of making cash money"
(Evidence)
Yo, trained to be patient but still wait eagerly
Approach easily, backed by walkin Evil Dee
Sell medicine legally with my partners to our clients
(Share the wealth with Babu and Iriscience)
(Iriscience)
Navy be	, Henny be	, Beat Junkies sound
Expansion team, independent dollars, word a mouth
There's cats with twenty/twenty that'll never see money
To get the cash crop you have to plant seed money
Twelve inches spark, now accountants crunch digits
The same cat that battled them fools for lunch tickets
Everyday the rates change and currency's strange
???, international money exchange
(Chorus) 4x
Trade money, trade money, trade money
Trade money, trade money, trade money
Money exchange

Suga Free
Ay check this out Quik
Ay man this shit tripped me out one day man
My Uncle told me man right, I asked him for a dollar right?

Do they say they love you? Do they say they'll do anything for you?

Forget about the dick, get, turn a trick, then yell GERONIMO!
Suga Free, I keep it V.I.
If lovin the pimpin is wrong Pimpin, I don't wanna be right!
She said her childhood was bad - grind, tellin the pimpin
She got molested by her dad - all she want is attention
Now you want somethin else to feel though? Nigga you mean to tell me
you'd rather settle for apple instead of a peach?
Man a square bitch instead of a real hoe? Huh? What, she cool?
Yeah trick as long as you pay for that cocina you the motherfuckin fool
"Hey Suga Free man, you still the shit!" Ah yeah man
That's cause I cracks my whip a lil' bit
and fuck 'em real hard without givin 'em no dick
What the hell fo'? Like you really give a fuck about this dick
And if you did get a lil' bit you'll get lazy and let the pussy sell slow
*tchk* Oh brother, nine-one-one's mortician and the other
But fuck her, she came to pay not to stay so get another
"Oh my gosh!" "Lil' bitch." "Make the money hoe!"
"On!" "Ugly-ass bitch!" "Yes honey,

Suga Free
Here I go! Yo!
Shit they finally let the pimpin out the pen, HERE I GO!
Bitch what you mean wait? Yo
Now didn't waitin make the motherfuckin bread break?
And didn't fuckin that bitch make you predictable?
And when you woke up in the mornin, wasn't you still broke?
She loves her pimp, stays dapper for him
If she got any dreams, you want them too
Take her to the county, fill out that CH-7 form
Nigga I ain't the motherfuckin sucker
I pop my collar everytime (?) wholeness
Rippin the linin up out that motherfucker!
Bitch-ass niggaz hatin sayin, "I don't see how he do it"
That's cause they scared of the rules
Lookin for naps and no backbone to put into it
If I hang around NINE, MO', MOTHERFUCKERS, JUST, LIKE, YOU
I WOULD BE THE TENTH!
"Why don't you straighten up and get a job?"

[9th Wonder]
From the Benz to Impallas, fistful of cash
A bank account, matter of fact, quick to hand me one, blast
Instead of maxing in the winter, I'm in Japan with my kin
Hydro spraying a blunt, while Duke do the glasse
Never did comical, quick to
Change up the slangin and bring the beef to you
Just like McDonalds do

I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
I said I'll make you shake your ass like Les MaCan
And the you're out talking shit like Yosemite Sam
You've got the elephant feet like Les McCan
Up the crack of dawn I'm on my way
We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay
'Cause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand
I'm changing my middle name to first Trem
I'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite
I've got hole in my mouth where my teeth should be
You ask whatever happenened to the rappin' duke
I heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth
taking care of my functions still smokin, up the shrubery
I stopped eating chicken 'cause the shit was too rubbery
Produce organic from my own yard
Only the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard
Dreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb
Waking up my long joint, ready to get some
Looking at my board and my old boots
Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth
And on the court I've got game like my brother Matt
I give a shout out so where you at
But don't get souped Mathew 'cause I'm a take ya
Horatio Park right now and I'm a shake ya
Give me the fresh count 'cause you know that I'm stressed out
I need some inspiration so get the best out
Like Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line
Writing the fresh rhyme, having the best time
Good vibes flowing all around
Not a worry in mind as the friends around
A shout out to Linda riding pow forever
Well the Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather
Well I smoke a bag of rat weed 'cause I don't care
and I'm waking old ladies out their underwear
I like the boomin' grannies in big old panties
I'm giving, it to grandma making her crazy
I might be a white boy but I'm no goofy
Got beats like Bobalou on "I Love Lucy"
I'm not like the Skipper on "Fantasy Island"
I'm more like Captain Shtupping when I go back whylin'
The Cire Traverse out to Death shoot
or S.T.H. when they let me back at the Deuce
'Cause I can't get enough of that funky stuff
When the going gets rough ain't going out in the sluff
Down with Bubble Gum and Ninth Creation
Get down we've got the sound sensation
Kid Fresh is back from the 80's
And we're doing it for the ladies
(Chorus)

(Verse)
Gave me breath and I howled at the moon
Hear you speak in my dreams
Whisper truth
(Bridge)
Lead me to You
Please Lord
(Chorus)
No one can make me feel
The way You make me feel
I was against the world
But there aint no one else
But You and me here
Thought I was by myself
Higher self
(Verse)
I was running on fours like a fool
Now Im flying like You do
To You
(Bridge)
Lead me to You
I Need love
(Chorus x2)
No one can make me feel
The way You make me feel
I was against the world
But there aint no one else
But You and me here
Thought I was by myself
Higher self

Im so extraordinary
St. John just like Walter Berry
Pinch my gift like the LA dodgers
Hold Death fine like you need a Rodgers
Talk my slang as I flash my rangs'
Holla at dames that love my game
Blunt still lit in my new stance whip
My big n ten nig got a Hennessey fifth
I wake up like Mickey Cohen
Say hey freak then start the blowin
Wig pulled back like a matador
I might holla at a freak I never seen before, ya know
I fly out to San Diyayo
To la la land just to catch the late show
Count my bankroll with torns and halos
My cell phone rings and its time to make dough [money]
T.J. I'ma count my pesos
Lay low like Jose Conseco
Rake hoes as I deliver the facials
The peas in the pocket they rockin' the grey shit
We stay crunk man I thought we told ya
Shaggys back you aint seen the posta?
Well listen to this because this might hold ya
So we can blow cheese on coke and goja
'cause' when I'm over I spit more game than the law allows
Some trick say your boy is foul
Not only do I talk the talk I walk that walk
And when I speak this is big boss talk
'cause I am so extraordinary
Doin bad things like Halley Berry
All black attire is what I'm wearing
Posin like this just keeps em staring like
this is big boss talk
listen up baby this is big boss talk
move it rapet this is big boss talk
listen when we speak 'causez this is big boss talk

I'm 2 deep and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can`t be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
'Cause you`ll catch hell you`ll get dealt with
[Chorus]
I never sleep
I always peep
Rhymes creep
I`m 2 Deep
I`m 2 Deep....
I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife
But then again I think I`ll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I`m the holder of the key
Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean
Say what I mean and I`m out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout
[Chorus]
For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we`re all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart
Don`t let it happen
Let`s put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction
Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice
[Chorus]

Chorus
I want to thank Jesus
For the plan of salvation
Just to say Lord I love you
For you understand
I want to be there on
That great judgment morning
To touch all the nail prints
In his feet and his hands.
Verse
One morning at daybreak
A crowd slowly gathered
They were walking my Lord up
Old Cavary's hill
So sad was the scene there
The birds hushed their singing
Like a lamb he was humbled
To his father's own will.
I want to thank Jesus
For the plan of salvation
Just to say Lord I love you
For you understand
I want to be there on
That great judgment morning
To touch all the nail prints
In his feet and his hands.
I want to thank Jesus
For the plan of salvation
Just to say Lord I love you
For you understand
I want to be there on
That great judgment morning
To touch all the nail prints
In his feet and his hands.
To touch all the nail prints
In his feet and his hands.

DTP we got them guns that go
Yea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer
Niggaz recognize my name, I dub the young dealer
You better tell ya man that with the gauges I'm nice
Ill shoot up y'all white shirts until y'all look like dikes
But I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggas

DTP we ain't plying if you try to get our pen
A.K's get ta spraying like,
Bottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it
Bust you in the broad day, on the street that's fully crowded
Find our hole and fagots there, just for thinking its rap
And tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree
So you should what you saying if it's intended for me
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking
And that oozy get to talking like
Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em
Can the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em
Press him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up
Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up
A-B-C-E-F shawty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle,
And I'm throwing text like a NBA ref
I got, all gold guns like they came from Iraq
Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
And ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'ma click
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm webbing choppers like helicopters
You goin' need hella doctors, when the glok go
Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip that text be quick
20 over there, Tity over there, Luda over there, ain't no exit trick
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks
Reload with the next clip, I'm the ro nigga to flex with bitch
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click
My pistol grip sound like this, now what
Who want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust
Y'all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Y'all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
I'm wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone
So there for you should invest, in a vest for ya dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Beast the nick, but my cannon go

[Chorus]
Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change,
Made my life change,
Made my life change,
Made my life change,
Made my life change,
Yea yet yet yet I move on,
Yeah yes I move on,
Yeah yes I move on,
Yeah yes I move on, (hear me out now)
Where I'm from see us guy don't believe in luck
I can't believe what they doin' to my nigga buck
Facin' time, 25 to life
25 the same thing as life
Only chips is to fight or to forfeit
Baby momma tryin' to make the mortgage
Daughters playin', tryna put cha back up in the portrait
Uh it's like the tear never stop
When u was home it's like the smiles never drop
Collect calls with all the hopes of the best
And hang up with a knot in my chest
See see your cell is my hell
My hell is our pain
The hurt gon never stop until we see you home again
And that's all we wanna see
Maybe in a dream but not a memory
Forget that hold your head man head man
Last night what I seen made my life change
[Chorus]
I was retched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked
So much so I had left my family forsaken
A troubled soul whose heart was often achin'
So much dough but my spirit ever so vacant
Foul and fragrant I was taken off course
The road ahead should have ended me in divorce
But now I see clearly with the family of 4
Never did I deserve a 2 seater Porsche
Heart filled with remorse, my life was such a mess
Now I'm back on board due to the lords G-P-S
One eighty degree turn whoever could've guessed
Malice believe in his heart and out my mouth I confess
Yes more than blessed I was chosen
I been on the troop, my wisdom is that of old men
Wasted so much time stuntin' for folk
When really the whole time I was just stuntin' my growth
A message to the youth, what I'm offerin' is hope
Now somethings gotta change I'm at the end of my rope
Cause
[Chorus]
You know I gotta go and get it
There ain't no other choice in it
Ain't tryin' to be a part of the percentage
Hear me out now
Lord knows I done seen the worlds cold shoulder
Seein' my future thru the crystal ball of bakin' soda
Oasis of hoes, my champagne supernova
The high life and high times, I watched em turn sober
Seen it all come crashin' crashin'
The F-E-D's was at the door, and no they not askin'
Sayin' they found drugs but they ain't talkin' asprin'
Diesel design ones and I ain't talkin' fast shit
Money hoes and clothes is malice's past tense
All said forgiven, all you do is askin'
Even when laughin' I can't explain the hurt
Knowin' I can't change the world in a verse
Even to my self I'm feelin' my screws loose
But how can I deny what I know to be true
When I dint have a clue, shoulda viewed it as a gift
Now I see what they mean ignorance is bliss
[Chorus]
You know I gotta go and get it
There ain't no other choice in it
Ain't tryin' to be a part of the percentage
Hear me out now

[Repeat - x2]
Chamillitary Mane... Are you ready?
[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
A couple of clowns in the town, run around, they used to be down
But it's build, check what you speaking, watch how you're using your nouns
Can make a million from home, making moves from my lounge
Hard to play captain save her cause them dudes is usually drowned
If you gon' hate, you at least could wait til it get to the chorus
You my promotional team, them boys my biggest supporters
Reside in Houston but they pay me to make a switch like the oilers
Toured a crib like a tourist, my yard look like a forest
Time to get a Thesaurus, they at a loss for words
They can't pronounce what I'm in, they like "All them cars is yers?"
I got cars with curves, treating all my cars like birds
The fleet is a flock and the engine starts like "brrr"
Welcome to the place where the music is slowed and choppy
The writers that wrote about me
Said that I wouldn't sell and the major label was gonna drop me
I make money moves and the population is sure to copy
When I need a favour I'ma call Ben Franklin like I know you got me
[Hook]
Haters was hating, they thought that I wouldn't last
But I'm still on the grind, I can see why they mad
Cause I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash so do the math
They knocking my hustle, they saw me coming up fast
But I'm still getting mine, can't do nothing but laugh
Cause I'm still countin' my cash (uh)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash so do the math
[Verse 2]
This is for everyone who be acting like a Grammy made me a winner
My hunger did it so do me a favour and make me a dinner
Eating cakes at the lima, they gon' hate when you enter
Pockets swollen, I'm holding up monkey jeans with suspenders
None of these rappers is real, cause if you real then you dodging me
Ain't bumped into one that's even halfway as real from what I can see
I extend middle finger and don't extend an apology
Shows getting me paper, sales getting me property
Guess I'm good at monopoly, taking over the game
Trynna hold so much paper that my arms and shoulders just stain
Ain't smoking or drinking but I'm thinking what being sober will bring
You got a hangover in the morning but I'm hanging over in Spain
Fifty thousand through customs, I know you isn't accustomed
Cause money talks and your pockets look like an end of discussion
So hitting my head on the ceiling from money getting is nothing
I stand on top of my paper and probably get a concussion
I know the...
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Remember that little apartment, we was laughing at Martin
Now the Martin's the aft and the one we passing is ???
And proper tags with bargains, the card is black what I'm charging
Grind out of this world, I'm chasing ground like a Martian
A hustler that really ball, your purchase is pretty small
Your money is minimal, my crib is a mini mall
And if it ain't really large, my bidness gon' get resolved
I feel like they fake and the boys is fighting for pennies dog
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Gotta keep my hustle up
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, I'm a hustler
You know that I hustle for the
M-O-N-E
M-O-N-E
M-O-N-E
M-O-N-E
I ain't even gotta say Y (say Y baby)
She asked me why I'm missing and I (I'm out on the grind)
Cause the reason is that I'm on my grind
[Hook]

If it weren't for kids, have you ever thought
There wouldn't be a Santa Clause
Or look what the stork just brought?
Thank God for kids and we'd all live in a quiet house
Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse
Or cool aid on the couch, thank God for kids
Thank God for kids, there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why
The dearest thing to heaven is a child?
Daddy, how does this thing fly?
And a hundred other where's and whys
I really don't know but I try, thank God for kids
When I look down in those trusting eyes
That look to me I realize that's love that I can't buy
Thank God for kids
Thank God for kids, there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why
The dearest thing to heaven is a child?
So when you get down on your knees tonight
And thank Him for His guiding light
And pray they'll turn out right
Thank God for kids, ooh, thank God for kids

All my life, I've been down to ride
Till I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and being between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life
You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where the niggas load clips and fats
And get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbanin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life, you never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle
R.I.P to KMG
Still gotta murder rap, and don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building I just give a fuck where the money at
They coaching the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays and if you get a train better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta, y'all testin my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a capre
(Wait, hold up I got next)
(What up X)
Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, oh you fucks guess what, I'm ready to blow
(Yo, oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors scrapin' bumpin' in the driveway
You gave me the pistol told me to kill at will
(Blow, yo, oh no)
(I couldn't give a fuck)
Literally, cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities
(Well I don't know what you know
But I know I got that shit)
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitches niggas from runnin' their mouth
(It's bout time somebody said something)

The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ha ha, ride
All you see is the sun, reflectin' off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you
[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin']
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a "G Thang,"
And a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
[Chorus: x2]
Always die
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ha ha, ride

Killa
'For leaf big blowgun, fag nigga's bitch, doj' an'
Peach chrome, sick Rover, Zeke home so bend over
He looked at me and said "Killa I'll be your kitchen pitcher, the bing was rough"
I said nigga I did the bid wit' ya
Capiche, not Mona Lisa it's the big picture
Six scriptures, six blickers, grip triggers, strip niggaz
The Big Dipper, swig liquor, big liver
Now that you home watch the shit differ, I dig nigga
Soon as a nigga whisper, believe we jiggin' Jigga
He Elton Brand in a barber chair, he'll get the Clippers
I don't care who you are, the point, don't be stupid pa
We celebrities with guns, shooting stars
Yeah remove ya bras, a few of ours in through-in cars
Spray 21, Blackjack, I knew ya cards
Kid roll, Peter Rowe like Kennedy
Friends with me at the graveyard, visits from old enemies
Some bitched, some snitched, some owed us dough
Piss on the tombstone, write on it, "Told you so"
Check my portfolio, I was poor then rose to dough
KNow what I'm about in a drought I score, overflow
I'm the waterboy, wet work for water call
The price is nice, TLC, some waterfalls
Fiends snort it all, this fact I report to y'all
Go inside, extort them all, from short to tall you oughta ball
And where the ballas live and all my friends all to win
This the second time around, that shit you call again
Damn yo' lady fine, you been on yo' baby grind
Me I'm 86, highest temp, P-89s
Everyday we shine, fine, don't pay me mind
My watches are retarded, you can call 'em crazy times
Mines are more than brothers
We gon' rock til the Range, Benz, and Porsches clutter
Garage, assorted colors
Yeah Crayola box, for that, payola doc
I'll lay you over a stroller with the strangest odor ock
Is it over not, huh, we immune to you
We shoot the wake up, striaght up and dead the funeral
Ay yo hold the fuck up
I said we gon' shoot the wake up and dead the fu--
You dead already we gon' dead the fu--
Matter fact son, bring that shit back up, fuck it
And you heard Rell, I do worst than foul
They murdered Roberta, lawyer murdered murder trials
We deserve to style, walk on Persian tile
On the island with millions, Durst to Al
I get cake in layers, not the Daily News
But when I flip, I make the papers, hate the mayor
I'm a gangsta, I fuck ma, go date a player
Man these dudes are fish market, straight fillet ya
Went to war with Kromo, then Pataki
Then Guilliani, then I went to North Cackalacky
What you gon' tell a mobster, cake was hella proper
No Petey Pablo when I saw them helicopters
That's the letter niggaz, trinckets from the ghetto bird
Her word said I gave the whole ghetto birds
Man your case go find it, need a new assignment
That ain't giving out, first of all that's call for silent
Contest to play
You got no gunwounds, jail time, felonies, real shit on your resume
I get you extra yay, not tomorrow, yesterday
If they ask, never say, snitch and we never play, ay

Sound like my mic is right
Ugh
I am not a human
Shout to all my moon men
Daddy call me Tune
Got them b****es tuned in
It's a crazy world so I stay in mine
And n****s don't cross the line
N****s stay in line
Like welfare I stay elsewhere
Hotter than a devil, n**** hell yeah
Roc-a-bye baby, homocide baby
That's more tear drops, call me Cry Baby
What you talkin' 'bout? Tell it to my .9
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms
I'm a young god, swagga un-flawed
B**** I'm in the building, you in the front yard
Life's a b****, naw, better yet a dumb broad
And I bet I can f*** the world and make it cum hard
Yeah you boys is washed up
And I'm s***tin' on 'em, like two girls and one cup
Weezy Baby aka bring the money home
Pull out a AK and pop ya in ya funny bone
Laugh now die later muthaf***er
You's a b**** like Zeta Phi Beta muthaf***er
[Chorus]
Yeah, I call it how I see ya

Yeah we in this b****, like tampons
Dump ya in the woods, now get ya camp on
Choke hold around this s*** 'cause I'm so hands on

Back against the wall and my two feet is what I stand on
Diva in the room, she blowin' me just like a band horn
Got her on her knees the same knees that she be prayin' on
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, "You can join"
Yeah, what y'all wanna do I'm all ears
Smokin' on that head band call that s*** that Paul Pierce
I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years
Ball like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears
[Chorus]
I am, spendin' much more than I'm makin' on these cars and these vacations
Is that too much information?
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racin'
With a windshield full of tickets 'cause I live right by the station
I am, try'na figure out why you so mad at me
Yes I'm with Young Money tell the magazine stop askin' me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
And a flag the color red like a f***in' low battery
N**** peep the s*** I'm wylin' on
I be with your baby momma you be with your child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of Styrofoam
Big cheese, big bread, call that s*** a calzone
I will break yo' f***in' collar bone
Us against the world, better pick which f***in' side you on
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady puttin' mileage on
And we about to kill 'em, C4 Mr. Carter's home
Yeah, I call it how I see ya
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya
We some a**hole n****s, call us diarrhea

Who's movin in? (when can I expect my payment)
Refuse and choose to brave men (yo grave will be under this pavement)
Concrete burial, war for you, for all of you
(Win or lose, you still lose and that's the rules)
The respect I get is just a reflection of my status
(Top ranking never catch a smokin in a bandage)
About the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the dough)

Outside (postered up, a Mr. Pool in my thugs)
It's bug the ones who hold heat is the way they show love
(While the drug kingpin, showed his way to baguettes
And pressin looker birds, with his blue face Lex
Throw on his wrist like he's flamin, peer door he be slayin
Broad like iced out, Cardiar chain danglin)
I seen him minglin with the high rollers
Rollin high dollars, ballin wit more tricks than Harlem Globetrotters
Got a whole lotta soldiers to his dirty deeds for him
(Shorty's the G form) Little niggas movin keys for him
(The d's on) But couldn't touch him when they caught him
('cause he support them) wit the same money that bought him
[Chorus: Tek (Steele)]
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about big faces (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the paper (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about big faces

Aiyo sun, got a minute let me tell you about this one
This young sexy bunny, checkin money to hit somethin
I don't mean fuckin, the only cream she be likin
Is that green stuff that come and make her whole world function
Rebon Capatone, love guns and roses, expesive clothes
With diamonds and niggas that holdin, then she foldin
Rockin Panamanian gold, and ear ring,
bracelet link change with 550 clothin
[Tek]
Young bird, an iceberg, slams ago E.S.
Here's press, a platinum rolly, 5 karat necklace
Gotta pay to sex it, she catch ya wallet when you sleepin naked
Throughbread for the dough, 'cause she gotta make it
I help to take it, seven digit figure caper
So much paper, cop the Lex, already laced her
From exquisite, faithful to a thug on jail visits
Have fun on the weekend, then it's back to business
[Chorus: Steele (Tek)]
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the dough)

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was movin too fast, yaknawimsayin?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time
[Common]
Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see em
My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em
Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em
Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em
Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the you-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...
"Still gettin mine, in the" "ONE" "NINE" "NINE" "NINE"

Check it out, everyday ha yeah

Common Sense, Sadat X puttin something in your ear
Something for you to grab
For the whole world, yaknowimsayin, but it ain't free
It's a fee, check it out
You squirm wit this coughin, whippin cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'ma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the place I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm tellin you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is fellin you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
'cause I'm the dead eye, wit the red eye, from Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growin
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showin
A male seed, praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me?
The king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top 'cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...
"Still gettin mine, in the" "ONE" "NINE" "NINE" "NINE"
*sample cut and played in background 3X*
[Common]
Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder tellin me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring/Warren like a G-Child
Searchin for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the bal-cony
Lyrically I put a hit on em, 'cause I'm the style-Nitty
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Tryin to get a chick to kick it wit me till the tilt
Told her my Chamber's like Wilt
Built wit her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was givin me neck, yo I'm still gettin mine...
"Still gettin mine, in the" "ONE" "NINE" "NINE" "NINE"
*sample cut and played in background 4X*

We can jet, believe it
I know that you won't
And yes, there's a feelin'

Let us start now
It's that time
So let's travel
And see the light
(And I'm)
Gonna take you out
Anywhere you wanna go now

To the town
Where we both can party now
Drink in London
Dance in Paris
Let's chase our love
Let's chase our love
Shout real loud now
And let them hear us
Let's chase our love

Tonight, night, night, night

[Chorus: x2]
My game so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough so long, baby why prolong
Baby we get high, Baby we get dough
Baby we can party all night till death come
We been in the game for a long time
Yes we're battle tested
With the time and the emotion, and the money invested
And if you think hard
No one elses game is tighter
Check the network, up in ya fucking service provider
I bought you thug shit
Thought you drug shit
Got you bugged shit
Tell me what we haven't done
We run you through course son
Leave you understanding what the street life is
But you haters never understand
So eat my dick
You better
Get on your concentration
If you ready to roll on me
And good bitches if you want to unload on me
Cause if you miss you won't get that far
Ill have you jumping fences
And running down the treat like a track star
I'm at the finish line, its essential
We so influential
Well strip you of your street credential
Game recognize, game we all about
Think you can diminish mine
Look homey I got a career
[Chorus: x2]
They call me dog homey
Look I don't sell woof tickets
I got my fingers on the trigger
And I'm ready to click it
I never back down
there's nothing you cand do to me nigga
Who the fuck are you
Your face is really new to me nigga
You want to run with the dog
Try paying your dues homes
Bum nigga yelling every time that I use chrome
So many niggas, ain't none of them blast, the right lights
In the woods be stunning their ass
I took a chance
To advance, in my life believe it
It takes a stand to be a man
Plus the gang conceited
Fools trying to be hard
They only act the role
You little sorry ass bitches, Ill smack you hoes
Try to fool people
Make em think you something your not
I'm exposing all you bitches
By provoking the crowd
Raw dogging, dying for some action, drama
Your bitch shocked out
Bullets through plastic dome

[Chorus: x3]
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Well we enter the facility, the place is jumpin'
Everything is crowded, the music is bumpin'
We make a lap with drink in hand
Try to walk around but we're in demand
About then sweety went to the ladies room
And that's when the DJ played the boom
Boom, boom, bang-biggity-bang
I looked over my shoulder and I was like "Dang!"
A chick was dancin' on the bar so I double checked
Sweety came back, something wrong with your head?
I said,
[Chorus: x4]
Like the fellas on the beach in the summertime
Checkin' out the girls walkin' up and down the coastline
Splashin' in the surf in their bikinis
Others tan on a blanket while they sip martinis
All winter long fellas did those crunches
'Cause girls are like bananas, man, they roll in bunches
Lookin' for fun but didn't keep it in check
What happened to you boy? I got a crick in my neck!
[Chorus: x4]
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
Mmm hmm! Got a crick in my neck!
You're hanging on my words like a life preserver
My rhyme is your table and I'll be your server
Paid attention to the song like a record exec
Bobbed your head up and down and got a crick in your neck!
[Chorus: x4]

Yeah, can I taste you
You know you want me to
Let's not waste another minute
Let's not waste another minute
My love for you is burning. Your very soul is yearning. want to give your love
To me.
And baby you would like to see how a man like me could love a woman like you.
Just think of the things that we could do, babe. If you want to stay the
Night. Everything could be alright.
[Chorus]
Let's not waste another minute, babe.
I just got to get it through to you.
What I want to do.
Make love to you.
The whole night through with you.
Can't believe your by my side. Holding me close tonight. Telling me you want to
Be all mine. And asking if I had the time to give you all you want, Yea oh
Oh, I'll kiss your back and I'll lick your front. You must understand that
I'm just a man and I've been waiting here forever, Can I start wherever I
Want to.
[Chorus x 2]
We've got all night to spend.
(Yes we do, if you don't mind, baby)
If you should change your mind or if you need some time.
('Cause I know we're going to go to far)
[Chorus x 3]
You make me say yea

Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets
I got a real taste for dyin' but I ain't do it yet
I tried to watch The Artist with my girlfriend
But instead I lost the battle with some Nyquil
Playing Double Dribble with my older cousin
Now I'm ballin' everyday so dude that's gotta stand for something
But it doesn't change the subject
Man, I'm hustlin', sandals cuttin' up
My ankles, please and thank you
Demons hate you when you angel
Never been to prison, but I serve a sentence
Grind when you (?)
I'm sharin' experiments with Seventh Day Adventists
And on the seventh day, I'mma show y'all what the event is
Dollar signs, bottom line
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you
Unless it's funny
That's how I used to make money
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want something from me
Why the flow so dummy
, why do hoes still love me?
I don't know, don't bug me
I'm patron or bubbly or power,
Ain't nobody sober
My mama don't drink but she kill me over soda
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony
My cousin bang Camp man (My cousin bang Camp man)
ATLien made it myself about a month
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck
Girls be tweetin' me their pictures, man I gotta look
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook
It's not a hook
I be killin' every nigga with bronchitises

You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, with Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6

Oooo I want to be girl let me be
I want to be everythin' your man's not
And I'm gonna give you every little thing I got
'Cause you are more than a man needs
That's why I say you're truly my destiny
I'm gonna get ya If it takes until forever
No you don't feel me if forever turns into never
I'll let you know my love is just as strong
And for you never just ain't that long
I want to be the smile you put on your face
I want to be your hands when you say your grace
I want to be whatever is your favorite place, oh
I just want to be close
I want to be the hat you put on your head
I want to be the sheets you put on your bed
I want to be the skirt wrapped around your legs
Oh, I just want to be close
And even if the day turns into night
I will love you by candlelight
And even if he water starts to run over
I'll be there to put you on my shoulder
And if it's hard for you to get to sleep
I will sing you a melody,
I want to feel this way Till the end of time,
'Cause I pray one day That you will be mine
I want to be the smile you put on your face
I want to be your hands when you say your grace
I want to be whatever is your favorite place, oh
I just want to be close
I want to be the hat you put on your head
I want to be the sheets you put on your bed
I want to be the skirt wrapped around your legs
Oh, I just want to be close
See my life is filled with up and downs
And I'm okay when you're around
And when I'm in a storm my nights are cold
Reach out your hands for me to hold
See you're my queen on a throne
And you're the reason For a song
And I can't wait to fill you up with love
Fill you with love
I want to be your sun, your stars, and your moon
I want to be your hot summer day in June
I want to be the smell of your sweet perfume
I just want to be close
I want to be the seed That bare your life brand new
I want to be the one that's so faithful and true
I want to be the man down that aisle in that suit, yes
I just want to be close

Let's take it to Yonkers, Blok Party
Yeah, what? New DMX
Niggaz is scared to fuck with the Dog 'cause I'm shady
You remember that kid from runnin'
Up an' down from Buildin' 80?
Highs are extreme, lows are suicidal
Got me reachin' for the Bible 'cause I think I'm genocidal
Fakers think I'm bluffin' but I'm not
Say that I be buggin' 'cause I be makin' it hot
Knowin' all I got is my, nuts an' my word
Though I'm never seen, the Dark is always heard
I speak for those who speak with glocks
From frequent blocks, where the objective
Is to put in twelve, stay alive an' leave in knots
From little rocks bein' sold, then motherfucker
If you live to see 40, then you old
An' me bein' the way I am, if the Devil close to me
That's the reason why I'm never I'm supposed to be
I chose to be on some Dark shit
Rip apart shit an' start shit, until whenever I depart, bitch
The hard shit will leave yo' ass stretched laid the fuck out
I'm on the edge, life is played out, I made out
Kinda good with the last couple of runs
Up the coast with it, couple of keys, couple of guns
The funds wasn't the issue, it was other shit
That had me flippin' on my brother's shit
Stealin' from my mother's shit
Cry by myself, I couldn't hide form myself
An' if I push my wig back, then I die by myself
'Cause it gets
Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'
Deeper an' deeper
These souls from underground keep callin'
Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'
Deeper an' deeper
These souls from underground keep callin'
Why is it that I do what I do?
Why is it that, only to these streets can I be true?
I ain't never been shit, my peoples been told me so
Hold me, yo, niggaz don't, know me, yo
'Cause they ain't out that mob that's out to get niggaz
Rip niggaz, split niggaz when you hit niggaz
Long as there's bodies to be caught
There's shotties to be bought
Hired that transport, fake Gotti's to extort
I cry for help but niggaz don't hear me
Niggaz don't understand me, that's why niggaz fear me
Hit the old neighborhood 'cause I'm 'bout to end it
Stressin' shit that I went through an' what I been did
Niggaz, I offended, will have to take it as a loss
'Cause in a minute, what I'm thinkin'
Is about to look like sauce, gots to pay the cost
An' this time it's gon' cost you my life
My love to my children an' my wife
Step to the last, would I, could I, should I?
Really understand with, seein with my good eye
The hood, I, came up in showed no mercy
Unforgiven of the many plagues that cursed me
The worst we went through would make a, grown man fumble
Learnin' to walk an' it hurts when you stumble
Figure out the jumble an' you live, if not you die
On my knees, hands up to the sky, why?
Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'
Deeper an' deeper
These souls from underground keep callin'
Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'
Deeper an' deeper
These souls from underground keep callin'
Yeah, what you know about two 24 verses?
DMX, hehe, fat shout whole Bloodline
Jazz, DMX, Uncle Ray

Own It
It's yours
Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is?
It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love
Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend
Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
It's yours
Own it

Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Go own that shit
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline
You should call it
When the last time you did something for the first time?
You have done it all, swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours
Own it
It's yours, yeah
It's yours, own it
Own It
Own It
Own It
Own It
Baby, own it
It's yours
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit

And it is with the dogs with their rifles, thousands of them line the pavement, like patients pupae waiting to become worms
(I feel good as new, good as new, good as new, good as new....)
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking
[Aesop]
Another dark night, teethin the market of B-sheep, like I'm walking around the 39 thieves in a beat spores of a warm Helvetica brown proper for the odd gutter monster propped on the teleprompter, wild blue yonder blue in the face angel blew into the bugle in lieu of the euthanasia, usually the shooter community chew the corpse but I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours, day of the dead play the ledge closely train the barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey, dope, the gonzo have always felt choked socially, stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies earth lies divided by fighting tribes all we do is watch em waddle back and forth lighting fires (money money) detonator wire cutters pliers two cities and one is broken up in tiny tiles and I walk, pose, harmin the heart of the lion's throat for a photographic children of my primordial growth, you parade around a kill so damn proud like a flat-line fetish had his feathers fanned out, war totem symmetry, skip into it gingerly, silk worms ping pong minister to ministry, hells bells every which way the winds blows, so I bang my head against any wall you can build, go
[El-P]
another dark night, another not alright, another bad ritual, war-bot surgery, better follow the bread-crumbs back, in fact, urgently, there's water through the session where the natives feel murder-y, vicinity wandered claim no zone never let an anchor drop never had a home never talk to strangers never trust a friend, this is the life and the life will not end
(Money money money money money money...)
(Good as new, good as new, good as new, good as new...)
[Aesop]
Next time think, 39 thieves, quicker than 40 winks, raise your drinks, 39 thieves, quicker than 40 winks
Why are you consumed with the community aloofness, dude we're animals we'll just go where the most food is, lower the toast most former letter-kid is useless, truth is you're equally expendable as spoon-fed, (money money), money is cool I'm only human but they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded, like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is, bullets don't talk bribes stupid, they shoot shit
[Aesop]
Another dark night, down it goes, tread around the rabbit hole, weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grow, piss warm suger water where the summer canteen plus burn rubber like green is the new green, rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex, rodeo commotion I'm open to see what culminates, bourgie on the right, left rep rebel force, both say the futile "prove the parking lot was never yours," black top pebble bores, soldiers molded when the joneses every grown-up in Dakota came to groping, no motives they showed em the gross quotas, hog barn burner come see if your home told us, 85 rattle trap park the fancy, he could swear he was steppin outta Comanche, antsy, let us in he jettison the medicine and paranormal hatchery condense and break the levees in (money money), we both know the totem camaraderie, tokin' up equality, they posted horizontally, pride of golden load the doctor brought a lobster colony, half-mass slags have caps through em properly, and sleep the sleep of the just, ready on the left when the witchcraft spun it with a neighboring sect, with the usual undesirables and the Big Brother cutters, on the day your name became "This motherfucker?!"
[El-P]
another dark night, another not alright, another bad ritual, war-bot surgery, better follow the bread-crumbs back, in fact, urgently, there's water through the session where the natives feel murder-y, vicinity wanders claim no zone never let an anchor drop never had a home never talk to strangers never trust a friend, this is the life and the life will not end
This is the life, this is the life, this is the life

Somedayz I feel pain, Somedayz I like rain, Somedayz I hate fame, when a deal come around and the checks don't bounce, i'm scared Someday i might change.
Someday you might tease, Somedayz I won't see, Somedayz you throw keys, to the house that I bought, cause I thought it'd make you happy, Someday you might leave.
Somedayz I'm a healer, Somedayz I'm a dealer, Somedayz I'm a killer, White woman lock her doors when I pass by, Damn, Somedayz i'm a nigga.
Somedayz you my homie, Somedayz you seem phony, Somedayz you don't know me, claim you down for the cause and you ride for ya dogs, Somedayz you don't show.
Somedayz i'm broke, Somedayz I have hope, Somedayz I can't cope, When the stress come around, I pour up some brown, Somedayz it's just smoke.
Somedayz I ain't safe, Somedayz I'm gonna pay, Somedayz I just pray, Will I go to heaven or hell, only god knows, Somedayz I can't say.
Somedayz I might lie, Somedayz I don't try, Somedayz I might cry, When I'm on my sick bed and my dayz drawin short, Damn, Someday I'm gonna die.... Somedayz...

My niggas, this is for my dogs, this is for my dogs

My dogs, the beginning of this bloodline of mine
That spark, that's in a niggas heart, that cause him to shine
Before the rhyme lessons that I keep in my mind
I owe you and I give my right hand to show you
Whether it's fist or guns whatever it go to
Its me they go through, if ever they want to
I'd line the flame, dead game and trying to scratch
K-A-S I know where my dogs is at
And I'mma be the one behind just to keep you on your toes
I be your extra eyes and hold you down around your foes
I be your extra gun, you need me let me know
For my dogs I be the first to cock it back and let it go
They do it for the dough me I do it for the love
You my nigga to the death so I treat you like my blood
If push comes to shove and they try to send you back to the street
I give my last to put you back on your feet, feel me
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs

Shit, bust a 5-4, see the judge and lie for
You the type of nigga I throw weight up on the block for
Just go ahead and lock jaws and your half I got yours
Send in the dog I smell it all night
I told niggas to shut up and write, X barks with a hell of a bite
For the love they always will be till they kill me
I put my thugs on it and slide till I die on it
And to my motherfucking dogs big ups to your first share
Niggas know the deal just waiting for them plaques to get shipped
Do your thing nigga you know we got your back
'Cause real dogs always return with food for the pack
Why these wack niggas swinging when they gon' miss
Take it from me he was nice before all this
Yo X rain on em cause after that comes the blood
Ruff Ryders, feed all they dogs wit raw blood
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs

This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, my niggas
My people show love (What!) and haven't left me stranded yet
Though I have a death wish that ain't been granted yet
So until then I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (Come on!)
Until the Lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless my body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it, wasn't going for it
Well a nigga had to give it to me, then I saw it
This is clear as day I know here's the day
I'mma be on my way nothing more to say
But take me Lord, make me Lord what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill
Been downhill from then on, 'cause I been on
Some shit hit on every move to get ten on
The next sac, but you know that's how X act
That's why these street niggas is waiting for the next track
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, my niggas
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, my niggas
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, my niggas

[Biz Markie singing]
My name is the Biz, everywhere I go
I rock the party, from head to toe
Lot of MC's wanna hear the way that I do rock
Is it because I put the party people into shock
I think it's because I am the original B
Ain't no other MC like the B-I-Z Markie (hit it Kev)
On the guitar is my man Monty
And Tex don't know how to dance for S-H-I-T (fuck you)
But everytime you hear me I am on the go
Right there in Germany is my man "Das Bo"{?}
Everytime you hear me rhyme, I know {?} how to sing
That's why a lot of girls cling to the ding-a-ling
{*everyone breaks down in laughter*}

Aye baby
I don't like the way you got me feelin' lately,
Oh
They say baby
I'm feelin' like you found someone to replace me,
Oh
Do you remember you used to say that you would never walk away
'Cause I remember the time and a place like it was just yesterday oh
Baby had me (gone gone gone)
But you won't have me (I'm gone gone gone)
Say no more 'cause I know what you came for, just wanna play them games girl
It's so hard, to be let down (Let down baby)
Tell me you won't do this to me
We've come so far (So far baby)
To give up now (To give up now)

But you ain't that crazy about me
'Cause you think that you can get whatever you want
So you lie and you try to play me say lady,
You're cold, you're poison to me
And I know
Do you remember you used to say, that you would never walk away
'Cause I remember the time and a place like it was just yesterday
Baby had me (Gone gone gone)
But you won't have me (I'm gone gone gone)
Say no more 'cause I know what you came for, just wanna play them games girl
It's so, to be let down (Let down baby)

Hey baby please don't take my love away
Tell the DJ keep this party rockin' hooray hooray

It's been a long time since we last hit the sheets
Fucked like dogs and sweated from the body heat
I was movin' my ass slowly and you told me to hold you
And like a folder, you told me to fold you
To the position where I get it from the backside
Open your legs wide and let me get inside
Caressin' your body and you're scratching my back up
I'm strokin' and yo pussy chokin' so I just slack up
Stroke it like a real one, I grab ya side
Ya tellin' me how it feels so good as my dick slips and slides
In and out ya pussy as you tell me you're cummin'
The way my dick rocked that ass I swear I was drummin'
Here I cum, dumb ditty dumb, I gotta nut so
Can't hold it no longer so I let it flow
Oh damn, oh, you on the pill, you told me to chill
I didn't wear a rubber 'cuz I like the real feel
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel
I like a pussy to be wet, steamin' hot when I get inside
I bet it's sweat but yet, still, I don't like a dead fuck
Talking 'bout makin' love, can't even get my head sucked
Fuck that, I'm on the other tip
Bitch, come my way and get dick whipped
I like bitches, bitches let me break it down
Some ho's wanna fake it, don't even make a sound
You see, I cum like the ocean and stroke like a breeze
The friction from my stroke made it 100 degrees
In the room, I ride that ass like a broom
This is another fuck song, this ain't a dance tune
I made it like this 'cuz I'm not your love maker
I'm a back breaker, it take a strong pussy to take a
Dick like this but you would love the pain
You would love the strain, get tired and change
But I'm a contain my nut until your ready to deal
'Cuz I'm a chill and I like the real feel
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel
Let's pretend, we're married and carry on like fool's
I'll break your pussy like a high school rule
We're fuckin' and suckin', I'm strokin' and hopin'
You'll have the strength to keep your legs open
No doubt, you do so I put you in the buck
Your pussy lips suck every time we fuck
Your cummin' like water and drippin' from slippin'
My dick is the belt and ya get an ass whippin'
You love me so you take the pain but it hurts so good
Flip you on yo stomach and fuck you like a man should
Call you my baby 'cuz you fuckin' me crazy
My dick gets hard if you look at me or graze me
I'm so in love with fucking you, everyday that's what we do
[Unverified] me and you F U C K I N G
I ain't tryin' to hurt your feelings 'cuz you know the deal
I like you but I love the feel
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel, it's just gotta be real
The feel

If you could see what I once was
If you could go with me
Back to where I started from
Then I know you would see
A miracle of love that took me in it's sweet embrace
And made me what I am today
Just an old sinner saved by grace.
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom with each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
How could I boast of anything I've ever seen or done?
How could I dare to claim as mine the victories God has won?
Where would I be had God not brought me gently to this place?
I'm here to say I'm nothing but a sinner saved by grace
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom with each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace

He said "we could go hit the Peapods"

Pounds from my brothers, 'cause they knowing that this is
The place to be to let it all out
But when the weekend come, the weekend come

Jumping music, swift d.j.'s
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend 'cause, here I come
Because weekends were, were
Walk in the club at like 10 o' clock
And the spot is hot, blowing up rooftops
It's Thursday night and the night is young
Four day weekend, time to have some fun

Everybody's been waiting to dance and make noise
B-boys, let me see you break it down
And ladies, let your hips move around

Got a poet named Life and a sister Kimy (worrrrd up)
And the blood of Abraham (worrrrd up)
So let's get ready for the jam
[Chorus]

And the bass was thumpin' and people was jumpin'
And Taboo's at the front door comin'

And
Nah, nah, nah
Yo, Mister Will.I.Am (Mister Will.I.Am)

Once upon John thinking on this
MC's just don't know
That the best will never contest my flow
Hieroglyphics the fly bros rip shit for ya
And watch you stumble as I kicks it
I blow ya, away
Like a sailboat, you fail quote some of my shit
to try and get props
But no, they got butt flow
What bro
Can handle the pressure from my gut blow
I appear as a foundation, laced in your face
That there will be no replacin
So trace your tracks or face the mack
'cause I got your girlfriend and ain't no takin her back
Word
I got it like that, so if you strike back
Steal, or don't say shit
I play with brains
Your thought train is often hijacked and rearranged
We became the fly macks
It's like that, 'cause we got it like that (8X)
What a little way to express the anger
Ya done pressed the stranger, danger
Might change a wrong to right
Yet a song I write will shed new light as you fight
And fuss with us so we must discuss
Busting your brain right open
And you strain I'm hoping
Enquiring minds turn out dope men, but the potion
Was not potent enough to fade the master yet
Since you have no kryptonite, I get to rip the mic
I flip like side be	, hit a comp wield and tear apart
we'll be-havin babboon
They'll be cravin the tunes
Sooner than the Sun Times on a new day
But who they, I got a bobby pin, so I can rob you men
And be driver, of how I come, with my gum
slander, and demand a man to think
'cause I can stop and wait, while others contemplate
the theories and when they hear these the fear beez
tremendous, but I won't amend this, endless
time is spent to rhyme, when I'm lit
Get a creative urge, then I sit
And muster clusters of creation we placed in
your face when I bust you
It's like that, 'cause we got it like that (16X)

[Verse 1]
You know the happenings, homies just yapping and
Hand shaking, laughing, and exchanging all they math again
You usually lose touch when you traveling
A few dudes bruise up in the batteling
Parked on Madison across from the Radison
We talked about the taddling some niggaz did in Maryland
Plus discussed, no homicides unraveling
I asked was he dabbling he laughed and said he managing
His Cardi frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Operas mouth
In other words, I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird fore I'm up and out
Without a sound, snatch my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound and told him, "Homie, hold it down"
[Chorus]
You know the game insane in the brain
Big thangs in the Range, real niggaz never change
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
So thru the fame, thru the fire and the flames
I adapt to the pain, real niggaz do the same
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
[Verse 2]
It was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him
Woke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be dogging for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep calling
Up in Nostrum's for a fresh pair of the Force 'em
Of course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport 'em
Caught 'em, before the salesmens even had time to assort 'em
Bought 'em, before any celeb stylist eva saw 'em
Warm soon as I copped 'em in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination, lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rocking, I anwsered, "What's poppin'?"
They anwsered and said, "They shot him, now the hood got a problem"
I had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle
Tryin to figure what nigga, why and by who, then
Before you know it, the other voice told it
It was homie from the old click I just seemed to spoke with
Oh shit, this can't be serious, that's my word, pssssh
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
It's Doe or Die, we survive till we slain
And it's no surprise, homie was prolly high when they came
I know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name
Godly trained, he could camoflague on any terrain
Cardi frames, we go back like bottles and James
It's a shame 'cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchalantly I refrained 'cause it constantly changed
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why didn't they go for the chain?
If they just wanted some news they coulda left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged
[Chorus] - 3X

Rip out ya skeleton I'm somethin like Davidian I'll catch you while ya sleepin put a hook through ya jugular then climb out your window I'm the scarecrow muderer
[Chorus]
Rip out ya skeleton burn the flesh I'm somethin like Davidian David Koresh I'll catch you while ya sleepin put a hook through ya jugular then climb out your window I'm the scarecrow muderer
[Verse 1]
Bury my corpse and turn it upside down so I don't claw through my coffin crawlin up out the ground cause you don't wanna see a pissed off blood suckin motha fucker rabies infested just like a rat from the gutter. Frothy at the mouth teeth sharper than a needle one function in my cranium is go and kill people and I'm good at what I do really ask any body the dead don't talk but you can see how many bodies go missin and I'm wishin I could catch you all alone sink my fangs in ya veins leave ya drained to the bone like a human juice box with straw in ya eye socket cut ya tongue out and put that bitch in my pocket.
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Semen from a demon and the heart of a gypsy mixed them both together when the wicth is feelin tipsy add a little liqour little X a little blow and what do ya get next the mother fuckin scarecrow always ready for the murder all about a homicide seen crawlin out the window on the day ya momma died and on the day ya momma cried when she found you in bed with ya throat slit skull spilt decapitated head blood drippin form the ceilin and the words on ya door read ya better run and hide because I'm comin for ya whore I'm the sickest of the sickest and I got a little sickness never leave em breathen never leave a fuckin witness.
[Chorus X2]
[Verse 3]
I'll leave a hole in ya brain like you was Kurt Cobain I'll make it rain out ya vein but no my name ain't Wayne ya feel the pain when ya strain choked out with a chain and I don't do it for the fame these blood stains ain't a game rip your spine up out the skin and go to tell your next kin kill them one by one with grin and do it all a fuckin gain I'm gone like the wind when I open your gut every incision with percision lovin every single cut and I'm bathin your ya blood til I'm the color a red take the crayola out ya artery and color you dead.
[Chorus X2]

Aiyyo what's goin on it's Ahmad on the microphone
Bout to tell y'all about the Palladium
Me and my boys, the Joneses crew in the house
Kick it
[Ahmad]
Yo it's the end of the day and it's Friday (hey)
Ahmad how bout a show to the stadium (what) you know what the Palladium
(It's cool) We can't get faded, oh that's right you don't drink
but there's a better incentive, it won't cost, you know the hoe swing
Well I said guess I guess
It's better to flex than be at home watchin "Chips"
I'd rather watch chicks
I flipped, looked to the right of me, tons of honies
One was a Playboy bunny, but I left her
Hugh Hefner's no joke, he's too heavy for my kind
I play blind and went out lookin for my type
That's right, my type, a cute fine girl named Sabrina
Coolin at the bar with her friend Tina
Way I was dressed, they thought I was ballin like Bobby Bonilla
Bought a pina colada and got another
Reached in my pants pocket, (??) riches (?) on paper
Saw a cutie 'cross the room, went on another caper
I approached her, she started havin fits
It was the pits - cause this chick thought she was the shit
My homey Kay said let's go
Ahmad ain't even fadin it y'all, cause it's cool at the Palladium
[Chorus]
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 3X}
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium.. word
[Ahmad]
Yo it's Friday the Palladium (whattup) what a great show
Kids chillin like nerds couldn't get in so they sittin on curbs
Cars rollin by deep, you couldn't miss 'em
Tempers start stowin so brothers start throwin fists at fights
I seen night lights hit skulls and glove boxers
Rock stars in limos stretch, smokin cess
I walk in and see brothers and broads causin havoc
Havoc and mayhem both straight from the West coast
Most of the dancers are housers
Some a few freaks freakin, guys playin to get laid this weekend
Speak of the devil, better put in my bid
But first get rid of this chick, she's on my testicles
Cause Ahmad is the God, I don't test no hoes
I just maintained and step in the vestibule
Be reminiscent of disses
I'm throwin body blows to weak rappers and tossin 'em to the fishes
Then callin Mrs., Bla Bla Blah
Mrs. So-and-So, your kid was blowin smoke so I choked him
Uhh, I'm just givin my respects, leave my condolences
Like when I'm bowlin, I'm bowlin strikes, I never miss
yikes - I gotta go cause they flowin I think it's my day
So chill and let's groove at the Palladium Friday
[Chorus]
[Ahmad]
Kick it yo I'm still cool at the Palladium show
Yellin out yo's with my bros and steady clockin the hoes
But now it's two o'clock I'm ready to split
Ready to get in my Chevy to get home and start hittin it hard w/ Betty
Smith or Johnson, fuck it it don't matter
Just want to climb inside a bladder like a ladder cut the chit chatter
Cause I'm smooth, never obnoxious, chillin
That's why ya never live to hear me rushin while I'm bustin
Got honies if you got dividends or in a Benz, and I got both
So now you see me, taggin asses like graffiti
And on the next day I'll be rested, exhausted
Because I was naughty, but damn, that was a hell of a party
[Chorus]
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 11X}
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium.. word
[Ahmad]
That's Ahmad and the Joneses
We on this mic, for the nineties
We out, peace

lick my balls with lots of sylivia
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
tis the season to suck a drunk driver
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
out of stye with ganster appearal
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
stroll through the hood with a loaded double-barrel
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
blazin blunts in a beat-up taurus
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
baby gansters sellin dope for us
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
digital scale to weigh and measure
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
gettin over on the system brings me pleasure
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
high as hell with dark sunglasses
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
flunking all my stupid ass classes
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
me and my homies kick it together
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
drunk and high in real cold weather
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin' with the limericks and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really wrong
At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
That I am well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention
I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MC's are problematic
I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we here we come
Like dumb ditty dumb
I keep all five boroughs in stitches
The sound sounds sweeter through the echo plex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects
Read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody lets show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move
We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower
Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate
And let's try to negotiate
And let's try to negotiate

From the C-O to across the seas
I'm guaranteed to everybody bounce with me
Been known to put it down anyplace I be
You can copy but it's only goin' be one me
I don't ride in no cars till a man come wit me
14 and i started up a whole epidemic
Look, y'all know what I'm talking about
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south
TV shows, magazine covers
Girls in groups saying, "We go with each other."
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake
What you know about selling tres mil out the gate?
I'm the hottest thing around
Neck full of bling, bling like the Neptune sound
I got it locked on the left, right, front and rear
When I step up in the spot this is all I hear
I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
Right now, when I'm old, where I'm gonna be
How I flow, homie you can bet the house on me
I'ma forever be up under the scope
I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges off Different Strokes
I was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time
Like the number 2-3 in the red and black
Mr. 106 & Park is back, holla!
I do it like no other
And attract mo' family than Ringling Brothers
I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like hash browns
See I'm the best just ask around
I'm here now, and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can
You better off gettin' a shirt, makin' a sign that reads
"Shad Moss, I'm yo number 1 fan!"
I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home

And their whole life savings I get paid for a show

Pussy niggas need to stop hating my flow sick like cancer patients

No key, that space age, my ignition, I done made it
Juicy J, that's trippy ho, Taylor Gang that's trippy ho
Smoking on that Christmas tree my belt buckle like mistletoe
Who stands with your wife?
She just spent the night
With my dick in her mouth & my balls in her hand

"That's Rakka-Iriscience, Evidence, Babu"
[Iriscience]
It's no retreat, hit the street, get my plane confirmation
To the other side of the world, a daily operation
First stop in Vegas, can't keep these lions locked in cages
We rock in places where alcohol's for all ages
On stages, in great heights land in London at night
LAX today, MP tight
A 2000 Technique cha, cut and freak
Detonate our drums, heat the plastique
[Evidence]
Ayo funky, straight up with the force to keep fighting
Samson, Atlas, Collossus, Titan
In the dark night the torch that enlightens
Our strong cast-iron, harder the lion
A mighty foundation, many mouths to feed
With the energy needed to turn a seed to weed
We're fortified tight, sturdy sound construction
Make rappers "Duck Down" like I'm Boogie Down Productions
[Iriscience]
Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat
"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat" (Repeat 2x)
[Evidence]
Yo we serve a full spectrum of flavors that's robust
Hustle in the same industry I don't trust
I know California dig it like a gold rush
And worldwide no retreat, we cold crush
Beef up support, insulate your stage or pay
Make way for the prophets of rage
While they engage to let you know we're in a new age
Babu will make a DJ turn a new page
[Iriscience]
Cause that's a dangerous man that can speak with his hands
Watered-down lyrics on dirty tracks turned to sand
To sink in, better watch the X that you ink in
Or on, disrespect us, step on my lawn
Skip the death threats, MC or graph and test these wrong
Your letters are wack, they get blown like mailbombs
I'm on the next train to your thought that's caught
Where I'm going, no retreat, hit the beat, exit the plot
[Evidence]
Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat
"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat" (Repeat 2x)
[Iriscience]
Uh, no retreat, get right up back out
Cuff the mic that's wack, develop tools to tap out
No doubt, Dilated's turning pros to flows
(No retreat) I risk my life on flights for hype shows
[Evidence]
And now you rocking with the camp that rocked last at Tramps
Worldwide, collecting little passport stamps
From the body to the mind like I'm Jesse Ventura
This millennium and mark 2000 like Futura
[Iriscience]
Bet, rest assured vaccines ain't far from cures
PLant some new shit, hit me two weeks into tour
But I'll adapt, guaranteed make it through
Eveidence, Iriscience, and my man Babu
[Evidence]
We freak by the KNK crazily
Pro game, expansion team, major league
Rakka-Iriscience trained to go the length
I'm an all-terrain think tank at full strength

Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

Roll 'em up and I smoke 'em
Tried to break, so I broke 'em
Busted his ass in the head, that's when I grabbed him and choked him
I'm on revenge, a psychopath, the master of wreckin' shit
Comes back with a body blow, hittin' hard as a fuckin' brick
Don't fuck with the mastermind, I'ma tell you like that
Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll still you with a bumper jack
Better yet grab a bat, apart from the pack
Then commence to beat on your head to the muthafuckin' fact
I'm ragin' like Manson, I'm a muthafuckin' thriller
Friday 13th's my birthday, so I was a born killer
Brought up as a trouble kid, devious shit's what I shoulda did
Mom had an abortion with me, but a nigga lived
I don't fear losin' life, 'cause life just lost me
Shadow of death keeps followin' me and I can't get him off me
Two years of my life were spent in a mental health
I'm a threat to society, then again to my fuckin' self
I'm losin' my fuckin' mind, my veins begin swellin'
"Kill that muthafucka!" I hear voices in my head yellin'
Me get caught in a cross, that's absurd
Your head is a tennis ball and I'm about to serve

Mack 10, twelve gauge, Tec-9 plus a Street Sweeper
Nigga, Ganksta NIP's in the house
Time I see a mouse automatic spaghetti sauce
Been poor all my life, so I reach for the sky
I regret I was born, I can't wait 'till I die
And leave blood on the curtain
Fatal thoughts of death, suicide is certain
I kill for a quarter, lyrics deep as the water
Peace to Rodney King, I got they ass in slaughter
Insane is what I am
I'm like Silence of the muthafuckin' Lambs
Ganksta NIP ain't no bragger-boaster
Migraine headaches made me sleep in a toaster
Step in my face, I'll commence the hittin'

Well, first of all..
I shock 'em and clock 'em and pop 'em and drop 'em, flop 'em, then I mop 'em
In they muthafuckin' tracks is where I stop 'em
Unless you down with a bloody nose
Save the cussin' and fussin' and pointin' fingers for them hoes
Talk is cheap, I catch your ass on the sneak
And hit you everywhere but under your feet
Think it's a game when it ain't
I'm lettin' you talk, but bitch, I'll knock yo lips off
And get ready for your kinfolk
Your little sister be the first one to get smoked
Then I grab your grandma by her weave hair
And whip her old ass with that wooden leg she wear
I'm from the bloody 5th and that's it, trick bitch
You don't know who you're fuckin' with
I break this ten and a half so deep in your ass
That you'll be lookin like a faggot on the rag
I'm goin for bam like Scarface and NIP
What they leave of your ass Willie D gonna rip

Time to be accounted for the all-words spunk
Counterfeit gangstas, pranksters and chumps
Talkin' real loud in front of a crowd, dare ya
I show your punk ass, nigga, better than I can tell ya
Signin' checks that your punk ass can't cash
Got your album cover full of punks wearin' ski masks
Who ain't never felt froggish, you won't leap
Barkin' like a bear and bitin' like a flea
Busters, straight suckers, muthafuckas
Donald Goines-readin'-ass want to be hustlers
It's Seag from Oakland, the one who lays order
Quit lyin' to kick it and make a run for the border
Willie D, Bushwick, Scarface and Ganksta NIP
Gave me the tip on the niggas yappin' lip
Too Black hooked me, Lil' Jay booked me
Shakin 'em, breakin 'em, makin and takin 'em fakin' fuckin' rookies
And all that loud shit, nigga, don't start
They'll find your ass chopped and stuffed in a shopping cart
Fools awake and give praise to the dark lord
Bring on the chalice, voodoo dolls and the oujia boards

[Featuring Redman]
Chorus: Parrish Smith (from 'So What Cha Sayin')
Brothers on my jock for the way I hold a piece of steel (4x)
So what cha saying
Verse One: Redman
I go wild as I sip from a cold Lowenbrau
Set up rhymes like fire to gunpowder
Boom did the bassline crank
From being rated are from being top rank
I'm hard like an erection
Phrases might get too tough to break down in sections
So I grab a pen and pad, I'm back
to make a killer, similar to a backstab
Don't arrest me, arrest my brain, it's insane
If I'm booty, then I've been framed
By an MC, who can't be the are-E-D
Fuck wit me, you'll get slapped up and capped up easy
By me and a tre-eight pistol, so vacate the premises
Or ask for Mayday, Mayday
For H-E-L-P, brothers tell me
I'm electrifyin, similar to round three
I don't brag and boast but smash and roast
MC's wit degrees from here to the West Coast
I'm miracle wit no abrakadaba
Piece of membranes will smash like crackers
Were they Ritz, Saltine, or Town House
None of the above get caught wit the roundhouse
Kick, blackflip, semifull
My vocal chord prove my pull ain't bull
I'm down wit the Squad, no more than four to five brothers
Six or more, you seen got smothered
By a fist of fury, next is the verdict
Let's hear it from the jury
Chorus
Verse Two: PMD
I'm a nightmare to rappers, terror to an MC
Cold wreck the nigga wit the help of E-D
Aggravation, don't need it, so get off my dick
Master of disaster, no time for flicks
Straight up be	-boy, Real McCoy like Bruce Leroy
Strap the bozack when I'm stabbin a skeezoid
Gangsta rap, it's Daddy Mack wit a bozack
Roy the funk punk pumps skunk like a smokestack
So swing low and lick up balls
I'm like Scharzenegger, correcting shit in Total Re-
call up E-D and the posse that's ten deep
To wax a sucker nigga booty rappin MC
So step off cause you gets no props
So stick the fork in him, Redman (why) cause he's done
Chorus
Verse Three: Erick Sermon
I'm E-D, I belong wit the A-Team
A one man wreckin machine, by all means
Necessary, I destroyed on contact
No fear, of getting killed cause I'm strapped
The Hit Squad's deep, making it sweet
to creep, on my crew so you don't sleep
My mic is caffeine, similar to Maxwell
Making it smooth for me, yes, to wax well
And you might get scared and spark a stove
Cause I pack steel but Hold On like En Vogue
My swiftness, I got a gift not for Christmas
God bless, mmm-hmm, can I get a witness
I'm fresh like a bag of Chips Ahoy
No toy, I'm a hardcore be	-boy
Once again, I quote, I'm danger
I smoked Smokey the Bear and killed the forest ranger
Poof, the fire's out and I'm gone
Peace to Mandela and Farrakhan
Chorus

Record mode! (Record mode!)
Get your money in the air like this (yeah, yeah)
Fab time, BK
[Fabolous]
From nothin' to somehin', homey (yes)
Street fit it, it, it in (yes)
Hey, it's a new year, and I'm back for new money
Just I think I left somethin' (Just Blaze!)
[Swizz Beatz]
Cash rules everything around me, cream
It's a new year, dolla dolla bill, y'all, yup
Get that money, yup
Dolla dolla bill y'all, yup
Get that money, yup
Dolla dolla bill, yup, yup
[Fabolous]
Yes, it's the return of the young hustle
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle
Me - I'd rather do my lip lashin' when the chips cash in
Then you might see me on the strip flashin'
Like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight
So shit, gettin' hit, and my leg is light
I mean it could a been a 2Pac Vegas night
Or maybe a Notorious L.A. evening
"Baby, you okay?" I mean, well, I'm breathin'
Hell, I'm even bossin' and I laugh
The money ain't right, then I toss you to the left
Yes, to the left, to the left
Everything is hustle to the death for the F
A-B, baby, they be lazy
Gucci straight jacket 'cause I may be crazy
Loony for the loot, psycho for the paper
This a new year, but I recycle for the paper
If green talks, then I'm the Geico with the paper
So have my check right, no typos with the paper, please
[Swizz Beatz]
Cash rules everything around me, cream
It's a new year, dolla dolla bill, y'all, yup
Get that money, yup
Dolla dolla bill y'all, yup
Get that money, yup
Dolla dolla bill, yup, yup
I said
Cash rules everything around me, cream
It's a new year, dolla dolla bill, y'all, yup
Get that money, yup
Dolla dolla bill y'all, yup
Get that money, yup
Dolla dolla bill, yup, yup
[Fabolous]
They say the rap game remind 'em of the crack game
That's why they money go quicker than a crack high
My money stacked high; how high? Shaq high
Yao high; that's why yours is Bow Wow high
You lookin' at your new hustle like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell in my past hustle
Shorty work it; she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap; she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin', can't turn my back to the money
And, truthfully, you're cool, but I'm attracted to money
So why don't cha turn your back to the money, and let it shake?
I'm lovin' how you move that smooth; you let it snake
But players don't chase at it, baby, we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm nine-fifteen, that means I'm hella straight
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks
I'm back for my money; it's just they luck
[Swizz Beatz]
Cash rules everything around me, cream

Money in the air, money in the urr-urr
Money in the air, money in the urr-urr
Money in the air, money in the air
Let me see it up, nigga, you don't need that dough
Nigga, you don't need that dough

i've got perfect misinterpret
handful of my family tree
dress rehearsal death and birth
we'll sing inside my key
i watched the sun set
i saw the snow fall
i stole paint to write your name on the stone wall
we made some babies
we made some messes too
trying to do our best to push all of the blessings through
half life gets spent behind a wheel
tryin to claim innocent while i assemble my appeal
the blood and bones are pure as the tears
you could skip a stone and hit a full jury of my peers
but don't judge yet, just let the love get you wound up enough
to beat the sound off the drum set
and point your voice at the void
rejoice, make noise like you had the choice
it goes.. over flow how much more can you hold
and still put faith first at the fork in the road
search for the universal remote control
while the words spill out of the hole in your soul
now close your eyes and crack a smile if you know me
while i spit into the sky cause i miss the little homie
guess that it means if my people hurt
somebody, please disturb my peaceful smirk
take everything that i bring with me
make who i be now,
hear my family now

Ultraviolet dreams
Take a hit of that stuff

3030 way past the millennium, check it out
Yo, Deltron thunderforce, ain't no other source of sunlight
Two ton mic, leave you toungue-tied
Runnin amuck with technology with no apology
Shoutin out to my colony with third eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it - your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets they glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin, man and metal blends
Underground chillin with the Mole Man, and his whole fam
Inhibit bacterial growth, material wrote
Impenetrable, incontestable, indigestible intelligence
Never let a computer tell me SHIT
It's rapid innovation, penetratin
Artificial life forms, who bite songs
I'm a buy a vest, lie is next, then I'll flip the bio-techs
Right into the wireless; your third eye is hit with psoriasis
The mightiest, Deltron Zero
Traverse and purge the travesties that tempt your earholds
The area of distribution, lifts the clueless
My flow is like, liquid oxygen
Rip it often with specific impulse, increasin thrust
Grease the cuts - unleash a cluster of thoughts I muster
I talk to touch ya, and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar energy, into imagery
In the mind's eye, blindside the contagious
With radioactive isotopes to decay them
Atomic mass they small as fragments
I magnetize the avid lies
My radiation shields reflects, rejects Decepticons
Who take the truth and stretch it long, while I bless a song
Next level incredible, metal melding
Flexability and my engine is never failing
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do, some can't be done"
"Things you can do..."
All your rhyme histories combined couldn't violate
The Prime Optimus operative
Use my hydrometer to see how warm you are, watch me form a star
Hydrogen turned to helium when I shine
Ridin 'em revealin 'em leadin 'em to the vacuum
Interact with tunes in my digital citadel
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you
Spit infinity, hiden energies too dope for our planet
Star spannin, slammin hymms with
Mechanical limbs, scanning your lens
With cosmic rays, you'll all get played, your brain's inferior
I hit the lateral AND posterior
My science is eerier
Ionic bonding for your moronic pondering, meet the armorines
My micro machines, might throw your team, into paralysis
They not talented, just a malady
Worry 'bout a salary, creative casualty
Couldn't defrag my power density intensity
Nonequivalence, nine hundred Newtons
Crush you like croutons, you plus Houston
Hiero's like dipoles inside a silo
Turbulence ten-fold, never simple
Defies accepted methods development most unique
Paralyze central nervous when you close to me
Interstellar void fills with color, appears to bubble
And split into four like amoeba
Inhabitin planets with, grandiose boast
And coast like Silver Surfer, feel the purpoise
High velocity, verbal atrocities
Fire resistance, better hire assistants
My pistons glisten ultra, high performance
Inside your private quarters where I fry your components

Hey, hey, hey... hey...
Hey, hey, hey... heeey...
[Chorus:]
Ooh ask me my nigga
The only one there that'll be my nigga
And I'm gon' finally be free my nigga
But you don't have to follow me my nigga
Oh yeah it's still love my nigga
And I ain't gon' stop just because my nigga
? Daddy Paxson? always does my nigga
And always remember what it was my nigga
La da da da... la dadadadada... [x4]
[Verse 1:]
When we were friends, the days would begin and end
Went from boys to men, we boys 'til then
We know each other real, we know each other rules
And we wore each other's clothes and each other's shoes
But in an instance, the days become distance
Your path doesn't go in the same direction his went
And can't help but be scared
Of the virtually unknown up ahead (I heard what you said)
But I'll be fine
Whether it is favor or failure, it must be mine
Well he can stand still, if that's how that man feel
Cuz what can't can't and whatever can will
So I'm walking toward my future with my back to it
Hoping you look up and see me as a reason to do it
When you get grown it's a given
You damn near gotta do the same thing for a living
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
And my cousin I love him like a son cause I was him
And he think his thuggin' pleases me but it doesn't
How could I applause it when I had caused it
But if it's God's plan for him, I guess I ain't cost shit
For what I gave him - wasn't so bad I couldn't save him
Either they'll enslave him or a gun'll grave him
I still believe in him but he think I'm leavin him
When I be busy he think I'm bob-n-weavin him
I probably sound like his daddy
But over the phone, cause I ain't around - like his daddy
When we talk I wanna hear you be productive
Conversate for hours 'bout something constructive
But it never come up
With all them niggaz round your neck you ain't gon' never come up
Maybe I'm jealous cause you love them more
Can't understand what you love them for
Don't get me wrong you know I love them too
But you know who I always hold above them, you
And it ain't nobody business
I'll just make believe that music can miraculously mend this
So I'll be a sound
And then you do your thing to it and we mix it down
And make a song my nigga, cause even when I'm away I'll always be around
[Chorus]

Tonight's the night I get in some shit (yeah)
Deep Cover on the incognito tip
Killing motherfuckers if I have to, peeling caps too
Cause you niggas know I'm coming at you
I guess that's part of the game; but I feel for the nigga
Who think he just gonna come and change thangs
With the swiftness, so get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigga maxing at the top
(I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop)
Kingpin kicking back while his workers slang his rocks
Coming up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
(But I got the hook up with somebody
Who knows how to get in contact with him)
Hit him like this and like that
Let em know that I'm looking for a big fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it
On a nigga's time, and a nigga's place
Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker
But I gives a fuck; cause I'm going Deep Cover
Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)
Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)
Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood
Maniac, lunatic, call me Snoop Eastwood
Kicking dust as I bust, fuck peace
And, the motherfuckin punk police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take yo' ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre (what up Snoop?) Yo, I got the feeling
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright, and I'm chilling
Killing, feeling, no remorse, yeah
So lets go straight to the motherfucking source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be getting niggas a gang of time
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
.. and make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock (so what's up nigga?)
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a uzi, and my motherfuckin twenty-two
So if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!
("I can feel it!")
Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)
Yeah, and you don't stop
(Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop)

Everybody wanna roll like us, smoke

Ain't no puzzle y'all, we, uh
Groovin off the spirituality, and it feels good
I got somethin to say though
It's time for somebody to take over the West Coast power with fly style
And I'm the one, been here for years so check your file
Cuz I'm the kinda nigga with a strong desire
To nutt up, light a torch, and set the world on fire!
See me bouncin in my 'Vette, Doin' donuts in the middle of a Reseda
Wit Rosarita, tryin' to find some place to eat her
Cuz I'm freaky with a capital L
I'll beat up that little pocket pita til there ain't nothing left
I'm nasty
See, we gets better when you think we hot
And we got more cheddar than they think we got
Cuz see we make the kinda money that when we withdrawl
They notify the feds cuz it's too much y'all
What you call a stash, we call it petty cash
Spend five or six figures a month ain't left a gash
Party all night, then we sleep all day
Drink Corona X for breakfast then we ready to play
I still like 'em green eyed big ol' titties and thighs
Big ol' nigga, little heart, and I'm big into thighs
So shoot your game baby girl, don't be scared to take a pet
You never know, it just might be wet
We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly
Now whether or not I be drunk off a gallon a Moet
I can still make the beats stink like some salmon croquette
Go to the hood and get all the kids that I can fit
In a limo take 'em to the store and buy 'em some shit
Give 'em a demo of my new shit cuz it's the shit
And let 'em know that they the shit
And they can make hits cuz it ain't shit
I gotta keep the cycle goin, baby doll
Whichever way the wind be blowin', I'm goin'
Higher than a motherfucker, Mr. Dante
C'mon B back me up each and everyday
Whether it's hot, whether it's cold
Whether it's soft, whether it's bold
Whether it's new, whether it's old
Whether it's GOLD, platinum, I stack 'em
Dante, baby dog, we be fly
Freestylin' like a motherfucker don't ask why
Cuz this ain't Budweiser
"BUD", "WEIS", "ER"
"Did you see the, thighs on her?"
We nastier then a motherfucker baby doll
Can I freak your shit, and, uh, break the sugar walls down?
To the pound pound, uh huh
Elements, Feel my elephant, hahaha
We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly
Now can y'all feel that? See, ain't nothing but God mackin' goin' on right
Now, see? Da game is to be told and not sold dependin' on which game it is
And we gon' keep it way real, you know? Cuz' it ain't no doubt in nobody's
Mind that I'm a very blessed individual, there. If we don't turn it around and
Give it back than we can't we can't go forward, it's up to you. That's what we
Do everytime we get on this microphone, we let 'em know that we might be
Street rappers, but we are very much in order, and we got somethin' to say. So
If you feelin' me like we feelin y'all, get yo ass up on the ball. Time to
Take this shit back. All of it. Cuz it was ours to begin with. Don't sleep
Baby. Don't sleep homey. Now when the hook come back again
Youknowwhati'msayin?
We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly
We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly
We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly

[Verse 1]
Chino, name in Indian: Murdering bear
Come fuck with me I put shotgun shells in your ear
Out of fear they've destroyed my carrier
Have nothing left
But I will have my revenge in this lifetime or the next
I experience road rage, walk in a slow pace
Killed a handicapped man for parking in a regular parking place
Learned my art with a leatherface, you must be kidding
I consider myself a dog trainer: I'm most bitten
But I've been written a billion bars of dissin
for any rappers dead or livin that we've ever heard since we was children
My brain got built-in Pentium chips, my thoughts the fastest
For Shakespearian actors: "Chino shall busteth your asseth,
When I spithed acid" ... yeah your freestyle was tight
You better rhyme of the head good, you can't read or write
A bittin' kid that'll get twist if he front, no publicity stunt
His life flashes by his eyes quicker than Black History Month
What!
(Chorus)
Yo'
Who the only star on WB?
That would be me!
Who the mami's think is so sexy?
That would be me!
Who the illest nigga outta Jersey?
Yo, That would be me!
Who your wife he let fuck her for free?
That would be me!
Who get your ass shot dead in the street?
That would be me!
Who stand damn near six foot three?
That would be me!
Who got lyrics, jewels and plenty money?
That would be me!
Start drama and see the illest papi, yo' what would be me!
[Verse 2]
Yo', Yo'
You wanna be a soldier but ain't reppin' it right
Try me... metal detectors going off for the rest of your life
No matter how hard it gets,
I rather be a soldier drowning in my own blood
Not a coward in my own piss
Focus!... What the fuck you niggas think?
I roll with killers that spent more time in the pen than ink
Don't even blink, and turn your voice down a decibel
Or start lookin' for studios that's wheelchair-accessible
Leave you a vegetable, trust,
I have the letters on your FUBU sweater standin' for "Fucked Up By Us"
We thrust into beef now
Grill holds back like a Lee nail
You yell as you reach hell
You still wanna E-mail she males
Your train of thought derails
Lost dog, here's the details:
I make you think you on a beach how I make you SEE shells/Seashells
My L.A. airport beef was infamous,
I whooped ass the entire five hour flight
Plus three hour time difference
(Chorus)
Yo'
Who your girl made you pay to come see?
That would be me!
Who the only star on WB?
That would be me!
Who the mami's think is so sexy?
That would be me!
Who the illest nigga outta Jersey?
That would be me!
Who your wife he let fuck her for free?
That would be me!
Who get your ass shot dead in the street?
Yo, That would be me!
Who bench press about three fifty three?
That would be me!
Start drama and see the illest papi, yo' what would be me!
[Verse 3]
Yo'
I ain't from Atlanta but I'll leave you outcasted/+OUTKASTED+
And blasted, all fucked up like Schwarzenneger's accent
You has been, I split you apart
I spit from the heart
Yeah you iced out... that's how you slid off the chart
Blindfolded as I sit in the dark, a swoll beast
No peace, big Chi have the police calling the police
I call Aziz, omnipotence
Smoking I shine in its open
We ain't scared of jail we wanna go back
Blast in yo' back, nine bullets in the column of your spine
More than Columbine and Palestine combined, Forty-eight track
Half spic, half black
Sex symbol to the media
Keep my number listed so my beefs can find me easier
In sales you ain't dealing with me
I'm Puerto Rican and I got enough relatives to buy me platinum living with me
I never will be, overthrown... I'm unbelievable
Like the fact that D'angelo's baby's mom is Angie Stone
What!
(Chorus)
Yo'
Who the only star on WB?
That would be me!
Who the mami's think is so sexy?
That would be me!
Who the illest nigga outta Jersey?
That would be me!
Who your wife he let fuck her for free?
That would be me!
Who get your ass shot dead in the street?
That would be me!
Who stand damn near six foot three?
That would be me!
Who got lyrics, jewels and plenty money?
That would be me!
Who bench press about three fifty three?
Who writes hits like B-I-G?
That would be me!
Who go to war like P-A-C?
Yo, that would be ME!
Who carry gats like he crazy?
That would be me!
Who getting' rich still rock lyrically?
That would be me!
Who never lose street mentality?
That would be me!
Who let you live cus you comedy?
That would be me!
Who bring that rock star energy?
That would be me!
Start drama and see who rides for Jersey, yo' that would be me...

Had the whole fam stressed, got signed to a deal
They signed me a check, I signed them a check
Got my whole fam set (Got my whole fam set)

Now I'm fresh out the Bentley, check on a friend
Dipset south, flat screens in the house
Seven-thirty dipset, bitch in a mouth

Party on the counter, just for you rattin his cowards
I need to hit y'all with guns with horsepower
Freak is a real dude in the state remington
Don't need the cage cuz the bird's in the engine
Just bought a crib, eight rooms, all kitchens
And I pimp so hard, I need to stop, make the women
But they don't feel me though
I give it to you girl, put yah planted on my boat, let me rock your world
See I got a whole lot of style, a whole lot of grace
Presidential wait, the funerals in the safe

All night everyday
You can have it your way baby

All night everyday
Beats keep bumpin' 'round my way
All night everyday
Body needs my super cream
Get me paid, get sprayed, hang wit' homies that's made
Come through ya town, put it down like a parade
See I come from Detroit and it's all about Dylan
When I Black Jack five dollas stacked to the ceiling
In my V12 'Boomin' Words' straight from Hell
Blaze green all day, tell me what do ya smell
Bump the beat up in city heat, double-oh-7
East side I ride, AK-47
You can get a lap dance for less than 20 dollas
Playas in my city known for poppin' they collas
The styles that you runnin' 'round wit' is ours
You and them 'Shady' suckas is nothin' but cowards
Bang ya brains in the dirt, make ya go bezerk
If you rap wit' Emily, your ass gon' get murk
I'm the E to the S to the H-A-M
If I wasn't then why would I say I am
Pull a jack, sell a sack ''cause the babies need similac
You remember that rollin' in a Cadillac
You want to' battle rap, I swing the battle axe
Chop ya head off until Hailey go tattle that (da-da)
[Chorus]
All night everyday you can have it ya way
I gotta clock my pay from Detroit to LA
Ok, it's Heather Hunter not the 'Number 1 Stunna'
In the Collady Fair, fast as the Road Runna
The bitches they speak about, the freak of the week no doubt
Ya man was late for dinner ''cause he was eatin' me out
I get it on like that ''cause I was born like that
Ya man jacked off to my porn in fact
'Cause it's too hard to mack me
I be 'Cummin' on America' 'Action and Jack me'
Cream on, Heather Hunter, twice as nice
Screw the right thing and watch the ice bling
So tell me how you want it, push or pull
2Pac was ridin' me on a mechanical bull
It's all I think about, when I be puffin' on a blunt
Plus I give head like a Shaolin Monk
[Chorus]
I used to pick up a pan
My friend keep a CD in the van
People to win you can
NATAS back now, suckas don't slack now
No time to act now, me on the East Side
Rollin' the E ride, girls can come slide
Into the dark room, emotional heart room
Bass can bang-boom, X and mushrooms
Hotels paid for, freakin' in all the rooms
Girls, booties get live tonight, spread the lap dance
Why'all get high tonight, ladies in love
On my jock, and cry tonight, suckas say 'Why tonight'
Pick up the hotline, baby, you think ya fine
I'll putcha first if ya want to be the girl of mine
Wine and dine, puffin' chronic, crime
Move ya curse, grab ya purse
Me and E shootin' fireworks
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-fireworks

Polly with cats, sipping on a 40 of brew
Pulled out the Dutch Master
Cause it's time to get on
Turned on the truck system to pump a hip-hop song
Five minutes later I see these other kids clocking
Meanwhile my niggas chalmed out with system rocking
Saying in my mind, who could it be?
As he got closer, I peeped, it was the E-Double E
I said, "What up Duke?"
Yo, whats up Sundullah?
I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
Yo, why didn't you?

Copped a 40 and a Dutch, and hopped right back in

Straight dumpin, no love for the badge and the gun
Straight accomplices, now our ass is on the run

Bitches flipped, hit PMD with the steel

And asked him how it feel, jumped right
Back in grabbed the wheel
Told the cats to relax and yo, peep the deal

Said, "It's time to move"
[Erick Sermon]
Ran up on him, he looked like he saw a ghost
Tried to run, but J pulled out
And flashed the toast
[Parrish Smith]
Toast told him to bend over, and
Then the girl lift her dress
Pulled out a dick, laced him in
The ass, and asked him
How he liked it, kid was crying in pain

Yo it's "The Dream Shatterer" strictly for cream team battler
Ring rattlin microphone fiend spline splatterer
King of the throne, bringin it home five nights
Up in The Source - five mics
Whippin a Porsche - high price
Pumpin the 9-7, rhyme heaven her voice is mindbendin
Imaginin Angie nuttin but panties and my 911
That's what I'm reppin the thug tech and the glove
Step in the mud with less than a SCUD I'm splittin your rug
It's just I'm in love with Mrs. Martinez
Latin Goddess or Venus, you just happen to give me the hardest {penis}
You wanna see us apart, you're chasin the dark
Long as she run the battle she got a place in my heart
[Remy Martin]
Yo.. yo, yo, yo
All of a sudden the big question is, yo who this bitch Remy-nisce?
Is she really thorough with her borough, can she represent?
Do Remy write every line and every rhyme that she spit?
Is she, really the shit, is her flow really sick?
Get off my dick, keep your sorry ass compliments
I get mad quick y'all knowin me ain't got no sense
Bitch don't try to play me, because you not a player
Believe me, you don't really wanna see my gangster
It's easy to cock back and smack the shit out a hoe
Had to leave niggaz bleedin just so we could get our dough
It get me heated, that's why I wild out for no reason
on the Bruckner, like fuck you, gettin weeded and speedin
I'm untouchable nigga I ain't never have love for you niggaz
cause y'all pussy that's why I ain't never fuck with you niggaz
Motherfuckers is scandal, on the avenue of Randall
Don't slip into some shit you and your click can't really handle
I ain't havin it, get the cash out the cabinet
before I stab the bastard baby in the bassonet
I'll, body a botty bwoy, blow his gut open
Leave son chokin, gun still smokin
Know how many niggaz like, "I bet you Pun wrote it"
Y'all can all take a dirty dildo and deep throat it!

You're the only girl that I have ever wanted
Every other girl is trying to be you
My mama says that I should write you letters
But I think you're with other dudes
Take my hand, you'll like it
You don't even have to call
Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry
Take my hand
You don't even have to call
You're somewhere out there after all
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted

[ INTRO ]
[ KM.G ]
Yo, what's happenin Cold 187
[ Cold 187um ]
Yo man, you know we just laid back in the studio
With the homie D.O.C. and Dr. Dre
[ KM.G ]
And we ballin with the homie Eazy-E
[ Cold 187um ]
Yeah, 'bout to put this piece together for Laylaw
See what he think about
[ KM.G ]
True, true
[ Cold 187um ]
So as the beat reaches a lower kind of level
We gon' put some mega shit together
Now we gon' drop it a little bit somethin like this
[ VERSE 1: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
This song is Ballin', let me drop some dope lyrics
Make it high and fly, so all of y'all can hear it
It's time to build, so take this chill pill
If your cups are empty, go get a re-fill
Of whatever, cause ain't nothin changed but the weather
KM.G - 187 - yo, we got it together
And in the back - who is that? The men with the mack
Yo, I had to have the homies cause they got the sack
And on the tables - what? The two be cookin
When it comes to rockin, they wrote the book, and
If you don't believe me, hurry, come see our show
You'll see me - KM.G, Total K-oss and Go
What? Ballin while the freaks keep callin
Beggin KM.G to come bump the walls in
The house, but even if she has the spouse
(What's up?) She starts that fiendin (what happens?) she gets turned out
And at our concerts we always do work
For the fags, the hags, the rags and the jerks
Cause we ballin
(I'ma recite a little poetry for y'all
The name of this piece is called)
Ballin'
(And I want to dedicate this piece to all your players)
[ VERSE 2: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
See, I'm a baller, and I watch my back
And when I'm ballin, yo, I gotta be packed
If I ain't packed homeboy, you could say I'm slippin
But if you try to run up, I'ma say you trippin
Cause I'm a giant, and to you new jacks
Don't come up and start, because you're gonna get smacked
It's the hood, I thought it was understood
Just like Eazy-E said we mobbin Robin Good
We'll take yo shit, because you ain't legit
You got a fucked up style of rap and without the kick
It ain't nothin homie, you be frontin
Rollin down the 'Shaw and you think you be humpin
On laces? He look just like a lacehead
Before you hit my corner, somebody be dead
Cause I'm a baller, and I won't settle for less
Put Lorenzos on my Benzo, so I know it look fresh
A 500 with a convertable top
Just like the homie Amp we like our shit drop
Straight lowrider, yeah, we do a little ???
Smooth check your hoe, even if I don't know her
And as I enter the door, watch the freaks start callin
The simple fact is (what's up) that we ballin
(I'ma recite a little poetry for y'all
The name of this piece is called)
Ballin'
(And I want to dedicate this piece to all your players
And all you ladies out there)
And you know we gotta break it down for who?
(The whole wide world)
[ VERSE 3: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
Since the breakdown was dope, you can't get enough rappin
I know that it's true, because I seen your hands clappin
Toes tappin, the freaks are jockin
All because the way 187 is rockin
All you busters on the scene
I keep my Locs on because I know you on fiend
Like a spectator, you jock what I'm doin
So sit back and learn, cause it's time for some schoolin
And rulin all the busters on the center
Get off my tip, cause I'm about to enter
This phase (what is it?) that I call the finale
I made it ride higher while I'm ballin through Cali
So listen, I'm finna start dissin
All you Eastside rappers, you had to start pissin
Me off, you're soft, you're finna get tossed
By two boss players who's your dope rhyme sayers
K-oss and Go Mack are the wack-deejay-slayers
You got a beep? We gotta go,cause money is callin
The simple fact is - yeah, that we ballin
And you know
It's like that in 90
And it's gon' stay like that
And once again we have to send it to who?
(The whole wide world)
Who's it dedicated to?
(The whole wide world)
To who?
(The whole wide world)
Dedicated to who?
(The whole wide world)
It's dedicated to
(The whole wide world)
Sendin it out to
(The whole wide world)
It's dedicated to
(The whole) (world) (wide)

Hold ass,Hoes ask for a lap dance
Im tossin mo trash than a trashman wit a trashcan
Lew Hawk just started a business on Gulf Bank with that man
Delivers mo bricks than a freethrow from shaq's hand
Chamillionaire knows guys, and Hollywood Clique make dough rise
When spinnin' on wheels of fortune, the chopper is yo prize
If you tryna compliment elbows and the way the spokes ride
You can see clear, I got glasses like a man with four eyes
Wise like four wise guys, that's nice, but what else?
Screens fall like the pants on the man jumping with no belt
Screens fall like a crippled man tryna get up wit no help
If u was me, you would Ooo!, be impressin' yo-self
Hoes melt like an ice cream sundae, when I'm posted up on Sunday
On MLK in a Hundai, I could still live with ya honey
If she yellow as the cheddar on some macaroni
Betta ask yo homie, I'll take her whether you strapped or phony
At the Shoney's, in in the pool with ya darlin'
Me, Paul and Hawk ballin',Spider Man chrome crawlin'
Come through ya t.v. screens fallin' showin green like a garden
No buffet at olive garden, beg my damn pardon
Them boys in Orleans be throwin fights and riots
Let's have a moment of silence while they show you some violence
I know boys with dirt work ,like a washing appliance
If you see a triple beam, then it isnt... **Scratches Out**

Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole cd
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done
Bringing back sweet memories
Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
Bringing back sweet memories
Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)
Bringing back sweet memories
Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun
Like wow!
We made it
We here

Expanding the depth of your brainpower
Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn) this jam's beyond comprehension
Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song that's beyond comprehension

Intro:
Can't hold on.
Hook:
Hold on is what they say
But I say open up your hands and let it fly away
Until the day it comes back and it was meant to be
Take a look at the lovely gift the world has sent to me
Don't suffer you got to maintain
The rougher the storm gets the more they complain
They don't aim
They shoot sporadaically
Panicky and so dramatically
He ran frantically
Summarized by the look in his eyes
He couldn't hold on after one too many tries
Verse 1:
He held on tight
He put his arm around it and he squeezed with all his might
Don't fight
You should let it go
And sooner than you think it will be right back at your door
Open it up if your open up to learn
Got your head between your legs hoping it returns
They're not concerned
They're so continuous
No matter what my opinion is it's all strenuous
Summarized by the look in his eyes
He couldn't hold on after one too many tries
She held on tighter
She put her arms around it because she knew it would excite her
Don't fight her
You should let it go
And sooner than you think it will be back at your door
Open it up if you're open up to learn
Got your head between your legs hoping it returns
They're not concerned they're so continuous
No matter what my opinion is it's all strenuous
Summarize because she was not wise
She couldn't hold on after one too many tries
Hook

In today's music news, the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
Just released another album under the alias Makaveli
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
On Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G. and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from 'Hawaiian Sophie' fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is why'd they get
This nigga started? Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available
For comment but released this statement
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money
Riders and punks, which side are you on?
These niggaz is still fucking talking?
You niggaz still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for your cockroaches
(All day, everyday)
It's the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(The pump in yo' ass)
This is it nigga, Killuminati style
(Outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the Don, solo shit, bring it
Allow me to introduce first, Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the Holy Qu'Ran
Niggaz get shook like 5-0
My forty-five gun's next to me when we ride, for survival
Money making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes 'cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of Graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dopefiend's titty, huh, in every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggaz down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggaz ducking from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down to Hell is where we send 'em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gon' cry
Me, a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper 'til I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggaz but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggaz down to die for me? Yeah yeah
West coast ridah, coming right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit me
I want money hoes sex and weed
I won't rest till my road dawgs free, bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo' life and I'ma bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life and I'ma bomb first
For so many days and some many ways we've been ducking strays
They delivers but we still some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do and that's ride for the 'cause
Yes, I'll die for the cause
Ya, best believe if I'ma leave this bitch, yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muh'fucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made Paparazzi
If you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfucking cash mayne
Then what is your motherfucking purpose?
None can serve us
E.D.I. Amin born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch
Come on, bring it, we'll stick with it
Come on, bring it
Your style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, y'all niggaz lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin, yer telling fairy tales dunn
'King of New York', like you the motherfucking one?
But I'm from Jerz and we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to North Bricks, all my niggaz flipping chips
Getting rich, even though it's hard
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolv' with no warning signs
'Cause yo my man took five
Now, I'm the young one with the nine
Ready to put in my time
Shoot first, look at they head burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize and bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize and bomb first

Late in the midnight hour
When you really feel like you need a little love
And the man ain't nowhere around
And that can get to you sometimes
Early in the morning (early in the morn)
When you really feel like you need someone to hold on to
When the man ain't nowhere around
And that can get to you sometimes
And what I gets to you most of all
Is when the holidays roll around
You got always to be by yourself
'Cause that's the time when the families get back together
All the in laws come to visit
In laws, been off, did wrong
For the right reasons
'Cause I remember when you used
Your whole stash is my
Shorty bald headed, when it snow she brain freeze
From the bottom, is where I seen the top
Then I said fuck friends man I need the drop
Ride alone by my lonesome
Own some, real estate, threee square's finna shake
Get in bed
Banana clip, rain on gorillas, Bathing Ape
Amazing grace, find God anyway, bigger Ma$e
Switch coupe's and ball
Ski-mask today and suits tomorrrow
Plaques and Oscars, crabs and lobsters
Get your face book, right on Facebook
Lifetime picture, I hope the size fits ya
I guess a favour ain't enough, they wanna lay your life
A rusty deuce deuce, turn your brains to couscous
John Wall hot, ghost boy, ghost rap
Do it too easy, Dee Brown, closed eyes
Four door Paul George, pacer
Medication, from the gutter with no education
With a girl like you I could hit the top
Coke Boy baby 'til my casket drop
Ain't no mercy for the weak if you need a cure
This is pure, wavy way before it hit the shore
They don't respect nothing, money will rise
Rest in peace, moment of silence
There was you, there was me
You did you, I did me
When the tables done turn, drinkin' liquor with sour burn
Showed you that, money and power

(Now I got to cut ya...)
Yeah ha ha that's right. 'Cause it's like this
Yeah it's gotta be like this. Nigga.
Verse 1
It used to be a CPT thang (what)
but now it's just an all me thang (yeah)
because I'm tired of this gizame (right)
I'm through playin' for a crew
that ain't got my back
when I'm the one who done
created the sack
Mister You Know Who remember me
I met you when I was P.P.C.
and you wadn't nothin' but a scrub
wearin' plaid pants and bubble gums
and beggin' for grub
and then when ya hips start growin'
you tripped and flipped and skipped out
know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Not even thinkin' 'bout the times
when Kay Kay took yo' ass in
'cause you didn't have a dime
Nigga couldn't even say thanks for the trouble
I would've spanked yo' ass on the double
'Cause when ya didn't have a place to stay
you little round the way girl
my nigga took yo' way
and that way all my homies had yo' back
Because together they knew we had a fat ass sack
but you couldn't stand the guns
Couldn't wait to take ya
(AMG)
money and run
Kay Kay should've knew the motto of life (what's that)
that ya can't turn a hoe into a housewife (ha ha)
Because you left a lot of people unhappy nigga
You in debt and ya need to get at me
Chorus
I'm gonna let ya know it (that's right)
I'm gonna let ya know it (so ya need to get at me)
I'm gonna let ya know it (huh)
I'm gonna let ya know it (you need to get at me)
Verse 2
Now I can name a gang of niggas I done tripped with
spent a grip with and they ain't spent shit
and they ain't never brought nothing to the table
But it ain't no puzzle I'm able
but why you want to take my kindness for weakness
To get my money back
I gotta ride yo' ass like Preakness
it ain't that fly
and when ya see me in traffic just ride by
You should've been a pigeon
'cause you duck so well
but next time I catch you I'ma pluck yo' tail
'Cause niggas like y'all show disrespect
by flossin' so you in for a tossin'
You need to go brush your teeth
and change ya drawers and change ya sheets
and stop y'alls bitches
from steadily tryin' ta ride on my mink
And start bathing more than once a week (nigga)
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout bitches
so ya needs to come right with a quickness (come right)
and instead of tryin' to duck and dodge
and be crafty you need to get at me.
Chorus
I'm gonna let ya know it (hell yeah)
I'm gonna let ya know it (you need to get at me)
I'm gonna let ya know it (that's right)
I'm gonna let ya know it (you need to get at me)
Verse 3
So tell me how we gon' handle this
either we gon' be men or we gon' be scandalous
either way is all right with me
'Cause I'ma show ya that I meant it
when I said that I'm a G Nigga
I don't take ganks too swell (naw)
that's why I went and bought a gang of shells
and if you approach me wrong
I'ma clown first nigga run up
"First down."
Damn I wish it didn't even have to come to this
'cause now y'alls on my shit list
right with the white boys in this game
thinkin' they gone get the hits for some chump change
Please huh I didn't believe that you'll trip like that
that's how a gang of niggas flipped like that
so get back fool 'cause I'm going out
comin' out of a straight jacket Blastin'!!
and they gon' have to get at me
Chorus
I'm gonna let you know it. (hell yeah)
I'm gonna let you know it. (you need to get at me)
I'm gonna let you know it.
I'm gonna let you know it. (you know what
y'all can never get at me)
Now battle


Cowboys in a spaceship, the crowd noise is wasted
Women take pics so they can seem naked
Guys tell jokes so they can see 'em naked
Church ladies vote what they perceive sacred
Proposition hatred, phosphorous in riverbeds
Billion dollars spilled to fill esophagus with cigarettes
Philosophers plot to maul nations out of shock and awe
Generation of ideas, children who won't talk at all
Profits fall
Chalk on walls
Years spent on prison cells
Next to die, living hell
His twelve peers didn't exercise their privilege well
Babies raised through the glass
Bullets at the border, war games take a stab
Coordinate who can pass like a paper bag
Minutes on an internet porn page, fornicate make her gag
What's the damage for the neighbor tagged by the amateur?
Water blast erase the trace of the canisters
Water path took the stairways left the banister
Washed over premises, turned up percentages
Lost under sludge, lots of revised sentences
Defense budgets padded by sandbags and sandwiches
Wasted
Drag this baggage, hold this damage
Cope the best that we can manage
Want solutions, need new standards
Cry our beauty from the ashes
Drag this baggage, hold this damage
Cope the best that we can manage
Want solutions, need new standards
Cry our beauty from the ashes
To do list, throw away mail, go buy envelopes
Who's this 'Coulda-been-Rhodes-Scholar-centerfold?
Every day's a resource, to be sure it's integral
The rebirth from t-shirts to minerals
The ward's filthy, search for another light in town
Nobody else home, can't carry their same load
But I feel guilty like the flight went down
And my cellphone wasn't on airplane mode
Soy-based newsprint, black market food stamps
Poison in the Pete moss, suffocated beat box
B-boys in detox, corrugated cardboard
Lockheed lobbyists' floor debating 'Star Wars'
Yeast and fungi, spring-tails ants and nematodes
Sawdust yellow-cake, organics decompose
Bokashi, EM-inoculated, wheat bran
Toxic compounds broken down under coffee ground
Ancient carcasses in the sphagnum lost and found
Empty cartridges from a magnum tossed into
Agricultural lime rock-flour and seaweed meal
Bio-remediate man-made molecules
Wasted
Drag this baggage, hold this damage
Cope the best that we can manage
Want solutions, need new standards
Cry our beauty from the ashes
Drag this baggage, hold this damage
Cope the best that we can manage
Want solutions, need new standards
Cry our beauty from the ashes
Ashes to eggshells, wood-chips to whiskers
Anything we can mess up, we can fix up
Sword to plowshare, soiled from beneath the trash
Detroit Red into El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
Oil drum to steel pan, prisoner to Gramsci
Rose from the concrete
Reverse the flows of the Ponzi schemes
Crip-walk to a conscious beat, hip-hop is a compost heap
Gangsters to gardeners, rivals into partners
Fanatics to reformers, felons into farmers
Inmates to fathers of inner city scholars
Pop-tarts to salad, teens into college
Lawns into restaurants, centerfold models to artists
Police abuse to catharsis
Street sergeants into peace departments
Thousand dollar bill to green for all markets
Back-lots to blacktops and cash crops for have nots
Metal into scrap shops, jobs for the cast-offs
Cracks-pots into earth-ships for urban astronauts
Reservation into reservoir of wisdom
We used to know, use the whole
Animal landfill to future home
Pacifist guerrillas to bazooka zones
Black hawks to attics, C-130's to super-dome
Newborns on computer phones
So the smile's not
Wasted
Drag this baggage, hold this damage
Cope the best that we can manage
Want solutions, need new standards
Cry our beauty from the ashes
Drag this baggage, hold this damage
Cope the best that we can manage
Want solutions, need new standards
Cry our beauty from the ashes

[Talking: Fat Joe]
Cool & Dre
Who you gonna trust?
Yea, you could trust me, haha
[Tony Sunshine]
La la la la la
Oooooh
[Chorus: Tony Sunshine]
I don't care about nothing else my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Oooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
Cuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)
[Talking: Fat Joe]
To all the ladies in our lives, you heard
Strong independent women, come on
Yea, huh
[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I'ma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray I'm on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Armageddon]
Yea how I'm supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that
[Chorus]
[Talking: Fat Joe]
Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you
[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and
[Tony Sunshine]
Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times who will always...
always be my girl
[Chorus] - repeat 2X

You know you're my cookie baby and you're too smart
I can see it in the lines of your school art
True heart
I mean courage
Expressed with care
Go on draw them superheroes with the curly hair
You're my daughter
My love
More than kin to me
This for you and the woman that you finna be
Tell that boy he's wrong
Girls are strong
Next time at show and tell play him our song
Tell your teacher I said princesses are evil
How they got all they money was they killed people
If somebody hits you
Hit 'em back
Then negotiate a peace contract
Life if a challenge and you gotta team up
If you play house pretend that the man clean up
You too busy with the other things you gotta do
If you start something, now
Remember, follow through
Later on you gon' blossom like a lotus
You'll get into boys and the boys gon' notice
It don't matter who you do it with
Just remember when I tell you baby you the shit
Handshakes are promises
Lies can spoil it
Words should be bond and seal
Wash you hands after using the toilet
Brush after every meal
And also
Wear clean draws
Everyday
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit
Wear clean draws
Everyday
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(Yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(Oh yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(Yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there?
(Oh yeah)
My boogie baby now
The world ain't no fairy tale
And it's ran by some rich white scary males
To make it simple for you let's call 'em the bosses
They take money while the people take losses
Stole Black folds from Africa
To work for free
And we still barely get paid enough to eat
That's what I told you
I be saying in my vocals
That's why the woman got the gun on the logo
The star is the future
That we gon' create
Where nobody steal money from the things we make
The revolution takes time and space
But you as a woman gotta know you're place
That's in the front baby
I'm being blunt baby
If the get mad say it's they time of the month baby
Your face is just like the sun when it raises
Thank you for adding beauty to my phrases
Handshakes are promises
Lies can spoil it
Words should be bond and seal
Wash your hands after using the toilet
Brush after every meal
And also
Wear clean draws
Everyday
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit
Wear clean draws
Everyday
'Cause things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(Yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(Oh yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(Yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there?
(Oh yeah)
Clap yo hands

Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Living on borrowed time and borrowed money
Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny
Hand me down food and hand me down clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless
Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
He drinks where he lies
He's covered with flies
He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes
Go upstate and get your head together
Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather
Detox at the flop house no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from
He lives in the street but he's no bum
A rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
A platinum voice but only gold records
On the bass was Boots, on the drums was Checkers
Louis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar
Johnny Ryall
Who do you think you are
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
Donald Trump Donald Tramp living in the men's shelter
Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing "Helter Skelter"
He asks for a dollar you know what it's for
Bottle after bottle he'll always need more
He's no less important than you working class stiffs
Drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss
Paid his dues playing the blues
He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes
Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army
That's right y'all his name is
Johnny
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall

'Tis love which makes the elephant forget
'Tis love which makes the elephant forget
Weary with toil, my soul seeks sweet repose
Yet far from home, no comfort is there to find
My mind at journey's end resumes command
To cast unshadowed doubt (one might suppose)
Our zealous pilgrimage fo sorts unkown
Varied states of enduring discontent
Lead my mind and soul to mortal clatter
Lo thus, my heart ascends the royal throne
And like the thief woh borrows not, but takes
The lover who invokes a jealous rage
With vulgar thoughts spoke venomous in tone
Creates a trembling air, which ultimately quakes
Forgive me not for harboring roguish ways
Not for crude language from a brutal tongue
'tis love which makes the elephant forget
So guilty am I, myself, love shan't acquit

My city call me the Virus, I'm sick with the flu yea you signed to the Game, but I'm sicker than you
Niggas don't mention me, when they mentioning you
Same niggas listen for me, when they listen to you
Virus, I'm the metaphor of Barbarian
What's a Rockstar, bar for bar I'll bury him
I'm blame Game for creating you, he gave u a buzz
Than you blew up but now I'm deflating you
I feel I'm greater I aint hating you
You aint shared the spot light so now I'm erasing you
I aint saying that you not hot nigga
But you putting all the work that made Cyss the top nigga
Battle everybody and told 'em to drop figures
So all this Rockstar shit comes to a stop nigga
Put that on my block nigga, and wit that said
Bag 'em Cyssero the Virus, Rockstar is dead
Man this rap shit easy to me
That's why I got the top spot and that's easy to see
Being the hottest aint easy
But there aint a soul on the globe that can make it look as easy as me
See, I'm G as can be, you a gat flasher
I spit the gat and hit your cap its a rap after
When I clap the black clappa
It sounds like a concer crowd its loud and clap at ya
Yea they call me a arrogant black bastard
Even if you think that you hotter I laugh at ya
Grands on the piece, grand on the bezel
Money man, making hundred grand plans wit my rebels
Wit my hands on the metal you can call me Lucifer
Cause you don't stand a chance in a dance wit the devil
I'm what the streets made me, and wit that said
Bag 'em Cyssero the Virus, Rockstar is dead

[Erick Sermon]
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Well you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you tired, then go take a nap!
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now, I'm bout to shake'n'bake
The E-R-I-C-K is my name, I spell
Thanks to the clientele, yo I rock well
I'm not an MC who talking all that junk
About who can beat who, sounding like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say 'check one-two', and run down the line
[Parrish Smith]
To the average MC I'm known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroy an employ', when your rhymes are not void
Never sweating your girl (Why P?) Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginning, I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy, you gots to chill
("Jungle boogie!")
[Erick Sermon]
I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes, step by step
Make em sound def to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off, in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standing still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control, of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll
[Parrish Smith]
I'm the P, double-E, M-D-E-E
And one thing I hate, is a biting MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks, on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
Cause M.D. stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)
Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy, you got's to chill
("Jungle boogie!")
[Erick Sermon]
Catch every word I'm saying, no there's no delaying
Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playing
Seeing is believing, you catch my drift?
Don't try to a-dapt because I'm just too swift
(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rapping sword
[Parrish Smith]
Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal drone
When I'm pushing on the microphone
Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when it's time, issue diggum-smack
I keep their hands clapping, fingers snapping, feet tapping
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol was packing
The PMD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party, I kill again and again
So if you're thinking bout battling you better come prepared
Come with ya shield and your armor geared
You gots to chill

And we only fucked once is you crazy
So like a titanic if you panic you is guaranteed to sink
I make scrilla like a brink Im rare like a mink
So like a picture-perfect moment, nigga say cheese
Why do I keep runnin if 5-0 say freeze
Fresh adidas creep across the bathroom floor
And never underestimate a sexyass whore nigga

[Intro]
I can't even sleep I been tied to my telephone
We're just newer animals, roll up all the medical
I can clear my mind but I cannot clear my schedule
I try to let it go
(x2)
[Verse 1]
What you been saying, I can't hear ya through the ground love
It's like we did the shipwreck, and no one ever found us
Now we seeing big checks
And the boats helicopters all around us
But if I never lit something
They probably would've drowned us
[Chorus]
'Til we get old, make a bankroll
Take it back home if you know where to go
Change your phone, new zip codes
Let the high Pope come and save your soul
We pop pills, still blow smoke
That's the only way we were taught how to cope
Had no money but we had hope
Had no money but we had hope
[Verse 2]
Shooting for the stars
Tuck it in the waistband, see it in my face man
In and out of cars
Trying to see the day, man
We can make a change and get up out this wasteland
Breaking down the walls
Plotting our escape, man
Get what you can take, man
Making no mistakes, man
Pop a couple bars
Whip it out the case, man
Quarter like I'm Aikman, we could take the place, man
What you been saying I can't hear, you out of town, love?
But if I never made something, you probably wouldn't be around much.
[Bridge]
All your demons
Never die, they just hide
All your demons
Never die, they're inside
[Chorus]

Lord! Dispear, huh!
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Nyabinghi man a Mau Mau Warrior, dispear, eh
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya, dispear, hey
Ayatollah, Idi Amin, Mennelek, man a Masai Warrior, dispear, eh
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya, this spear
Like burning spirits and such and such before me
Who all fought for the cause and, dispear, eh
Enforcing all the laws and
The master of the masses
One has power the other one lacks it
Guns are power controlled by assets owned by financial forecasters
Who are the masters? They are the gangsters, they are the bankers
The ones who tax us, the masses, they are us
The sheep, the people, divided in classes
I go off like a shia bomb and all y'all see I'm on my
War paint on my face, shit
My nine mm on my waist, shit
I'm a problem, shoot up your place shit
Let a few go, then I get low blazing Haze again
The masters, the wall street war chiefs
The elitists groups, the masses
They pray to Jesus saying he will see us through
The masters are the aristocratic
The masses ask if the most high is on his way here
I'm trying to stay clear, my mind is my modern day spear
Hey I say, dispear, huh!
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a Gideon man a Mau Mau Warrior, dispear, eh
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya, dispear, hey
Through the hands of time and cruel men it has slew more than a billion, dispear, eh
It keep on suppressing the humble man's opinion
This lead into Swiss cheese when the 5th squeeze
Mislead the media misleads
Scares you to the point where you miss sleep
With that said this lead with this Ruger and that shooter
Sub-machine gun ratta tat through you
Copper tops, hollow points will do ya something bad our future
Is Mislead three strikes
There's no school when a teacher strikes
This economy, this monopoly get no job just own your property
Now it's back to what comes natural
Must survive any how you have to
Dispear, desperation but I have no fear when I hold this spear
Mek some bwoy know mi nah smile 'cause this spear nah mek friends
Man a run racket man a run scheme man a run race man a run down Benz
Can't trust a she nor we nor eye inna contact lens
Man a run from police and a run down wealth and dollars and nah mek sense
So, rise up to my defense
Hollow pointed is my preference
Should have been deterred don't know what you heard
Get referred by the wrong reference
When this spear start dispense
It a fly and a tear through fence
Dismember your members and all of your limbs body bust inna nuff segments
Well, man a run drugs man a run risk
Man all a run out a time and ends
Man a run up and down and a run fi dem life and a run down this month rent
Nothin' nah gwan a yard and food deh a road then man hafi go touch pavement
Dispear was a tool that was used to enslave man and mek manservant
Escape from despair and desperation becomes more urgent
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul with spiritual detergent
A distant army a distant relative controlling the circumference
And any man move with no permission they're feeling the circumstance of
Dispear, hey
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a, eh man a Mau Mau Warrior, dispear, eh!
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya, dispear, hey
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47, dispear, eh!
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level , dispear
Like burning spear and such and such before I
Who all fought for the cause and, dispear, eh!
They can't ignore me, no!

Yo, and special guests on my show
Is the K
To the S to the O-L-O
And me, the capital D, the O to C
The a.k.a., the P the M the D
And me, the E to the D to the O
To the U to the B to the L to the E
It's time P
To rip the M the I to C
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
K-Solo (yo) I pass P the microphone
Nah black (why P?) to each his own
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass E the microphone
It's me, yes the MC Grand Royal
Who loves rappin, and to it I stay loyal
I can't tell, you ain't caught up in my spell
You dwell on the other crab MC's that fell
Apart from the start, that didn't know the art
Of rappin, to keep the people's hands clappin
But it's me, I know the way it should be
The flow slow, like me and PMD
And that black, will make you real fat
A real swinger, and a real cool cat
Like a jazz player, or someone on the accordion
Producing crazy hits like, if I was Barry Gordy and
Here's a tip, to show you how to rip
A crab in half, and watch his posse flip
So me, the E, I come equipped
Heavy ammunition, so I don't have to dip
So listen, to this funky fresh lesson
The way I drop it, and the way that I was flexin
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
PMD (yo) I pass Solo the microphone
Yo I pass (why Solo?) to each his own
Yo knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Yo, I pass P the microphone
As I take the stage, with the fresh dipped gear
I start to show off, with throw your hands in the air
Because the older I get, the harder I kick
Usin my rap-fu style from a rap-fu flick
Of my Bic oh shit another MC's lit
Like a Jack-o-Lantern, on the Halloween tip
Cause as the bass thumps, VU meters peaks
All pens and pads are drawn, as the teacher speaks
Because a naughty rapper, tried to steal the flow
But the buck stops here, cause I'mma let you know
No swingin, or knuckles, strictly ammo
Cause as I dust bust, crush, and then rush
A sucker new jack, with no if's and's or but's
You roll with the good times, we like to roll with Rush
I drive a 'Ratti (I drives a Benz) you ride the bus
So get out the mustard, crab, because it's time to catch-up
And in the act of war, P refuse to let up
On a gonna-be, wanna-be, soon-to-be, whatever's clever
In any type of weather, cause two birds of a feather
Always flock together
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
K-Solo, I pass E the microphone
I pass (why E? To each his own)
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass Solo the microphone
Yo, my style's aggressive, like a pit bull terrier
Harder it sounds on wax, the more the merrier
Maestro though, releases beats for me
So I can rig up a hit and get paid easily
People, gather round listen to flow
Yo, so I can prove, that I'm the true Solo
Too many suckers, have bit my name in vain
Punk rappers thought I was sleepin, but Solo came
To so many places, other rappers faces
That called theirself Solo, I made em erase it
I'm Solo, no name lender or pretender
Yo, I am the Solo the on-ly solo contender
Duck MC's, grab my name and bit it boldly
Put it behind they name and ate this up like ravioli
I heard on KISS, with Red Alert and Chuck
A rapper said he went Solo, I said, "What the FUCK??!"
My man came over, and said, "Yo, I thought we heard you"
Joke's on you you heard a bitin ass crew
They bit my name, I want it back, and it's a fact
Yo PMD tell em (damn you shouldn'ta did that)
Now for the record, what do I stand for
One lonely rapper on the stage, who gets one, single applause
Give me a break my brother
My name stands for Kevin Self, Organization Left Others
My name's no game for those who claim to use my name
In vain cause their name sounds plain
I remain the same, my flow of style won't change yo
The name of the game is for the real Solo to explain
I don't know was where you ran or came
I know your vein I hate your name
You're ashamed, playin the game that drove you insane
That walk around puddles, snow and the rain
With a cane, nothin to gain but shame
And my momentum of the fast flow of rhyme'll get em tamed
The pain of no fame, no title again, nobody but the real
K-S-O-L-O to blame
When I S-P-E, L-L, very W-E, L-L
People all out there can T-E-L-L
Rhymes that I got, or write will S-E-L-L
For those who don't believe me, can go to H-E-L-L
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Like a B-R-I-D, in the S-K-Y
Don't even T-O-Y to be dat's why
L-I-N-E's belong to M-I-N-E
I'm makin veche, some rappers imitate
Yo f*ck it, Solo here's to make parties sway
People, I won't take any kind of losses
Battlin rappers grabbin the mic and usin resources
Like household utensils, kitchen appliances (becoming silent and fading away)

[Hook]
Ain't it odd everybody want a fucking picture now?
Ain't it odd when I catch you, always catch you in a lie?
Ain't it odd thug niggas sweeter than pumpkin pie?
Ain't it odd that yo fucking jaw ain't broken right now?
Ain't it odd? Ain't it odd? Ain't it odd?
Nigga you a fraud
[Verse 1]
I'm like "Where yo jewelry from"? I wanna cop those
He over east these diamonds cost loads
Ain't it odd I was finna get him robbed?
But it came out the beauty supply at Cosmos ?
Let me call a cab if it ain't about cash
My music get a lot of bumps now I'm a rash
Any bitch talk stupid like Stacey Dash
Gone need candles by they body like a romantic bath
One wrong move you a dead nigga
I ain't bearing with you no Ted nigga
I'm in the gun shop for a extra large
To leave a bitch leaking like some discharge
Pay my money fast now to my Paypal
Like stepping in the Chinese store they "pay now"
You call it cocky I just call it bitch you proud
They see my scale went up they acting fishy now
[Hook]
Ain't it odd everybody want a fucking picture now?
Ain't it odd when I catch you, always catch you in a lie?
Ain't it odd thug niggas sweeter than pumpkin pie?
Ain't it odd that yo fucking jaw ain't broken right now?
Ain't it odd? Ain't it odd? Ain't it odd?
Nigga you a fraud
[Verse 2]
Lil bitch check it out, no doctor got hella hits no boxer
Yo favorite artist on the Freshman cover
I could put him in a headlocker
Once I tell my homies that its going off
They make yo body roll like a bowling ball
Bullshit online I'm a driveby
Remove you off the Internet for good even if you on the WiFi
I ain't talking no bluffery, niggas not touching me
I like to keep the convo shorter than a summary
I'm out here on the grind for that instant guapo
You out here on the grind for a Insta follow
We cut so different we can't even think the same
Couple warrants for my arrest so I'm hiding behind the bangs
I'm David from the Bible known for that good aim
I bet money that yo money shorter than the name James

Stoned is the way of the walk,
Well, it's the Alley Cat puffin' on a hootie rat,
Some think I'm a criminal,
But, yo I ain't all of that,
Hit ya with the baseball bat,
An' ya want to ill though,
Want to mess around,
You get fucked on the hill bro,
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow,
Hits from the bong,

And I'm kickin' it wit' Chong,
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with "Ice Cream",
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream,
Speak it like a rolla', and you know it's rolled tightly,
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' to fight me,
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G,
And any hour of the day ya know I might be,
Harassed by a pig real fast,
They want to Rodney King me,
Always tryin'a crown my ass,
Ain't got no class (No Class)
I hit they' ass like the buddah that's stinky,
They want to scruff but, they' just so rinky-dinky,
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk,
Sen gotts the Philly, an' he's gonna light the blunt,
Sippin' after curfew makes me go koo-koo,
Somthin' like loco then turn in to this loocoo,
Binggin' the beta,yea, now the funk is risen,
Got the beta bass and the nasal highzen,
As I kick atrip, it comin' straight from my sinus,
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco,
I rememba sista Maggie, breast were kinda saggy,
Used to sell me buddah outta fucked up little baggies
Honeyd up a twenty even when I had no money,
She said "Pay me back with some latin dick Sonnie"
Well I neva' went out, and I don' thnk I'm gonna,
Just for some buddah, she wanted me ta bone her,
Demeanin', ya think ya know what I', meanin',

For we are the ones stonin' in the ways of the mastas,
Stoned is the walk,

Hit they ass, hit they ass,

Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man
You know I had t-
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep egging me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
No offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound
That'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes
I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it
I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to
Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off

That's why I don't read the news, it's garbage
And the editor that wrote the thing, he's garbage
Got guys on my back about schedule, saying it's too tough
Well guess what?
It's Division-1 football!
It's the SEC!
Heck, you pledged, didn't ya?
Go play intramurals, brother
Go play intramurals

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I'm about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga I'm from Georgia that's the realest state
[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I'm feeling like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-X
Gotta use that latex or she living like a princess
They don't wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street
Got that generation money my grandkids are assholes
Stacking something dummy every verse I got got cash flow
Monaco they loved me, I'm wearing something ugly
But they still know I'm rich though so my doo-rag lookin' stuffy
Rollin' with the royalty Kauai is just my Camelot
Glasshouse, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top Saint Bart's
Pushin' 997's like I'm making fuckin' phone calls
Half a mill is low bar
Lot of diamonds light bright, whiskey older than Betty White
Spot me on Dalmatian coast, Croatian girls salvation us
Make something of myself man
Somebody let'em know, 'cuz it's that eastside nigga
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
Ridin' around with a whole meal, real estate can a nigga live
Gold slug no ice grill, deal with molly, no ecs pill
Georgia nigga I'm A-town, eastside nation wide
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed them, homicide
Real estate that's my estate Georgia pizza like Big Meech
Mason Ave, that's my street, we sellin' crack on Front Street
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it
New crib, ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it
Baby momma, stank bitch fought child support, I'm too rich
Pissy hoe got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick
My driver license's suspended, but I'm still ridin' in a Bentley
I'm still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin'
Me and Childish Gambino, plenty chips no casino
Poppin' bottles with models they gon' suck us up pronto
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state
Niggas eating off paper plates, we just copped them new Audi 8s
[Hook (x2)]
[Outro 1: Swank]
Man Atlanta showing love too, man
Shout out to Eastside, shout out to Southside, Westside
And for the North side, man them niggas up there be testin'
Ain't nothing changed man, we still get money out here
Royalty forever in this bitch
Gambino nigga, you know what I'm saying?
That new shit man
One time for the one time man, real nigga stand up
Two times for the bad bitches, three for the rich
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what it is man, yeah man
Money talk, bullshit walkin' marathon
Real niggas know what I'm talking about
Royalty forever motherfucker
Gambino forever motherfucker
Get used to it, Royalty nigga, Royalty motherfucker
Motherfucking eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town
We in this bitch like we fucking a dog or some shit my nigga
Man y'all motherfuckers already know what it is
Royalty forever in this bitch, bitch niggas fall back
Real recognize real and y'all sucka niggas ain't it
You feel me? Man don't watch me, watch TV
Wait, 'Bino on that shit too, God damn
Man we gettin' that white people money, you heard that?
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggas what I'm talking about one time
[Outro 2: Tina Fey]
Yeah we in here, we in this thing
Gambino is forever, Royalty is forever
We ballin' 'till we fuckin' up the hardwood homey
This is the life we live, son
My president is black and my Prius is blue motherfucker
Royalty all day, we droppin' racks in Nordstroms son
That's racks on racks damn it
You feel me? You feel me?
This is the part where most people would say something crazy and drop the n-word after it
Not going to, not gonna do that
I don't feel comfortable
I'm out!

blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
no angels guide me i seem to be lost
spittin a rhyme from divious ways
all in the veins them freaks they get paid
the path was layed the bed was set
nicky the cat from the fillmoe jets
here go the stealo it aint that odd
kahn, money, clothes, broads
don't forget weed and rap for the gods
pages that rewrite the holy karahn
man i've been swervin since julius erving
ready to rap now so open the curtain
don't be in the lab when i'm doin bad
pencil's and pads they turn to cash
this how i mash
driving so fast
shoes say wu when i step on the gas
baby is mad
man she got ass
i looked and gave her my gangsta laugh
my pedigree my legacy
i sell it like aphetimines
they told me at the dinner scene
and i'm standing there high in my anchor jean
gangsta's, hustlers, hoe's and all
feel the pain when a rapper falls
blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
no angels guide me i seem to be lost
its mighty extreme to being a king
looking for people to be on the team
how much money it cost to cheat
to slow ya down and be drug free
with kenneth cole boots and sean john suits
and execution that top of the roof
who got the juice
show me some proof
the curser the rhyme give me the loot
awake like an owl and drinkin some tea
watchin fights of muhamud ali
dodgin death with every step
this is my rep give me the checks
like snaggle puss i'll step to the left
with this freak but that quiet is kept
my philisophy is tha boss of me
pass the hot sauce to me
you need diamonds and pearls to floss with me
i stand there with none
hot as a gun
the sound of the noise will make you run
move from the slugs that will rip your lungs
look in the eyes of the greediest god
rollin the streets with the cadi facade
cut through the rain like ninja blades
the batter ramming slang the rage
i got my games from project floors
weed, dope, and dice by the door
crush anything that'll cause a threat
talk to the bookie secure the bet
never with leniency he won't agree with me
gettin all mad when i make the call
gangsta's, hustlas, hoes, and all
feel the pain when a rapper falls
blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
no angels guide me i seem to be lost

I got the sweetest heist, million in cash, another 3 in ice
Who can I trust? Cuban'll bust plus ?good thief the night?
Here's the plan (plan), we nab the man, bring a camcorder
Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
Nah chill, that's too ill, for real I'd rather kill somethin'
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops he's guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels
It's settled, blitt up, put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin' a chance, I've only got one my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran
[Chorus]
Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash a niggas shit like a crash dumy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place
Aye yo the plot thickens, I'm pickin' the locks in the back entrance
Payin' attention, not tryin' to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got poco lock with the down to rock Morocco choke hold (oh oh)
Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin
Inspectin' the vault, for weapons assault, second of course
It's poisonous rays, boiled and baked in epsom salt
Rep in New York is the cat burglar, the fat murderer
Slippin' the clip in the Mac, inserterer
Hurtin' your pockets, droppin' your stock to zero profit
Holding heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like DeNiro mob flicks
Back to the top again, hand the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shining was blinding my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban started movin' for the back real slow
That's when I heard the sirens hopin' that my ears was lyin'
Knew we was dyin' when I saw the guard we tortured cryin'
Pointing at the building screamin', "I can see them, kill 'em!"
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Cuban said, "Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns"
[Chorus: x2]

Verse One:
Get a load of this MC, and that MC
I guess the G does not possess the recipe
You're stale men fell when
inferior complexes of when John flexes
vexes the, competition often stop and listen
in all men men saught in, raw
I bet your best to play to crave the savior
Never let the sweat be seen against me fiending
for an inkling when, the sin retreat
before the score is scuffed, you flunk again
I recommend that you step, or I deck your chin
then I grin cause you slept, you kept your
Face placed in the spot from, first to last
Now listen up as Cas come burst that ass
Basically, your crew stunk
Here's your grade chump, you flunked
Chorus:
Like that and uh, MC's just flunked (4X)
Verse Two:
It's vital how I pull tricks up off my jock
Sticks and stones breakbeats and bones
make fleets of clones, drop
Sway as I say an essay, will impress a critic
Critic the way I bring a flow, get it
I'm the dopest, admit it
Regurgitate when you bit it
Ex-Lax the skills of a poet that's the shit
and he know it, I swat em seek em out, and close in-
-tro blows internally damaging men pos-ing
I suppose thin tracks are always wack
It all pays back when you stays fat
Like that and uh, like this and uh
This man'll, show you how to flow, dope
Simply stating my standpoint on the, spunk
Basically, you flunked
Chorus
Chorus Two:
Like that, the competition, they just flunked (4x)
Verse Three:
It's curtains, the way to adjust, must just be
bearing with the tearing and ripping
that I'm inflicting, from where the proper shit
of my begin when, tricks lead your saliva
is deep in my dick, clean I need a remedy from men that be
All into me, they might fall into the abyss
As I twist these melodies
Hella MC's seize these fellas be
prolific, with it, all intact
Keep in touch even though I'm only callin back
wack, you're week-er than seven days
You should find a way to bring a weaker thought like crime pays
I simply the peak in rhyme divinity when it be
up to me, for the funk
Higher like this, higher like that
I got your brain again, you flunked
Chorus
Chorus Two

Okay,okay,okay, yes sir
Hell Rell, J.R. Writer, forty
This is how we do it, maan
I am one of a kind, yeah
It's now or never, nigga
Time's up, muthafucka
Let's do this
Aiyo, I stop paying for coke, get bricks on the muscle
Gorillas on they bullshit, welcome to the jungle
Fiends get served in the hallway, welcome to the hustle
Where bitches do anything for a hit of that glass dick
When I'm outta town, nothing less than a half brick
One-Sixty on the dash, nothing less than a fast whip
I floss when it's sunny, got money for a rainy day
In the dope spot a few blocks from where the Yankees play
Man, I'm heavy in that BX borough, we ain't gotta front for nobody
We just thorough and I'm sittin' on an arsenal, rockets and the missiles
Took my advance and got my strip poppin' with them nickels
And when I'm in ya neighborhood, you gotta go hide
Deliver bullets to ya door like them domino pies nigga
Say hello to my little friend like Scarface
I pull that fuckin' rifle right out the guitar case
Dipset, the best out, Hell Rell, he fresh out
Jones the kuffe smacker, he bringing them techs out
Sporty-style, 40 cal, he bringing Corvettes out
Bezel, the beast but I still show you what fresh 'bout
You know who shavin' the grams, 40k on the hand
Killa nigga, what more can I say about Cam
J.R. the writer of writers and Santana
Back like cooked crack, he even supplying suppliers
The type that I'm tighter, tight 'cause I'm writer
Write 'cause I'm nicer, site for the lifers
Knifes in the cipher, writers a viper, listen this is butter
Even ringling brothers see I got the eye of the tiger
Before I met killa cam, I was dealing killa grams
I mean killer grams, throws a tan, fill a pan
Recorded in the hole, where you couldn't chill or stand
No booth, microphone hangin off the ceiling fan
Mass million fan sittin' in the Belly Hilton
Watch how I heavy kills him, Bessey, Chevy, Desi fill 'em
But I still ain't break a sweat, yes I'm chillin'
Veet wong, seat wrong, Tito gonna bet the building
I been grind to lean, sniff lines for fiends
Grams chopped, tan rock, I pitch lima beans
Piff grind was mean, had 'em dumb stuck
So when I say uncut, I don't mean behind the scenes
Dipset, the best out, Hell Rell, he fresh out
Jones the kuffe smacker, he bringing them techs out
Sporty-style, 40 cal, he bringing Corvettes out
Bezel, the beast but I still show you what fresh 'bout
You know who shavin' the grams, 40k on the hand
Killa nigga, what more can I say about Cam
J.R. the writer of writers and Santana
Back like cooked crack, he even supplying suppliers
Yo, I'm a NY G like Jeremy Shockey
Come through drop my coupe like I meant to be sloppy
I got DJ's kickin' karate
'Cause they throw my wax on and take your wax off like Mr. Myagi
Pimpin', I'm cocky, I slap your broad on the cheek
And send her home barefooted, you massaging her feet
You probably go down on a freak, you're hardly a meat
But we ain't mad 'cause you're proving, you are what you eat
Your squadron is weak, speak and get a broken something
Need a plate in ya grill like a toaster oven
Fuck it, they even got dojas frontin'
Shakin' your cola, only time your coke was bubbling cousin
Cal get weight with no problemo
Ride around ya block, sell it out the car window
And ya mom's been know, that I chop rocks
That make your father cop like Carl Winslow
Dipset, the best out, Hell Rell, he fresh out
Jones the kuffe smacker, he bringing them techs out
Sporty-style, 40 cal, he bringing Corvettes out
Bezel, the beast but I still show you what fresh 'bout
You know who shavin' the grams, 40k on the hand
Killa nigga, what more can I say about Cam
J.R. the writer of writers and Santana
Back like cooked crack, he even supplying suppliers

[Intro: Fab]
Yeah, yeah,
them niggas just talkin baby, (dont listen to that shit)
dont mind them they just talkin baby
they know they cant fuck with me baby (that mean they cant fuck wit you)
you tell them like that bitch told scarface (what she say?)
I dont fuck with help
[Verse 1 - Fab]
They say they out for dead presidents never respect it,
First of all ben franklin was never elected,
that mean them and big bills have never connected,
they just say it cause they think it sound clever on records,
Secondly, gods first, should never be second,
and if youre livin' wrong, money can never correct it
I'ma say it once, and its whoever directed,
you'll never get off on me, I'm never the exit
All black everything in my black V
it aint a game and if it was itd be a black Wii
I'm on mah A game, never on that B shit, you on that B shit, never gone be shit.
Thats how I see C shit cause I am D shit, true story like that hollywood E shit,
I say F niggas cause I'm on some G shit, yeah that red and green stripe double g shit.
That was for mah homie, just know I'm thinkin of you
I told him "stay on top, so they can't get above you" (nice)
He told me "I dig that", like a fuckin shovel
Why it take a nigga to go to jail to say he love you?
We be killin em boy we be killin em,
damn, we used to dream of half a million,
Now the family get money like Will and 'em
accounts rise like we fillin' them with hellium
My baby girl got ass its not secret that is
make you look away, and still be peekin' at it
She say "they come with painted faces tryna clown on you,
how they under you but tryna talk down on you?"
You see a rat is gon be that and go for any cheddar
Tell my bitch that I'm no good as if they any better
But her loyalty keep her from them otha boys
Let em holla she just gon' exist above the noise
[Verse 2 - Paul Cain]
Paul Gasol alike, a nigga with the swag of Yao Ming balla type but more Rich Porter type, a small giant, nigga we not at all alike, the shit you just discoverin I been doin all my life.
Y'all niggas call it ballin', I just call it life, I'm still the same as day 1 I dont get caught in all the hype.
So wussup Dash? I can't call ha Ike I guess they don't see Paul all they see is all the ice.
Yellow everything lemon and sour jewels rich head to toe wavy ay the fly Howard Hughes
Enjoy the best of everything we paid our dues, so niggas wanna jump ship and join our crews.
But this aint no joy ride when my boys ride somewhere somebody boy died and never will your boy hide
I'm on frontline no matter how drastic, but otherwise you can find me where the cash is in love with the rapids, no I dont mean white water raftin', I'm talkin bout them 4 door Astons,
Addicted to fashion, diamonds, flashin',but the money music and fast cars is my passion,
I'm no newbie, nor am I a has been these whack rappers give me headaches this just the asprin
I often speak through my actions, but paint pictures with words that you can close your eyes and imagine.

Montana
That Untouchable Empire baby, Coke Boy

So lay down, Bad Boy, Blood Line
Get up, talk to 'em
I got tats all on my arm,
Racks on racks in the bank
Forgiatos on my Range, Pepsi blue my paint
All these girls be choosy,
Can't find a bitch who ain't
Haters they out ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' wit my whole crew, ball
Hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, ball
Make it rain we don't give a fuck
'Bout what you say, I do this every day
Don't buy bottles, buy bottle case
Seem like every night my birthday
I can't help but get the cake
Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Live it up and just for fallin' out
What you say? I do this err'day,

Do this err'day, do this err'day
Tattoos on my neck, half a mill in my car
Dream team I rap, just me and my dogs
Straight cash in that haircut
Sea Bass and that lamp chop
Met her at the bar
Tryin' to get some head shots
62 that Maybach, fake jewels don't play that
Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6
Never hit that red zone, baby I was airborne
Hoppin' out that Ghost
Sippin' red dot with a red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population
And I'm never fakin' Jacks,
You know I'm poppin' Aces
I'mma ball, Illuminati bank rolls
Suicidal Lan' doors, and two Italian tan hoes
What you say? I do this err'day,
Wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err day, do this err day,

What you say? I do this err'day,

Do this err'day, do this err'day
Do this err'day, do this err'day
Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Time is callin'
I'm flyin' around and I'm gettin' it
Like 90thou in my denim
Told a bitch I just met,
Write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi,
Got these niggas buyin' large lead
Bout to take my LA crib
And drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game,
Like Peach Ciroc and champagne
You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets,
And I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes
This passion and pain fashion,
Matchin' my things catchin'
Action from things mackin',
Then flashin' my rings captain
Twin V's, thin tires, envy my entire
Catalogue, but don't have the heart
'Cause real kings build empires
Everything that I said nigga
Was everything that you saw
I did everything that I claim,
You ain't like us 'cause we ball
What you say? I do this err'day,
Wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err day, do this err day,
Do this err day, do this err day
What you say? I do this err'day,
Wh-wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err'day, do this err'day
Do this err'day, do this err'day
Feel like I was born for ballin' out

Money in the hand doin' it so brand-o
Bring her to an island let her piece it out
Lovin' my gangster tatted out
[Chorus]
Let it be known I'm the boss

They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the sh-t thats been thrown at me
or am I just a little snappy
and they genuinly care
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and I continuosly stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
what the f-ck good does that do me now
but somehow I know you're near me in presence
or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this
but Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many f-cking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if its true, how the f-ck am I supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds
Doody, thats what we call eachother
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about eachothers skin colours
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
when I look over and his shirt is off
I'm like you gon fry and like
"No I wont, I'm black stupid
black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn"
meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
like I'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
and I still have to get you back for that sh-t
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well Nate finally got em back sh-t
it must have been at least 16 years ago
well I put em in your cask-owww
moving past it, it still aint registered yet
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
the motor city mo-town
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds
and this may sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
and as for all of me and D12 we feel like f-ck rap
it feels like our General just f-cking died in our lap
we shut off all our pages,
all our cell numbers is changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you aint
purple gang, you gotta pressing on
don't ever give up the dream dog
I got love for you all
and Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on Dresden
from making cars to paintballing
getting arrested
to sitting across from eachother in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating
me, you and whats his face
I forgot his f-cking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the f-cking face
and thats on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds

I stay alone, skipped a stone, from the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tires, getting even
And for a while, I made you smile, saw the voodoo in you child
Girl, you know you are the reason
It's been a wild season
It's been a wild season
It's been a wild season
And the hunting never stops
'Till everybody drops
I used to drink Old English and speak broken English
The kiki this Venus said she is in love with my penis
Every evening she was living to see them, until I see them
Yeah, men are from Mars, and girls are from Venus
Life's no games - I used to drink until my brain blanked
Insane for kane talking faster than a man'd think
I spent millions on friends who didn't love me
The image in my mirror of life appeared ugly
Self-entropy drove me cold like a winter breeze
Fear as a winter tree, yeah I wasted centuries
Running wild, then the birth of my child struck me
Realisation, I learnt how to smile, wow
What I know now, I wish I knew then
I may have had a clue of what to do then
I may have gotten out of these bad situations
Running around town with no destination
I stay alone, skipped a stone, from the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tyres, getting even
And for a while, I made you smile, saw the voodoo in you child
Girl, you know you are the reason
It's been a wild season
Seems I made it this far
(It's been a wild season)
Seems I made it this far
(It's been a wild season)
You asked me how did I get home
Where'd you get those bruises from?
You left your shoes, can't find your phone
You didn't sleep here on your own
What did you do? Where did you go?
Truth is I don't really know
Oh, is this love? It's not enough
Just one sip and I can't stop
I'm too far out, too far to reach
From below you call to me
Don't get too close, I'm flying high
I feel too beautiful to die
Let me tear, oh I don't care
See the horror in your stare
Watch me spin, oh watch me run
Watch me burn up in the sun
It's been a wild season
I stay alone, skipped a stone, from the known to the unknown
Feeding fires, spinning tyres, getting even
And for a while, I made you smile, saw the voodoo in you child
Girl, you know you are the reason
It's been a wild season
I know the reasons not to break your heart
It's been a wild season
I know the reasons still I stray too far
It's been a wild season
Made me realise
It's been a wild season
Made me realise
It's been a wild season
Seems I made it this far (Yeah, still got that wolf in me)
It's been a wild season (2016)
And the hunting never stops (and we still on the prowl)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days
[Verse 2: Babeo Baggins]
I stopped my rambling
Never been once a gambler, my town
But for you, for you, for you, just once
It might be fine these days
These days
[Verse 3: Drake]
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think about how I have failed to change all of my ways, ohh
These days
[Verse 4: Both]
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days
[Verse 5: Babeo Baggins & Drake]
I've had lovers
I've had lovers, one after another
But this time, me, myself and I are just fine
These days
These days
[Verse 6: Drake]
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars these days
These days

LAY HIM DOWN
Listen Girl
I ain't afraid to tell a man just what I want and what I need

And as we go our juices flow we scream again, scream again
Let me do the things I want with you in here
Girlfriend
(Chorus:)
Let's lay him down
'Round and 'round

'Round and 'round
Come give me that
Come give me that
Come give me your shh...
There ain't no need to tell nobody what we want
So we don't need to flaunt when we're done
Innerbitions go when we let go just let the flow take you
Where no one needs to know
When we're alone maybe I'ma take you 'till the break of dawn
When we are alone
Come give me that
Come give me that
Come give me your body baby
(Repeat Chorus)
There ain't no need to tell nobody what we want
I ain't afraid
Let me do the things I want with you in here

No one needs to know
Come give me that
Come give me that
Come give me your body
I know
Come give me that
Come give me that
Come give me your shh...

When we are alone
Come give me that
Come give me that
Come give me your shh...

Okay, it's the emcee extraordinaire Talib Kweli
Chillin' on Soundbombing 3 with my people's
From the East, Cypha Soundz, from West, Mr. Choc
This is how we do it, I got y'all back, y'all got mine
Let's do this, no more music motherfuckers
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yo, fly in it
Blue skies the limit, the skies infinite
It reflect in the eyes of those who try to send spies in it
Capture the sun if they could, but they go blind by it
Look in the sky and I see Africa's eyes in it
The land is dry like the cry infinite
The tear we shed grow to fruit til' the eye replenish
The industry wanna try to give my rhyme a sentence
Behind bars with my rhymes diminished, they tryna end us
But all them clowns do is give my mind a senate
To watch my people's enemy die in my presence
Fly away on the highest adventure out on the line
And enter the gate of Zion, need to decide who sent em'
I went through the jungle
(Yeah)
Stalking like a black panther, rap's answer to that cancer
Choking the life out the hood
They won't let a man emancipate his people
This refreshing like the spray of the bay in Puerto Rico
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
All the things you desire
Earth, wind, water, fire
These elements hammer nice together
See, you can find it there
Find it there
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yo, I came into this world as the naked truth
A little baby girl trying to make it through
Through this earth, wind, fire and water
That I'm someone's daughter, cadence of divine order
Sorta sent to let the people know their times spent
It's precious and we can't keep our minds bent
On just the pleasures of sex, drugs, wine, bread
In essence, we one with the environment
Though I've been here, less than a year
Being so close to God, I guess I haven't learned the fear
When I heard nature telling me, time to come home
Told my mind this is the path for you to walk, not to run on
Understand the night to reach a higher day
Follow yourself so you can fly away
(Fly away)
Fly away dawg, fly away dawg, fly away dawg, fly away dawg
You are feeling the stress
But in life you're truly blessed
Go for nothing less
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away
Go for nothing less
Go for nothing less
Go for nothing less

[1st Verse:]
It's been a struggle for me,
wonderin why I can't get by with my life,
but now I'm free,
and I done did some right and wrong,
but still I seen the light,
and I done been around the sex and drugs,
hustlin but mama aint raise no thug,
and it took a little to see how real it could get,
and how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I,
see a lot of bad things on my block,
but I aint tryna be a victim of a gunshot,
I can't let them hold me down
[Chorus:]
See all the things I heard about,
see all the things I've read about,
I seen the light
[2nd Verse:]
It's kinda hard for me,
to stay away from all these girls and the haters they don't like,
that I'm fufillin my dream,
but I'm just tryna do my thing,
my nigga can't I live my life,
I got the world on my shoulders (shoulders),
and I'm only gettin older (older),
but it's like it's gettin colder,
I'm gone make it but I can't take it sometimes,
I came a long way from my block,
and I'm grateful for everything I got,
I didn't let nothin bring me down
[Chorus]
See all the things I heard about,
see all the things I've read about,
I seen the light
[Rap:]
Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a rightous spirit,
they try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it,
mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics,
a large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it,
like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it
really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder,
a current was occurin it was stirrin up my hunger,
but I couldn't let the shit burry a nigga under,
use to cry hopin all of this would pass,
and then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass,
a part of my swagga but apparently I won,
I took my shades off and now I'm starin at the sun,
I'm seein the light I'm seein the light,
realizin that it's me in the light,
I read about it read about it now I know it
I coulda did wrong,
I seen a lot of people hustle,
but I left them things alone,
I almost lost my friend to the struggle,
but I guess that made me strong,
made me strong,
I seen a whole lot of drama,
and it taught me how to fight,
taught me how to fight,
and I thank God for my mama,
she showed me what was right,
I coulda been in the dark,
but thank God for the light,
(I seen the light) I seen the light
[End adlibs:]
all the things I heard about,
I read about it I read about it oh,
I seen the light I seen the light
Mmm

Baby you know you got me going crazy
You run around my head like these waves
Yeah, baby you
You know that you the one that I adore
The one I introduce to Tom Ford at dinner
That was you
You'se the one I fell in love with
The one I move these drugs with
But now you on some fuck shit
Anybody but you
I ain't figured it that you would be the one to cut me
Leave me on the floor fucking bloody, Goddamn
Baby you, you had me fooled the whole time
Now you got me in King of Diamonds giving these hoes time
Girl, baby you
I can't blame you though
When you see the door, you see the door
Now listen, baby you
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no
But baby you, you got me going
But you got me going, you got me going
But you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh
Tell me how you think we living how we live?
Like you the one that put us in these cribs
Not me but baby you
Like I ain't getting money for these shows
I guess you think I'm tripping on these hoes
They fans but look at you
Who in them Celine bags? Who in them Giuseppes?
Louboutins, wanna bet me? I win 'cause it's you
You begged me to get on that show
I ain't want it but you did
I'm a real nigga I did it for you
You don't see Swizz and Alicia
Kim K and Kanye arguing all the time
It's just you
I begged you to marry me
Half a million dollars out my safe down the drain
But fuck it 'cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it something we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singing shit about you
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one make me feel unsatisfied, no
But baby you, you got me going
But you got me going, you got me going
But you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh

It, uh, needs, it just needs that, uh, that uh, yeah
Yeah, okay (oh, ooh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
And ya say hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now, hold out)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire
Baby, we can dance if you like
Shake that pretty ass on the flash of the light
Off of one glass, can only imagine the hype
Trying to figure how to be in your plans for the night
'Cause I haven't felt this good in weeks
Got a fresh cut now I'm looking for the freaks
Fresh car wash, please don't put your hand on the Jeep
Use your etiquette, and bring sand to the beach, but
All around the world they keep running
Shawty wanna hold my hand, it ain't nothing
Mariah said if it's worth time, then say something
And they tell me I'm out of my mind, I ain't budging
Yep, sorry if I'm so overzealous
'Cause I haven't felt no energy like you on this planet
So yeah, so put your number in my hand
And then fill that bitch up with fan mail, you diggin'? (ooh, yeah)
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now, hold out)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on and)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire
Really good, nice to meet ya
Maybe we could smoke a little Indonesia
Shake up the world like a GOC
Your love song so strong you don't need no features, no
Little Jimmy, let's park at last
'Cause cupid never hit me in my heart that fast
I watch you burn whoever start that gas to walk a little bit
You're either gonna park or crash, it's muscle memory
Walking down a similar path, I feel the energy
Or maybe it's the way that I'm feeling from all this Hennessy
I'm way, way bigger than what they tend to be
And you could be my Marilyn Monroe, I'm John Kennedy, you know it
You feel it
'Cause I haven't felt this rhythm in a minute, get it fit
Till we fall, got arches, so I hit it with springs
I'ma fall, if I want it I'ma get it (ooh, yeah)
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now, hold out)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire
Now I could turn a pussy to a kitty pool
And I could swim around until my fingers prune
But if you stick around, I'll probably sing it to 'em
Yeah, if you stick around, I'll probably roll another up right now
Can a nigga grove? (oh yeah) come on
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire
Smoke that fire

This is a you A rhyme dedicate to the ca nine
Come here boy I said it's play time
It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie
I don't want to be a freak but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself and I close it right
In your face now you want to taste my food what?
You got your own food get a attitude
You get left call the ref if you think it's foul
I ain't tryin' to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile
Cause after awhile, I'ma want to get Buckwild
And now months laters, I'ma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin
Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin'
Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces
Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces
That's how I'm livin', just like a rottweiler
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem
And when I can't bear em, I share em
You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd, but we've got bush
So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a you-Haul
Forget the grindin' shit, I ain't tryin' to get the blue ball
Brap bump me child, I'm speakin' upon the nitty gritty
I'm a dog, here Kitty Kitty
Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day
Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way
I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper
Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker
So come one friend, come two friend, come all
United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall
In your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very
Thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry
Tom and Jerry (what?) A Woody Woodpecker
You need body work, I work that body, I'm a body wrecker
Inter-sector, I'm the nectar plus the plum
I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb
If you got some, just an eensy bit of game
Then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame
I shoot, aim the same game, yo obediently
Tell em that I get the drawers come off immediately
Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut
And be that I'm a mutt so what?
No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to
It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin'
Down the street, watchin' ladies
Nobody's watchin' you, because you got a baby
I ain't tryin' to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
A new flower, so Joe can take a shower
And get wet, and then jet
Like ah, seven-forty-seven
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm steppin', so when they call me, you'll hear
"Is Common there?" Uh-uh, sorry
You got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Choppin' down the cherry tree and never comin' back
It's like that and it'll be like that
Because a dog is a woman's best friend black

Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh (boy I thought you knew)
You can just do the god damn! (straight from New York Cityyyyy)
(New York Cityyyyyyy)
C'mon! (I'ma tell you like this man)
(Blastin off with the big dog)
Yeahhhh, just do it! (I feels, Funkmaster, if it ain't his it ain't shit)
C'mon, just do it (You know?)
(Volume III)
Yeahhhh, just do it! (We're all the way live, boyyyyy)
C'mon, just do it (You got your mad dogs, you got your pissed dogs)
C'mon c'mon, just do it (and then you got your big dogs)
Yeah, yeah (like Funkmaster Flex)

[Intro - Akon (P.Diddy) {Ludacris}]
Chyeah!
It's that incredible sh-- (Talk to 'em)
There's too many beautiful ladies in this house tonight, Felli
I think we need to hit em off something proper, son {Okay... whoo!}
(They call me Diddy, DJ Felli Fel!)
Testing, one, two, three (Testing, one, two, three
Hey, listen to me, listen, hey)
[Verse One - P.Diddy]
It's tricky, I'm picky, baby, but I just spotted you
Doing your thing, G-string, shoe string point of view
Lend me your body, you got me in a zone
Bet a million in a half cash i can make you explode
You don't wanna brave the cold, you wanna Diddy Combs
I can take you on outer limits away from home
(?) ..... (?)
In the middle of the club doin' a rodeo show
The hoes seem skeemy, wet dreamy
Emphasism obsessed gleemy
(Incredible sex) You need me
You can ease me, please me baby
I maybe am little crazy but in a way...
[Hook - Akon (DJ Felli Fel)]
Don't make me get buck in here!
Shawty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
But all I need is a one night scandal
And I'ma get buck in here!
Damn, lil mama, know you fit my standards
You the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' that grandam
(While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
Just shake that thang, shake that thang)
[Verse Two - Ludacris]
She can make it clap like a standing OVATION
Spin like my record at your radio STATION
Feel the SENSATION, I put it right there
They be like "Luda!", I be like "Y-yeah!",
You like it like that, don't ya baby
The flow's insane, and the stroke is crazy
I stroke so good, like Tiger Woods
And i RAWR, like a tiger would
My livelihood is not Hollywood
I'm still Southside Atlanta, that's a lively hood
A circus, big top, like Ringling Brothers
If you wanna learn something, bring your mothers
Sit back and observe, invite some friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin
Felli on the cell-y with a couple of twins
Cause tonight, damn right, we gonna do it again
[Hook]
[P.Diddy] Aiyyo, Felli let me one more time
[Verse Three - P.Diddy]
Listen, women, lace them, G-force jets, fly 'em
Twisted, crooked, cell phone numbers, probably
Flip em change em, prissy and bouji, the hood (?)
Game of taste em, trissy's I'm runnin' em good (?)
Leather or silk, I melt them all
Love em, leave em, give em hell for sure
Tell them words they minds and souls deserve
Or give them things they might prefer
Sandrio pan, mandarin sweet massage oil
Pimp, gamein', grants, and benz' i tried em
Used to style em, now just virgin island
Kamasutra freaky...
[Hook - Up to "grandam"]
[Outro - Lil Jon]
Hold up, fuck that shit, fuck that shit! (yoyoyoyoyoyoyo...)
It's your boy, Lil Jon! (YEAH!)
Time to take this mothafucker to another level! (Let's go!)
Get your mothafucking hands up!
Get your mothafucking hands up!
Throw your mothafucking drinks up!
Throw your mothafucking drinks up!
Now get buck in this bitch!
Get buck in this bitch!
Get buck in this bitch!
Get buck in this bitch!
Get crunk in this bitch!
Get crunk in this bitch!
Get crunk in this bitch!
Get crunk in this bitch!
YEAH!
[P.Diddy] Aiyyo, Felli, you a fool for that one. HA

[Chamillionaire]
See your rhyme's the kinda rhyme, that's flooded with punch lines
My rhyme's the kinda rhyme, that make niggas punch nine
One what dum-dum, the police gotta come down
And keep the kids from crying, too late cause you done dying
Raps dying without me, I need to breathe some breath in it
It seems like it's a shortage, of real niggas left in it
Ain't no if's and's or but's, somebody is deaf in it
The game got a lot of rappers, but I am the best in it nigga move
[Hook]
Fake niggas step aside, cause them real niggas coming through
You can try to stop my shine, but there is nothing you can do-oo
We ready, we ready for you
So respect my hustle my struggle, my mind and my grind
I can make it to the top, when they was saying I would lose
Now I got my middle finger, talking back to you
I done paid my dues, to get me respect where it's due
So respect my hustle my struggle, my mind and my grind
[Chamillionaire]
Gotta grind, gotta stay on my grind
If your scheme ain't bout green, your transaction get declined
If your scheme ain't bout green, I forgot it nevermind
If your team ain't my team, get in line and get behind
I'm next up in line, headed up there with Jay-Z and them
Big E and Em-inem, and I can't even swim
But ain't too many niggas I know, that go as deep as them
And me uh-um freestyle, naw I don't need a pen It's me your kin*, the one major labels love to call
Got Chamillionaire on the line did you get him, naw
Yep I kept with it, the rapper got slept with it
Said my mixtapes was cool, and my album had no depth in it
Niggas criticizing Koopa, now Koopa addressing it
Stop crying playa, go get a dress and go dress in it
Or put your money against my uppercut punch, and let's win it
Your right eye swollen shut, and your left get left squinted Koopa
[Hook]
[Paul Wall]
I'm the people's champ, you the people's chump
You talking BFI trash, but you still a punk
I'm on the road to success, and I'm ready to drive
I'm in the fast lane, you still trying to catch a ride
I heard it through the grapevine, you been talking down
But you be riding my dick, soon as I come around
I know you see me shining, I know it hurts your heart
I'm one hundred percent, I've been it from the start
I always kept it real, you always kept it fake
I always showed love, you always showed hate
You think the game owe you, but you ain't got a clue
If you be good to the game, it'll be good to you
You claiming that you real, but you like a piece of glass
I can see through your lies, you falling off fast
You trying to sprint as fast as you can, the whole race
But you'd be better off, keeping at a steady pace stay in ya place
[Hook]

Oooh
If i only ever knew I'm trapped in my mind and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
And so are you
Oooh
If i only ever knew so are you if we only ever knew
We're trapped in our minds and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
If we only ever knew
Here we come with the roughest and toughest high grade sensimilla pumping through our lungs and veins
Never gonna stop till the end of our days
Setting up sound systems with bass for your face
Console shooting out frequency
Full of loops and beats and symmetry
The rooms getting filled with chemistry
Let it be do you see all the energy
So we keep on moving at a rocksteady pace
We know you gonna want it if you have a little taste
Loosen up your neck and your back and your waist
Feel your self lift as you float into space
Twisting your mind so quickly
Sonically and telepathically
We're kissing goodbye to the gravity
Let it be do you feel all the energy
I said oooh
If i only ever knew I'm trapped in my mind and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
If i only ever knew so are you if we only ever knew
And so are you
Oooh
If we only ever knew we're trapped in our minds and trapped in a zoo
If we only ever knew
Western youth be in trouble cos they're not playing rough
So i try to start a fire with a riddim that's tough
We need a revolution but we can't get enough
Of youtube facebook instagram and that stuff
We need some social activity
Physically in this reality
There's too much digital calamity
Let us be what we need for prosperity
But we keep on using up more than we need
And we build on slavery power and greed
And i weep every time that i watch TV
So i focus on my Jing and my Shen and my Chi
Soaking up pure infinity
Kundalini shakti for energy
We're kissing goodbye to negativity
Let it be just free your mentality
I said oooh
If i only ever knew I'm trapped in my mind and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
If i only ever knew
So are you
Oooh
If we only ever knew we're trapped in our minds and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
If we only ever knew
We are all chosen
We are all golden
We are all chosen
We are all golden
Right
We are all chosen
We are all golden
Allright
We are all chosen
We are all golden
You know
We are all chosen
We are all golden
One more time
We are all chosen
We are all golden
Oooh
If I only ever knew we're trapped in our minds and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
Oooh
If we only ever knew we're trapped in our minds and trapped in a zoo
Oooh
Oooh
If we only ever knew

Tell me do you want to go home?

Me sirve a mi o va pa'l carajo. Oye, revolucion compadre!"
In the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
MC's in the game running for the status
Take a few seconds to review the crews
Sitting on top is the Hill looking over you
Killa Hill Niggas, cream in my dream
Cooking up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is
Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleeping with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be coming to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!
Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence, crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-you niggas talking fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seeking, son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speaking, wild as Indians
Tomahawk, Shaoling slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports
What you thought?
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
That that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Words drop in chant, the cheeky-eyed slant
I'm taking these cannabis plants yo for grant'
Exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Coming out the dime piece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashing your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surrounding me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not fronting or bragging, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
That that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
That that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back,
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger

Yeah! Ha! Yeah, we got, come on
Why y'all cats know the abstract nigga with the attitude
Pass the booze, and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no mo' but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom
Stepping to the A.M., cats be taking in the P.M.
Tell the players I'm the G.M.
Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them
See the streets is bleeding
Had to meet with my mind on how I could divined
Stay on my climb
I'm grinding, 'til I get blue balls
Everyday, same shit new star
Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall
There's a place that to run from it if you neutral
Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go into a thrift shop
Connect, get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gonna get that kick-a-box
Make sure that bitch knock
If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot
Hip Hop is changing, why y'all want me to stay the same?
Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Hey yo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell
With the fan and the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberland's
I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light
I'm trying to do better
I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweaking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

In a smoky room, I see you
And you're dancin' to a groovin' tune
Just mellow out, shake your, mmm
And do your thang, baby do your thang
You gotta blonde, a redhead, a brunette
In the gym working up a sweat
One on the treadmill, one on the bike
One in kickboxing class all night
Doing their best to work it out
Tryin' to get a nice body and a nice "Badow"
You love to hear words comin' out of their mouths
These girls are G.R.I.T.S., 'Girls Raised In The South'
Gonna get cleaned up, meet at the spot
Each one is confident she's pretty hot
Hate to see them go but you love to watch them leave
Go on ladies just do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
The witching hour and the club is packed
And we're doing it and we're doing it fast
The lights are bright, cocktails strong
Just do your thang, baby do your thang
Man look at that face, silhouette body
Kickin' so hard you thought she knew karate
Send a 'Thank you' to her dad and mom
'Cause once she smiles boy you know what's on
You know she has nice etiquette
But she'll laugh even though she doesn't get it yet
You want to hear her say no one can do it better
Next she's callin' out the 15th letter
Better recognize, get woke to some act rights
She'll get to the point like stalagmites
Bouncin' in the club in the black light
Girl so fine bow down like a jack-knife
She ain't frontin', she ain't stuntin'
Swingin' for the fence boy, she ain't buntin'
She's educated but she's fluent in street slang
Go on girl, just do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang
Do your thang, baby do your thang

[Intro: girl]
It's all right -- yyyyeaaaaaaaaah!
[Ghostface Killah]
Hold up, gots to boost those tray ups
Think I'm playin' pa, reach and get glazed up
Face all sprayed up, on the floors
The left side of your cheek, go ahead and pick that face up
Of course I'mma fuck with ya'll niggas, ya'll pussy (yeah)
Ya'll niggas know how Pretty Toney get down
Made The Post in '98, fuck an album, when I need CREAM
It's on, nigga, faggots, better check out their accountants
When I hung around broke niggas, and broke bitches
You know what that means, it equals no riches and
I can't have that, I got a lot of wiz'es
They spoiled, told 'em they don't have to move drizzers
Whatever they see, is none of they business
I do what I do, to get that spinach
Whether it's kill 'em, spray 'em, play 'em, all on the streets
I weigh 'em, saute 'em, Ghost and Kay Slay 'em
[Chorus 2X: Ghostface Killah]
This kid about his papers, paychecks
Thinkin' you can pay me now, any bear feelings, just say it
Go 'head brother, just as fast as you front
It be an honor just to lay you down
[Trife Da God]
The first check I ever got
Son I spent it up top, blowin' a cop, cop, cop, cop, cop...
I had 2 Cent, plus my car fare home
It wasn't even Broadway until I got those stones
I was sixteen, shit, I barely knew what a gram was
Studied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was
To get that CREAM, and serve them fiends
Around the same time my nigga Buck converged with Beans
Two way team, posted up on the benches
Wit a magnet for a stash, that I kept hid under the black fences
Jakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles
I was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little
Though they switched nickels on niggas, and pointed out bitches
In the precinct got the snitchin', so they hit 'em off with something decent
Avoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin'
On point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'
[Ghostface Killah]
Faggot ass niggas, when I ride get the fuck out the way
When I see jewels, all I know is take
I'm like a seed at a birthday party, all I want is cake
In other words, papes, sellin' herbs and tapes
Movin' birds and weight, through suburban states
God damn it, I told ya'll niggas
This is a Theodore stickup
Wake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!
[Chorus 2X]
[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, you heard what the bitch said
When we wasn't makin' too much muthafuckin' CREAM and shit
We was beatin' the shit out of niggas
Takin' their little Summer Youth shit
Buyin' beer and weed and shit
Shakin' niggas upside down on some cartoon shit
Change fall all out of their pockets and shit
Yellin' and tellin' the cops, fuck ya'll niggas!
This is Theodore, bitch

It's never too much
Yearning your touch
Oh, oh, oh
French pedicure in the air
It's plain to see that you like em there
Love is beautiful
Also physical
[Verse 1]
I been thinking of ways to make you fantasize about me
I been thinking of moves
The pressure I put upon your body
When I demonstrate girl you're extremely over excited
But don't hyperventilate just relax
Please baby, invite it
All the faces you make when I'm off in it
Got me pulling your hair, girl, let's get ignorant
Ain't nobody goin' freak you like you know I can
Your swagger, your style, girl when you smile
And I grab your legs
And your
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm digging you out
I'm hitting the spots you like best
You're tempted to scream
You're digging your nails in my back
I'm feeling your passion
Watching you curl your toes
Shaking, convulsing
Want you to let go
Let this moment take you on a fantasy voyage
Your temperature's rising as I go downtown
Just when you think it's over
Here comes another round
The prettiest girl anybody's ever seen
Your swagger, your style, girl when you smile
And I grab your legs
And your
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
It is going down
I'm loving your stroking bed
It's rocking like we're on the ocean
Another round
I'ma show you some of my tricks
While you're holding my blue stick
Do you like that?
Flowers, candy, chocolates, violins, and wine
Did you have a good time?
All that
If you're ready just lay back
I'll be kissing your thighs
Loving your smile
When I grab your legs
[Chorus]
If it's feeling good
Let me hear you say
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

[Vast Aire]
I know cats are on some shit
But we about to elevate right now
Bout to scream Phoenix. . .
[Vordul]
Mega, Allah's stars seen only afar
The physical of ma chosen, my craft is balls
We rebels righteous, and stand and scowl in the heightness
Rep life, graf artists and ghetto writers united
Starvin' with one table and no mic
And still get it on bombin' and flow nice
Spit vomit and throw dice
Taking chances with life trying to get by
And stop all the time trying to get high
Gotta clear mind and stay focused, avoid serpents
And worship life, we like merchants
Street peasants with these lessons
Live, build, and pass away, and keep stressin'
Thinking how we gonna master days
With passion, that's why we rap this way
From Manhattan 115 to 135
We pigeons became phoenix with open mind
To open yours, flow the raw innovative
Phoenix
[chorus]
so when you see me shine light (better scream phoenix)
the god locked in a cell (scream phoenix)
moms can't post bail (you gotta scream phoenix)
Jsus on a crucifix (scream phoenix)
Jsus on a crucifix (scream phoenix)
Jsus on a crucifix
[Vast Aire]
Yo, birds of the same flock together
Congested on a majestic * cuts off * no! no! no!
My feathers and flames are one skin
Hallowed be Thy name in the beginning there was no sin
We in the ninth inning, and I'm God body trying to win
Flying against the wind
But now my shell is weightless and fireproof
But the truth is I'm proof of living fire
I'm not made of organics, not even wires
Just felt my body light up and hurt the choir
See to the common fowl the phoenix is Sire
Most high of all things to ever have wings
Existence is struggle, resistance is futile
Meanwhile we now possess the power of ten suns
To transcend and elevate into one
Famine, disease and senseless dieing is done
Pigeon bird got a breath left
Heart beat no more
Phoenix bird morph and we live off the G-force
[chorus]
scream phoenix
the god locked in a cell (scream phoenix)
moms can't post bail (scream phoenix)
Jsus on the crucifix (scream phoenix)

i almost didn't make it,
my ...for famous,
the fifteenth of december, born into this cold world,
..having me in the bathroom,
surprised that i will survive...
but in the toilet...
momma passing out, just to cut me the umbilical!
...
who would have thought ...
came from a different ... my... is the boss.
now i'm looking at the world from a different view,
fake, try to...
now, what you're crying sis? ...
chorus:
i'm so far... since i was born,
i've been that baby!
who wouldn't know ... no one can save me!
these flashing lights got hold of me, isn't that crazy,
but here i am, you can't be mad,
cause you won't make me who i am!
now remind me a little,
i remember the time when i was only twelve
the only thing on my mind making it big,
rocking.. i lost confidence...
.. and being dr. dre.
never knowing all along that my father was dre.
we took a dna just to try to prove it,
speechless, i could have been the son of a music
icon? get that?
now it's official... wide opened
.. it's the issues,
a former nobody, nowadays a celeb,
but i am not gonna use the talent to...
i hear them talking, i feel like i'm the man now,
tmc got me on the .. plan now!
drop a bomb, let 'em hit what i can't do,...
chorus:
so check the dna, i'm...
west coast smiling me...
doped like a pharmacist, high in the clouds...
.. but the paparazzi watching,...
delight of a legend, and i ain't slowing down,
...the cop...
but i ain't paying.. locked down...
..the city is my witnesses!
so let the beat bang, and pass the crown over, ...
chorus:

Ya'll wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick, never seen a crackhouse
Wanna a war with the Don have your techs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta
Yo, yo, I stand alone in this cold world, could you believe that?
I've seen some good men get blown over G-packs
In the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
And live niggaz get it on with the D-techs
Shit, my life's legendary
If I wrote it all down in a book it would be very scary
What you know 16 BM'ers and Benzes
Rope chains down to my dick, the beef looks tremendous
Me and my niggaz flip holes in bitches
Back then, when I wouldn't even pose for bitches
A-YO, you can ask Dapper Dan, who was the man?
Back in 88, every other week tricked 30 grand
Even my bitches wore Gucci and Louie
My peeps already in the crowd lookin' for groupies to screw me
Exit the club, about to cruise up the block now
With the Taj, stay frontin' with top down
See me in that new thing with my fiancee
Ass so fat, makin' you say, "Muchos Grande"
Don't blame me, blame them, the white folk
For givin' me ten mil, for possessin' the tight flow, whoa
Ya'll wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick, never seen a crackhouse
Wanna a war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta
Ya'll wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick, never seen a crackhouse
Wanna a war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta
Blow half your head off, leave you with brain damage
He got his shit rocked 'cause he didn't pay homage
It's the Don of this rap shit, go on with that wack shit
Heard you walked the dorm in a thong on your last bid
Joey Crack is, the most official
Toke the pistol for those who oppose the issue
I hope I convinced you to back up, really you acted up
Believe me I could easily get your ass touched
And that sucks, ain't nobody fuckin' with this
Bullet shook could make you take a bucket of piss
For runnin' your lips, got the fifth stuck in your ribs
Don't make me splash your lungs right in front of your kids
I'm a basket case, don't ever give this bastard space
Or I'ma have your ass erased, I'm from the Bronx amongst corrupt cops
We mothered this rap shit but still don't get enough props
All I hear is 'Gangsta', you ain't built like that
Don't make me have to pull a tool and really tilt your cap
I'm from crills to crack, you've been dealin' with rap
You ain't never run the streets, now I'm revealin' your act
What the fuck?
Ya'll wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick, never seen a crack house
Wanna a war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta
Ya'll wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick, never seen a crack house
Wanna a war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta

[Verse 1]
I wish I could be high forever
I wish my parents would have stayed together
I really hope I'm not wasting my time
Or my nickels and dimes tryna spit these rhymes
And I really hope you're content and shit
I mean, really I just wanna vent and shit
I remember holding you until the time ran out
Then I would hold on to your words and your scent and shit
But we don't even really talk no more
And I guess it kinda still fucks with me
Cause I couldn't guess where you are right now
And you were sorta like a must for me
But I couldn't be who you wanted me to
It was always a lack of trust from me
[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, but I know
How It be, how it go, oh
And I wanna give up but they say
It'll be okay
It'll be all just fine
[Bridge]
I wanna believe 'em but it's strenuous
I don't even know what's right no more
This loss of hope is continuous
I don't even have it in me to fight no more
[Chorus]
But I
If I give up, it will be the death of me
I know I can take over the world
But I
I can't give up, it won't get the best of me
I know I can take the world
[Verse 2]
I wish that you had a different perception
I wish I didn't try to chase perfection
I really just wanna face the world and chase my dreams
Without the fear of rejection
So I'm really tryna be brave right now
But I'm really losing all my faith right now
Because I'm looking at you and you looking at me
But none of us really know what to say right now
And I really can't change the situation
If I could you know I would with no hesitation
You know this world is a crazy place
I kinda wish we coulda changed the pace
I can't be who you want me to so I
I think its best that we keep the space
[Pre-Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I'm still wishing you would call my phone
Maybe you will once you hear my song
The heart gets heavy and the road gets long
Nightmares of growing old and being all alone
I'm really tryna chase my dreams though
Can't let love and these motherfuckers stop me
Cause sometimes we take advantage of these days too much
And these nights I don't even like to say too much cause I
[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna give up but they say
It'll be okay
It'll be all just fine
[Bridge]
I wanna believe 'em but it's strenuous
I don't even know what's right no more
This loss of hope is continuous
I don't even have it in me to fight no more
I don't even have it in me to fight no more
[Chorus]
I can't give up, it won't get the best of me
I know I can take the world
I know I can take the world

So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?
(Just another victim)
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?
(Just another victim)
Growin' up in these streets of Brooklyn
I'm out here in the hook when the world is shooken
Thug life's a tough one, my life's a rough one
Don't make me have to reach out and touch one
I'll break your frame up, turn the flame up
I'll bring your name up 'cuz you're a lame duck
The transmission, beat you to submission
You're just another victim here to rock the friction
I want it all and if it's led through you
You better find a place to hide 'cuz I'll tread through you
I'm gonna get mine so you know my name
Bet your ass 'cuz the mood's about to change
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?

Lemme tell ya exactly what'll happen
When I choke the punks out and people start clappin'
Set ya time, men don't faze and feel the rage of a psycho
Destroyer that you just can't take
Down for the count 'cuz I just won't let it
I'm here to break bones, ring the bell and let's get it
All for the strong just like Gladiators
Rip out your spine like the second Terminator
Haters, ain't got no time for your tactics
I see it right through you and your child-like tactics
No advances, no chances
Our persistence, there to beat down
(Beat him down, dog)
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?

Tazz is a miserable, angry thug
One word, one word describes the Tazzmission effectively
Tazz hates everyone, even himself
One word describes, one word describes the Tazzmission effectively
Who can stop the path of rage?
I got no friends, no allies, hell rises quick
No love for none of you 'cuz you despise my trip
Keep your distance, I don't need your assistance
'Cuz I'm built to last and made for resistance
The pit bull terrier, bone crusha
When I lock on ya, you scream like a busta
'Cuz that's the only way we know our kill
When you're a thug you're always taught to show no fear
I'm going head up, dead up
Will anybody in there make sure that
None of these son of a bitches get up
Gonna get mine, so you know my name
Be aware 'cuz the mood's about to change
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?
(Just another victim)
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?
(Just another victim)
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?

There is not a man or a beast on the planet Tazz cannot put out
(Just another victim)
There it is, he has it in, the Tazzmission
He tapped, he tapped, he tapped
(Just another victim)
Tazz, Tazz says that's all, Tazz says that's all
(Just another victim)
Who hasn't Tazz choked out?
(Just another victim)
The most miserable son of a bitch on the planet
The human suplex machine
Hey, I'm the end of the world on this son of a bitch
Tonight, right now, falls count anywhere in the building

They Still Gafflin
Damn, MC Eihts back in the mutherfuckin house.
Last year we came with the one times gaffled em up. why'knowutumsayin"
Now the whole mutherfuckin world know.
They still gaffling, this young black nigga.
So why in the fuck should I sleep when they creep
as I roll through the streets I see another raided house and
that's why the Eiht'll be out in 5000.
And the fools won't give a chance to explain.
If you're from Compton, you either sell dope or gangbang.
Yo those fools on my dick still trying to jack me.
I guess because I sport a hat and the khaki's.
And if my cars on hit then I'm a roller,
Bust a you, hit the sirens and pull me over.
Run a make on my plates, fool they legit.
Another day for this punk ass bullshit.
I was lucky, I threw the blunt in my sock.
The first thing they say, who's got the gat who's got the rocks?
I said please officer, I'm a rap singer.
Boy you from Compton you gots to be a banger.
where's your hood, what's your set, throw up your gang sign.
I takes my hands off the hood and says I ain't got time.
He's says park it fool times is wasting.
I said fuck you, black leather glove slapped my face then
I was pissed, it was rough, my hands was cuffed.
If I told them they stink they'd throw my ass in the clink.
So it was back to the curb and I sat.
All that time, fools didn't even find my strap.
But every day its the same shit happening, yo.
Watch your back one times still gaffling, geah.
Geah, now they still on my dick.
Still all wrastling, gaffling and shit.
can't take no more off this one time shit. why'knowutumsayin?
I'm ready to peel a mutherfuckers cap, why'knowutumsayin?
Check this out.
Off to the kick it spot to make an end.
Early in the morning so my day can begin.
I seen the fool that tried to double cross me.
I beat the punk down smooth cause I'm the boss, E.
2 niggas rolling, in hats, inside a cadillac.
We start to blaze up the mutherfucking 20 sack.
We rolled the windows up to get that contact.
One times seen the smoke they pulled a smooth jack.
On top of that I was bumping big noise.
It was the fucking CHP boys.
I didn't like those punk fools one bit.
Cause they be popping that KKK shit.
So I kick back and played with the routine.
and told the grand dragon I was 17.
Tell the police the truth then how the fuck that sound?
Cause if I told him the truth then I'd be county bound.
So I play with the routine, comma.
While he say, hand over the marijuana.
I said officer, you must be joking,
that was a cigarette I was smoking.
So I sat with my but to the ground.
And kept on thinking would the fool beat me down?
They didn't find the gatt, it was a miracle.
But they still toed my mutherfucking vehicle.
I might as well have packed a strap and.
Get rid of all these one times gafflin.

[Parrish Smith]
Sick em champ...
Well I have a new dance that you all must learn
You may have seen the Pee Wee Herman but it's had it's turn
Now this brand new dance I know you not with it
You might break your neck to really try to get it
If you seen the clumsy movie it was called The Jerk
You had to check out Steve Martin as he started the "Kirk"
He was doin freaky moves with his feet and head
With his blue farmer suit and his big Pro-Keds
Now if you want to learn it, it really takes time
That's why I'm here now tellin you this rhyme
And if you never seen it, then I'll be startin
My brand new funky dance, called the Steve Martin
Like this...get em Steve, get em
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em
Get em...
Like this...
[Erick Sermon]
Well the dance is def, and it's gonna last
I don't really think any other dance will pass
All the dancers out there tryin to freak on the floor
When they see me do the Martin they try to ignore
When they see my dance, they came to a surprise
I caught the suckers ducks speakin eye to eye
While they bitin my stuff, like I wasn't there
But they didn't have the right so, I didn't care
Sway your arms around your back, then across your chest
Do the crazy leg sweep from right to left
It's the Steve...
[Parrish Smith]
Like this...
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em...
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em...
Get em...
Well it's back to the man on the mic you see
Because I'm stuck to my dance like a dog on a flea
Now I know my dance is the funky dance comin
Pee-Wee Herman (Biz Markie) was pumpin (but mine is jumpin)
It's the Steve...
Like this, sick em champ
(Steve Martin's in full effect!)
Sick em champ
(Yo Steve's a weasel! Show em how your Steve Martin go)
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em [x4]
(Ahh yeah, Steve Martin in full effect)
EPMD, strikin once again, funky fresh in the flesh
(True, yo, PMD! Oww, yeah...)
I be the P double E-M-D in the place
(Yeah check this out P, I think this is the last record of the album...
Aww we made it!)
Yo yo what time is it?
[Erick Sermon]
Nineteen eighty-eight is so great, and eighty-nine even better
And don't forget, to take off that hot sweater...
Yeah check this out y'all!
We got this funky track, ahh, yo yo yo
Check this out homeboys
Because we dope, the dope-di-dope-di-dope-di-dope
The dope-di-dope-nope-we-ain't-no-joke
No-joke-no-joke, so PMD!! Yo!!
We ain't no joke, no-joke-no-joke-no-joke-the-dope
(On the Columbo tip!)
I'm the real deal homeboy, for real
(On the strength!)
Because we in there, yes we in there
And we're outta here, like last year
(We lost the bandwagon, because I'm housin...)
We goin straight for the kill because you're loungin
(I'm strictly business!)

Yo
We take a journey through music right now x2
Yo, when music temptations can't be resisted
Fifths will be unconsistent make me a misfit
Listed as a phenomenom I got an oncoming bomb
Which is perfection and flexin like I spent time in Nam
The beat is on and its nice an easy
Instrumentals blendin like cinnamon rice and peas
And lifes a breeze when you don't have to kick it to find
Contemplate the creation with blackalicious and I
Tuna fish is for a musical infant he's past gone
Tryin to hold fast and grasp hits like last fall
So last long flash on keepin the past strong
we grab songs and rhythm so people can catch on
Yes
My mic honor cause my momma I twiced promised her
Love life if music is truly your wife honor her
Burnin to your thermometer stretch a million kilomteres
Connect a population at birth to one another for real
[chorus]
Music, deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music, when the melody and rhythm get the moving an unity
Movin, one force one love one whole community
Do it, keep travelin on keep travelin on
Underground or overboard overload oh my lord
More remore pure sonic over joy sworn for shorts
Unseen aquatic bout to get explored
Warriors breakin all the limits twistin the laws
Now who said that underground is only just one more
I'm sellin time and space and matter makin hula-hoops of saturns rings
And bring my thing and sink to think
That these was meant to be writ if these spits will ever be writ
We on some destiny (shh shhh) we took a piece of this
We often testement on every cultural element
Ever sent to us by the ancestors as though we manifest it
Some new world pedestrians
just lounging with some fishin poles Up on the moons crescent
Just tryin to make some history spittin on a few records
I had a dream like martin luther king in adolescense
And now I'm out in tokyo and europe havin sessions
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin for was present
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin for was present
And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin off like army ho replay

CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS
Talkin bout walkin miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin bombs with no delay
[overlaps with chorus]
And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin off like army ho replay
Talkin bout walkin miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin bombs with no delay

Music, deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music, when the melody and rhythm get the moving an unity
Movin, one god one love one whole community
Do it, keep travelin on keep travelin on
Now see we rock around the clock we don't stop for nothin
Gonna take it to the top - non stop - no frontin
People listen when it drops cause it speaks to something
In they souls when they all alone spacing in the zone
Or walking they block - talking to they homey at the shop
See the point is this -
Even if the homey got the shot
Then there still be the bump knockin in your trunk
Get ya out your slump rockin it straight off the top
I'm cockin it like ingredients thrown hap-hazardly inside a crockpot
With a magic sock schnapps a big ass book and some vodka
And pass it my way cause I'm a real big talker
And i love new experiences I'm the godfather of gettin into to trouble
On the road undercover shit - take your whole crowd if you leave em uncovered
And i believe even hammer would say my shits proper work
Not to put a damper on the underground answer shit you dealin wit motherfuckas not underground anthem thugs
Rock from the west coast damn near the athens and you still hate a whack song
As much as the next man and still in love with the good one
We interact with listners this is our contribution on the war against
The whiteness is likeness a constitution of fatness blackalicious jurassic more lytyrical madness
Your mind is captured with tactics to get you back to the fatness
And you still want to battle just how long does this last?
We have the fashion to classic the pure love satisfaction
Is when the magic is captured live-action ain't tangible with

The kid with the broken halo
The devil won't seem to let me go
It's true the letters that they sent from school to my mother
Chino's too wild and does not play well with others
Rappers blinded and brainwash and need to be reminded
The Puerto Rican superhero no assembly required
Dark and agnostic, I torture you targeting my shit
Bastard be careful, like a nigga with glasses in a mosh pit
I flow free, spit religiously with each breath
With more lines than there are in Kimora Lee's neck
I'm sick with a pencil, he's done
But fuck sticking a fork in him, stab him with every kitchen utensil I can find
The brutalist, underpunched tutelage, proving it's in my jeans like true relig
The odds are slim to none that you can live
You don't want to be me is not convincing
It'll be cool to be you, just to witness my beauty in three diminsions
Necessary, vengence, losing my religion
Only five words that are worse for me to hear is
"Babe, I think I'm pregnant."
It's really nothing to murder cowards with a crowbar
And have them scared to leave the house for fear of death like Solar
I take credit for a ton of police, it's Chino's fault
Then carve my name in your face and fill the wounds up with table salt
The mission, infiltrate the system with or without guns
And choke you till your lungs have no air/heir like kings with no sons
The world told me, "Go to Hell", alright I'll meet you there
Latino's don't cheat death, we defeat it fair and square
Tearing your faggott ass in half and laugh and try to diss me
You ain't worth the urine particles existing in my piss stream
Since the cradle a word angel with a broken halo
The kid with the broken halo
The devil won't seem to let me go
They say that fake's the new real
I'll chop them up in suitcases, let the familiy pick one like it's Deal Or No Deal
They try to get at me, bitter the kid out spit they bosses
I'll have the studio literally littered with rapper's corpses
Bringer of death, barbarian will impale
If God was a rapper than He'd be Chino XL
Stuck up, snotty, known to body rappers biblically
Leave 'em like Sampson with his eyes gouged out by the Phiilistines
Of my own style, I'm the father, Maury Povich
Chino's so tight in the booth, I'm feeling clausterphobic
Free of the corporate theater, my heater is coming soon
If I attack you on stage you will not make it to your dressing room
They call me brutal cause I don't think a cop should shoot you
Then get away with it, we shouldn't have it, come on, be truthful
My homie tried to get a grant to go to school
All he was granted was Fox News views of Oscar Grant in his tomb
Guerilla monsoon with a blow torch
You can't hold a candle
Y'all ain't no vandals wearing skinny jeans and Croc sandels
My art canvas will start panics
Will heartlessly go to the Bronx Zoo bear handed to tear apart Pandas
I wanna scalp these traitors and bring out my native thoughts
Cause revolution has never been a spectator sport
Chino, the muscle fill will lay you down right in a tomb
There will be nowhere on your body that doesn't have a wound
I write like someone's life inside of a cartoon
The fiendish, human Venus Flytrap of raps is in full bloom
Heaven's on the payroll even with my broken halo
The kid with the broken halo
The devil won't seem to let me go

Ha ha ha
Do you see me now
You remember me the guy from the back of the class
That used to where the glasses the one you
Used to laugh at look at me now brother do you like fruit
Well I'm chewin' your girls nipples
How do you like them apples asshole
[Chorus]
I'm laughing at you
I'm laughing at you now you told me I was ugly
I was scared to crack a smile
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm laughing at you now
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm laughing at you
Six hundred Benz twenty inch rims
House on the hill hittin' mad skin
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine
So I was mean but I still had a scheme
17 years young everything seemed fun
Still considered a veteran 'cause I feared none
Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules
But carried heat 'cause he ain't no fool
Ain't no wrong for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us 'cause we've been down since the
Genesis two hundred horse power to four hundred Pegasus
The messages don't sleep till its over
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now I'm ice forever
Stomach bustin' out the white carrera
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
Ay que sera! what can I do but take you to strive
Ay que hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I win!
[Chorus]
Now its not funny 'cause I'm hot and got a pot of money
Alot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man
I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor
I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the Cubans
To provide now it's my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Ain't nothin' change I'm still humble and modest
And I'm always proud to admit I came straight from the projects
Hardy har har har
Don't you forget about me now
Don't
Don't
Don't
Don't
Don't you forget about me now
Don't
Don't
Don't
Don't nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Don't you forget about me now
Don't

Don't you forget about me now

Don't nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Don't you forget about me now
I said don't don't don't don't
[Chorus]

Now, who got the chance to make things right?
Why the politicians always want to fight?
The Christian coalition and the right wing ooooh!
Let me tell you what you can do
Step outside the cone of silence
Too much hatred and violence
It's time to rewind
We need a military decline
Got the power of the mind focused
Government like a locust
Are we gone or just going?
Time to act on what we be knowing why'all
Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the, we got the
We got the, we got the
Eyes on the prize and never wane
Take the bull by the reins
If you want it be the change
Like Gandhi and MLK
Wait up, got to change the system
Need knowledge, power and wisdom
Same way I rock this microphone
Speak up, just let it be known
Hey ladies, fellas
And everyone between
Take the power back, let them react
And let's show them what we mean, check it out
Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the, we got the
We got the, we got the
We can work, walk, march and protest
Think about how we approach this
Ask questions but they keep frontin'
Due time we change a little something
said hey, yo, don't you know
Won't forget Amaduous Diallo
To the crooked people and the crooked cops
Got to spread love before the world goes pop
Never again should we use the A-bomb
We need an international ban on
All W.O.M.D.'s gone
Talking multilateral disarm
Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the, we got the
We got the, we got the
Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the, we got the
We got the, we got the
We got the, we got the
We got the, we got the

Pushin platinum sellin gold (If you aint know)
[Ben Hated]
I stand here all night dressed like mo do's
Hustlin up outta four doors
Candy Caprices no mo', Escalades twankin Momo's
Who lookin, boy we is so pro, slow is just how we seem
Yayo weighed up on beams, for geekers that wanna dream
That's how I made my cream
With a down ass hoe, and a down as scheme
And a down as team fulla down ass niggaz that's down for green
I see how y'all watch and wait, hope I decide to navigate late
Dont run up wrong and meet your fate maker
Long as I get your weight maker
They call me Mr. Bossy, molases paint silver glossy
Fuck what it cost me, I'm Mr. Flossy get the hell off me
Ben Hate bout G's, Ben Hate 'bout multiplatinum CD's
Hell, Hate bout grind, Ben Hate bout hustle, Ben Hate bout mine
Steppin out this time, in aligators, glock for them haters
Hollow tips so they cant fade us, big money makers
You see me on the seen so clean, black magic gleam
Draped up in orange & blue (orange & blue), rollin wit' my team
Chorus
[Re-Re]
Hell nah
Hell it aint road, industry execs see me
Guys leave, my flow be so lovely
Comin through like the folks in the back door
See me, be like Puffy gotta get the dough
Gonna let me ride the track
Seein how these folks be makin tha money stack
Matter of fact cant call the cat
Cause they chillin like a bad rat breakin off cheese like a Kit-Kat
Now check that, the man with the Rolex and the diamonds in his hand
Girls in the club wanna holla Cause they think he is the man
But I cant stand them pretty ass bitches and niggaz they gettin up on my nerves
And while they in my face, they actin fake, I'm kickin 'em to the curb
So what it concern, on whether I ball or stand on my own 2 feet
Got you niggaz dislikin me , they cant get like me
I'm jumpin five bitches, over five geeks
Dont make no sense 'til you ask me
Cause I'm on top, make you wanna have me
I'm just smoke a blunt, march 2 steps in front
Cause haters aint never gon find me
Try to put the mean mug on when I come around
Nigga like you wanna give me a pound
But you comin at me like you brainy
Talkin 'bout you just wanna be down
Yeah right, nigga know you cant get wit' Re
So you better just have a seat
I'm on top my game, that's why you know my name
I done hit that fame now what it's gon be
Chorus
Ben Hated:
Wood grippin, Henn sippin
Pistol hold and pistol whippin
All lames that talk 'bout trickin
Dump them thangs and get to dippin
Type of niggaz, that slide all custom trucks
With the dubs, all chrome, grill bars, and them 2-colored cuts
Pros, stand on the block, they nuts
Sick of them thugs and cut-butts
Jump in the 'Lac and shawty get cut
Hop in the 'Gator woe's get stuck, what's up
These bustaz wanna try me, I pull they girl when they alk by me
Leave 'em upset lookin mad, and dog, face lookin sad
I dont sweat these pros man, I lick these pros man
And I bent these pros, Jump in the car with ballers on Vogues
If you got a Benz with them ends you cn freak out her friends
Sent that tramp out to your partnaz lake, night shake the show stoppers
Welcome to my game, I do this thang wit' no shame
And if them folks ask, then tell 'em my name, Mr. Ghetto Fame
I dont say no words just lay it back
Let my girl hold on my strap
I dont trust these lames
I fuckin crush these lames, touch these lames
Chorus

[Hook number two - Iriscience and (Evidence)] X2
There ain't nothing as bright (as heavy) as light

As ready (as right) as loose (as tight) as quick to expand
As we on the mike
[Verse number one - Iriscience]
If it was a snake it would have bit ya'
Slithered up like a boa-consticta and griped ya'
Step back and beat the big picture
These cats as though in my head
I charge the mound just to get the picture
Bitch clearest specialist better hit ya'
But never miss ya'
y'all need to double check the scripture
Deco, Deco, unload, reload
Pressin' heights Peco, live like Steve Beko
Piss on trees and leave marks to graffiti
Even gang graffiti though I'm for the peace treaty
Frustrated cats we hussle but still needy
And whistle like Twity when we see the LAPD
We going four for score for the prize
You need to see with more than your eyes
It's war in disguise
Tanfa callas are vagrants
This goes for every agent
Some are camouflaged others are very blatant

[Verse number two - Evidence]
Se keep your torch lit, light your flares, have back ups prepared
Wait for the enemy, war is declared
Expansion Team Theme music anthem
Got coloured schemes hot, peak lovers red at random
Up close and personal, songs from my journal
My lyrics are the ink, my reflection is eternal
These words are powerful, so hard to describe
Type to raise eye brows and open eyes
But what we did, get your hands dirty, fingers dusty
I've been around the world, you haven't, you could trust me
Line them up, knock them down,
Keep them cocked, beats and vocals
If you fuck with these locals catch ghost busters logo
Channel zero
Separate suckers from heroes, recorded digital Bobby Deniro
Load your base bags, put on your gloves, lace the shoes
Keep your eyes open for signs and ears open for clues

[Eminem]
I come around like what goes around.
What goes up must come down.
Anyone who comes up must go down.
Might as well go for the gusto now.
Better not let up, better not let them breathe.
Last shot give it all you got.
Try to turn me down bitch get fucked with the volume nob,
Fuck all you snobs.
Hoes I hope all you rot.
Two bottles of luburdom and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
And you wanna minaj a trois, you twots?
Fuck that I'd rather turn this club to a ballroom brawl.
Get as rowdy as Routhlisberger in a bathroom stall.
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum ya'll ain't nothtin but a whole lot of suckin' goin' on in rap.
Yeah but I'm home.
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
Let him alone,
You don't wanna go eggin' him on.
It'll never be my chair that you're on.
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen.
Otherwords there's no heir to the throne.
When I die so does hip hop.
Hitchcock better shit bitch ass gotgot a zip locked in a bag.
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone, like I'm in the twilight dog get off my bone this is my mic doggone it I like hogging it.
Flow so wet I'ma take this beat tobogganin.
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it.
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it.
Suplexin it on cement, like I'm on some straight outta compton shit
Take this dick and chomp on it.
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment.
Jackass eat a donkey dick.
The game I just about conquered, it like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this honkey shit.
No sense screaming and arguing.
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.
You think you ball, well I palm it.
I throw up bombs when I vomit.
Boy I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelet.
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.
Bitch I'm as bat shit as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell I go right off the bat.
No pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head.
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web, I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage.
I catch a fly in that bitch.
You think you fly, you just food.
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude.
Guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and bamboozled, confused as usual, and you can get ripped she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat, or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken.
Yeah, it's Shady slut, the rest can suck on a big one.
'Cause I'm despicable as daffy duck when I'm spitting.
(Haha recovery)
[End]

We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm
They want sacrifice
They hatch schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife
I've got an appetite
For nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by
New metaphors
View that are better for you can't survive if I'm your competitor
Rise together or fight separate wars
I pray I'm never forced to be a predator
Spectres spectate
We wont last
They glad to hate
When gladiators
Breathe their last
Scream en masse
When the dreams do clash
Like the swords in the wars
Let me bleed on that
But they feed on that
Say we need strong backs
Call us weak
If we don't redeem contracts
But the feast wont last
When this beast attacks
The sons and the fathers
Will be free at last
This is love this is not treason
They see sharks in the estuary
They claim the arc's Bartholomew's
They say war is necessary
But we say war is child abuse
We'd rather make our children martyrs than murderers
We'd rather make our children White Flag Warriors
Core-to-core
Were the ones
We've been waiting for
We hold steady
Steadier than stevedores
Not tevias or matadors
On matters of what came before
Forgive the debts
To settle scores
Test the mettle
Either ore
Whats your plan got to do with me
If the bell tolls let freedom ring
And find new ways if we must be King
Instead of leading the young to our suffering
We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesdays at eleven
Wanna recruit and train us to act evilly?
Save it for the shooting range and smack DVDs
Won't study war no more this millennium
It's never again to me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murderers
They shell dwellings to quell the shelling
They lift taboos to seduce the cowards
They say we're too yellow-bellied
But we say we're the new superpower
We seek waivers to not be liable
We claim to speak for a higher truth
We stand opposed to the homicidal
We tell you you're fireproof

And yes, we're gonna party for the right to fight
We're international like Matt Takei
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and
What we do now is future molding
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen
We need a bit more gun controlling
Right (right) now (now) what is goin' on?
We (we) gotta (gotta) get it goin' on
Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long
When I get on you scream "Hoo, tight!"
Rockin' this flow I could go all night
I'm not here to fight, or incite
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The US attacking other nations
Anhiliations, on every station
False election's got me losing my patience
Well, I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way, and
I got to say fuck the KKK, and
Oh, yeah hey, how about today?
If you want to set it off then let me hear you say
Right (right) now (now) what is goin' on?
We (we) gotta (gotta) get it goin' on
Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long
I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down human inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
So please pass me the Reunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not berserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
Keep the mind alert and not revert
Right (right) now (now) what is goin' on?
We (we) gotta (gotta) get it goin' on
Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long

Verse 1 (Skandalous)
Motherfuckers they wanna test me
Pull out the blunt nigga I'll wreck your shit
I'm out that window with my 44, another fucking hit
Don't know who to trust with my shit
I'm in this click, you in my hood you better know who you fucking with
Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
Nigga I'm at your door, don't pray to God cause you done lost your grace
Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face
I got the mind of a psycho ass ??
As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
I sold my soul at an early age
And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
My eyes in a daze
Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
Is juices running when ya done in
Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they
Dead
Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
Talking shit up in my territory
Another day another world's sad story
Verse 2 (Steph)
Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block
Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock
Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
Freeze your whole coalition
Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
This figure from head to toe
Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
You hoes ain't fucking with that
Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission
Trying to recondition your stilo
Lyrical nino
I sling rhymes like kilos
>From here to Puerto Rico
One other sequel from the infamous unseen
Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine
Verse 3 (Mia X)
Cause she up to schemes
Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
Mia's right and left well known with the clout
To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
That's what this here be bout
So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
Too much to deal with
I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
But I sees nothing but dollars
Feminist power
My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her
Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4
How they still need a ladder to face this hoe
For sure, cause I be living for the drama
The biggest mama flexing shutting down this motherfucking basement sesion
Shop closed

[Foxy] This one, is dedicated, to you
[Wayne Wonder]
Foxy Brown.. Wayne Wonder..
Puttin it down.. whoa-oh-oh-oh.. c'mon
[Chorus: Wayne Wonder]
But the saddest day of my life
was when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain - the pain, the pain
The saddest day of my life
was when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane - yeahh-yeahh
[Foxy Brown]
Now I'm the type of bitch that's one of a kind
y'all know, the kind of bitch that like to sip that fine wine
Like to be on top or, get it from behind
Either way I throw the pussy like the free throw line
Break a nigga spine, tote a calico and dare
any bitch fi come try test mine
Violate, one time, I cock the nine
You, motherfuckin right I bust a bitch over mine
Shit, niggaz can cheat and put tips in bitches waist
But when we slip up, get a gun in our face
Have me missin show dates, heart beatin slow pace
Wonder what he doin, who the fuck he screwin
Bitches ain't shit; know that that's your man
and they still fuck around and try to suck the nigga dick
And I'm a bad bitch, I don't play that bullshit
Bitch'll catch wreck, I ain't got a full deck nigga
[Chorus]
[Foxy Brown]
Ever since I was a little girl, always wanted to know
How the fuck these niggaz think, why de man a move so
Why would you jeapordize your whole life
Fuckin one bitch for one night; blame it on the liquor
How would you feel if I fucked another nigga
and told you that that motherfucker made me cum quicker?
You'd probably grab the gat and put two in my back
One in my face, nigga but it's one in my waist
Go 'head and slip, watch me shut down this bitch
Cheat on who? Nigga I'll be gone before you
And when you with the one you love, disrespect the game
'fore he drive you insane, losin your fuckin brain
[Wayne Wonder]
Foxy Brown.. Wayne Wonder..
Puttin it down.. whoa-oh-oh-oh.. c'mon
[Chorus]
[Foxy Brown]
For months I used to cry, felt like I wanted to die
Kept asking God why, do I deserve this?
We all make mistakes, ain't nobody perfect
We're human, and through it all, I remained a good woman to you
Prayin for strength and losin my faith
How could you lay in our bed and lie in my face?
Jumpin out my sleep
Havin nightmares of me tossin and turnin, my heart still burnin
Watchin me suffer, relivin my fears
Holdin my pillow close while you dryin my tears
Stop your blood claat cryin, need to stop lyin
and look me in my eyes 'fore these plates start flyin
And how the fuck could you disrespect us
Everything we stand for, all our love and our trust
Seems like I said before, you won't appreciate me
and everything we have 'til I'm out the fuckin door
[Chorus]
[Wayne Wonder]
Try to erase, all the memories
They're the ones they gon' see
If I could forget, all about the past
Oh no no no - how long will this go onnnn?
[Chorus]
{*Wayne Wonder ad libs to fade*}

Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I'm like, "eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I'm like, "eh"
Two-letter text, translation, "next!"
Skip that rerun like ya see one
Seen 'em all, get "eh"
Have you the slightest I.D. why?
You're so trifling
Second I see you coming I'm teeth-sucking like, "eh"
My voice, "eh"
See my reflection, "eh"
Invited, excited, "eh," "eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I'm like, "eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I must confess, I'm like, "eh"
No one's ever seen me feel shit but "eh"
Lil' bits of "eh" gleaming like Piss Christ
Cover me like skintight
Why my rep is like why they might be right
I'm kinda sketch, I might
Shoot a glance at the desperate, like
Then I forget shit like Death Grips like, eh
I wave them off, I wave them in
Gotta flake, I fuck 'em off 'cause I ain't them
I'm like, "eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I'm like, "eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I'm like, "eh"
My approach like, I'm ghostlike
I'm out of focus 'cause
I'm coated with the most stripes
Late movement on my trajectory
Anomalous like entropy
Make all things perforated
They apply iodine to trace this, I'm like, "eh"
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I'm like
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I'm like "eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I'm like, "eh"
Who put your obese flex on ice?
Whose effortless corrupts your dice?
Who does you just like I told you?
Tell me, what's it like, I'm like
Don't be a, don't be a
'Bout mummified worm in the sun
When shit's up to me 'cause
I figure I'll watch you urn, I'm not concerned
I'm on leisure like, "eh"
I'm just on leisure
Why fuss don't be a medical procedure
Just stamp my fucking visa
I'm way too loose like
Catch me hanging from my noose like, "eh"
How I vandalize full moon like
You're so serious, ease off
I don't feed animals, you seem lost
I'm offended like, but in the end I'm like, "eh"

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'm a take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Its unfortunate but its
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your as addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I'm a
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life

Hoppin off the mother fucking G5 with stunna
F430 mr. burn rubber
Furniture from Italy
Light marble floor
Do not be alarmed thats just my butler at the door
And I got my own chef, I dont even eat out
Body guards on pay role, ready to knock your teeth out
Buying all the bottles, chillen with some models
Balling everyday like, I hit the lotto

In these times of hurt and pain
We need a remedy to take us from the rain
A little hunger, a little greed
I been thinking 'bout what I need
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak everyday and every night
I need a freak, someone like you
I need a freak cause freaks are people too
I need a freak to suck my dick
I need a freak baby, muthafuck a trick
I need a freak, my own private hoe
I need a freak to work that pussy fast and slow
I need a freak, my baby doll
I need a freak when I'm ridin' 7 Mile
I need a freak, someone like you
I need a freak cause freaks are people too
I need a freak to get me served
I need a freak to calm my nerves
I need a freak to roll my weed
I need a freak, that's what I need
I need a freak
I need a freak
I need a freak
I need a freak

They say if you ain't got no money take yo broke ass home
I say if you got you two dollars, then come through to my party
But get bent before you come because for that liquor I'll be charging
And take down these directions
It's right past the intersection
Make a right at the light
It's the first house on the left
And get it, got it good
You made it, I knew you would
We got them drinks up in the back and them chic-key's looking good
Hold up, here come one ay what's yo name hun?
Jackie brown, yea that pop
Ay I'm chuck, this Mikey rocks
And let me introduce you to some kids that you ain't used to
Yep we bet that we ride bikes
Carrying bones and Jordan 5's
Got every single color so
Just in case you wonder
My party's is always live
As a mother is for supper and
In the summer when it's hotter then the oven
We the coolest kids we know
So you know we into something
That involve doing something
With a trunk to get that bass drum pumping
It's my party, so get up
If you don't you getting jumped
[Chorus: x2]
What's happening?
Where's the party?
Say you heard me say there's a party
Right around my way
So if you finna' start it
Then don't do nothing small
Get everyone involved and
Say that it's a party
What's happening?
Where's the party?
Say you heard me say there's a party
Right around my way
So if you finna' start it
Then don't do nothing small
Get everyone involved and
Say that it's a party
One to the two
Three to the four
Chuckey and mike is at yo door
We don't knock
We straight on that
"when yo album drop"
You can wait on that
I don't don't like the questions you ask so
Let me tell you a little about myself
Everywhere I go I act an ass
And if you ain't know
Better go and ask
At every party
I hop the bar
And then dance with the chicks
On top of that
Bartender be like, get off of that
I'm like not till I get rich off of rap
And I look to the left, she dipping her hips
And making her lips, at me I guess
And I look to the left and look to the right
Point to my chest and she was like "that's right"
Now let me tell you the recipe
To all you niggas tryna' get like me
It takes a scoop of being cool
And the recipe include it
When you purchase my movie
Cause if you knew what I knew
You would prolly' try to
Do whatever I do
Prolly' move to Chicago
If you want instructions
Then I could prolly' front them
Just as long as you shortys pay attention
So if you ugly keep you hands by yo side
But if you not then put em' in the sky
And if you knowin' what it is
There's a party at the crib
Come and party with the kids
[Chorus: x2]

Mommy, my heart is broken
Because my daddy might fix it!
Yea, I'll fix it, come here
Mommy can you move away?
Come lie in your space, I'll tell her to go fix it. I'll fix it, lie in the space here
But mommy can't have a space for me here
She's just dreaming. She's dreaming. Let me make a space, yeah?
Heh, sorry
No problem. Just tell me what's the problem.
Is your heart, is your heart, how does it feel?
What's wrong with it? Is your heart broken? Okay, I'll fix it
Fix it like this, do that
Just give me one tuck, I just love you so much
I can't get a tuck because my heart is broken
I'll fix it
My heart is fixed!
Mommy my heart is fixed

And all alone through ya neighborhood at high exhaust
High stylin and profilin, niggaz comin after me
In actuality they face the technicality
Let 'em feel the battle, it was a tragedy
Everywhere a nigga die for the salary
Pray to God, pray to Lord, watch after me

We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it
[Chorus: x2]
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where will you go)
After you die (after you die)
[death]
You fucked up nigga!
[Busta Rhymes]
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checking
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
That's when it starts hitting the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't making fun of them niggas
I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggas
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is looking dumb, it's getting hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue fronting, like it's nothing while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You trying to hide your expression from looking worried
On what to do when your career is buried
[Chorus]
[Busta Rhymes]
Niggas ain't giving a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fucking the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't paying and booking you for shows no more
You ain't whipping the range, you ain't whipping a rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweating every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're only lying to yourself cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holding on to them days when everything was about you
But niggas don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothing
You doing shit and front to prove to people you mean something
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't getting in
Forgetting you a man first, chasing the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, repping your name proper
But most niggas don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried
[Chorus]
Okay
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
At a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay
Nigga shut the fuck up and get in the box nigga! (wait! please!)
It was custom built for all niggas like you
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(stop! bitch!) see you in the afterlife nigga (wait! help!!!)
Whever the fuck that is!! (somebody help!!)
(i can't breathe, nigga!)
(open this shit nigga!)
(open this shit!!)
(open this shit!!)
(somebody help!! hey!!)
(open this shit motherfucker what you doin)
(open it!)

I don't understand
Why are you bein' so mean!?
You're a mean, mean man!
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close em'
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo
Syke, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listening
OK now I need your un-divided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this,
Undeniable tension from the moment I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversations why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me
Is it just because
You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was
I fucked up,
Syke, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
That I could bust one take
Without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth OK
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
You're mouth is open,
You're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch,
A bunch of sweets or somethin'
What you munch a bunch of crunch-a-munch?
You're tooth is rottin' through the gum
Your breath stinks,
Want to chew some gum?
(Yes I do sir what am I on?)
You sir are on truth serum
[Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed
I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out
Why I'm saying all these terrible, evil, and awful
Mean things, is my own insecurities!
You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like
When he takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like
Want to check to see? Here's a mirror
Notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how bout' now
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em'
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you
I know you're not happy,
I know you'd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like stickin' a banana between 2 oranges
Why are you even doin' this to yourself?
It's pointless,
Why do we have to keep on going through this?
This is torturous
My point is this, that if you say mean things,
You're weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Fuck off my dick

It\'s true, money do talk cuz we conversated.
That\'s why everything I do I get compensated.
It\'s easy to get cheese, it aint complicated.
A nigga got what you need you go and confiscate it.
I\'m kinda hated but the love kinda dominate it.
I aint lyricist of the year, but I was nominated.
My whole family on the grind so I\'m crime related.
All this time I waited to shine, it\'s bout time I made it.
The drama, save it, I aint lookin for beef.
I\'m sittin in the kitchen cookin the geese with no feathers and beaks.
We way better you could never compete.
You hear how Swiss put together the beat?
He make it easy for me.
I paint pictures make it easy to see.
It aint nuttin to talk greezy to me, I

I\'m a gangsta you can tell by my verses I am.
Let me explain what kind of person I am.
When I was young they called me a BeBe kid,
I was worser than them.
I was wild as a child and got worser at 10. When
I start dislikin the rules like it was cool.
Actin a fool, fightin, bringin knifes to my school.
I cooled down at 13 and start mackin the whores,
that\'s when I fell back and started actin mature.
I hit the scene at 15 and started gettin a name cuz I was rhymin and grindin, I was gettin the change.
A couple years later got down with the team.
I was signed to Ruff Ryders movin pounds of the green.
I did a groove album, but I aint get a release,
that\'s when I politiced with Swiss and started rippin his beats.
But I was still hittin the streets and sellin the cain.
I\'m a hustla, muthafucka tell em the name.

Killas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch
Killas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, Blaze
G's up, ridin' from the cradle to the casket
And beyond, recognize thug shit
Poundin' out the trunk bitch
Runnin' wit' a mother fuckin' hatchet
You haters, you suck dick was a thug, became a G
B to the L to the A, Z, E, still dead
Still don't give a fuck (give a fuck)
Sportin' all black kahkis with the mother fuckin' cuffs up
Smokin' Hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's
So a thug can get back on his feet
Mean muggin', steady thuggin'
And I'm tryin' to find the hoodrat's all about fuckin'
Still loked out
All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out
Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat ass ride
So I can drop the top, and parlay through the east side
[Chorus: x4]
Niggas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch!
Bitches freeze, you ain't a thug or a G or a banga'
You's a studio gangsta
You aint about shit, scared to pull the trigga'
That's what we call, a real bitch nigga' (bitch nigga')
Sneekin' through the hood, throwin' up a set
Hangin' out the window, yellin' idol threats
Check this out, I'm a check your chin
Close your mouth, 'fore I put the barrel in
Dumpin' clips in yo ass is what I'm all about
Straight G from the clique on a paper route
Still slappin' off fake bitches with the Louiville
Beat a nigga' to the pavement, another bitch killed
[Chorus]
This is the battle for the planets
We bring the thunder, givin' half the advantage
Fuck a style and a status
Half of y'all hummin' off a half ass deal
And got the nerve to tell a mother fucker 'keep it real'
We see through y'all fools, like cellophane on the square pack
You bite our shit, you can keep it, we don't want it back
We don't give a fuck, east side for life
And if you aint got heart, don't expect to have your shit tight
There aint no room for the hoe-hearted
We give a fuck where you at, or who you wit', or how you got started
Fuck you and everybody in yo clique
If you don't run wit' a hatchet, or claim the Psychopathic
I aint got time, to say no names
It's only eight rhymes, no holla', we been in the game
Besides fuck it, no speakin your name
You're just a bitch in the game
And y'all niggas gone' always be the same
[Chorus: x8]

I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life
I like a girl with extensions in her hair
Or it could be hers, either way I don't care
Walkin to the laundromat in your uggs and sweats
With ya head scarf on and you still look fresh
And the, latest fashion hood but so classic
You got your own cash, you don't never have to ask
Cause you're independent, Chanel, Louis, Fendi
And on a light day, you might h&m; it, Century 21 can't wait to be 21
And you know everybody so you stay in the loop
Kick it with your home girls after school on the stoop
You can have jays on and you still look cute
This what I like, man what a sight
Such a girly girl but you be ready to fight
Wasn't raised round here but sometimes I stay
So let's hear for the girls from around the world
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life
Standing at the bus stop, shuffle through your iPod
Hustlers try to kick it to you, every time they drive by
Bye, with the boom and system, if he don't come correct I know you'll dismiss him
Got style, you want you a man but not know
Cause you focused on school, so it's gonna be a while
You can walk with a strut and talk the streets slang
Mary J, Chaka Khan, you still my sweet thang
With a petite frame and your nice round round
From the projects, but you can fit in downtown
Summer time, at the park, while the homeboys ball
Everybody jocking you but it aint your fault
Cause they don't do it like you, nah, and you know it
Got a lot of confidence, step afraid to show it
Wasn't raised round here but sometimes I stay
So one time for the girls from around the world
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life
I've been looking for that special round the way girl
You were right here all along
Didn't never go that far at all
To find my round away girl
I've been all, around the world
And I finally found my true around the way girl
She so hood, that's alright
Cause I need that type of loving in my life.

Roll with ??? you, that's my word

Your women cuttin and pistol bustin, we all grow
Ask my cousin whether his stubborn ass responded
He doesn't, it ain't a lie, we all came from nothin
But that ain't a reason to love Fiend no lesser
And this ain't for the pity, whatever
For the ones that lick it together
Look, I really ain't gon' be here, drinkin and smokin
Maybe not see clear
But dog I sobered up
Still survive a Fiend, gone, soldier what
Ain't nothin changed ask Tre, still feel with those ???
Numb, can't feel whether it's cold or what
Kept a not-not, but what a time, look, it rolled me up
Don't wanna hold ya up, keep ya knees so covered
And I'm a tell her everyday her uncle love her

Lord I'm sorry I didn't pray last night, I was tired
Runnin through the porch tryna' get on the Red Eye
Lately I ain't prayed for a minute, man I'm fallin
These demons they got cell phones and lately they been callin
And lately I been listenin
Lord, does it really matter if I'm Muslim or Christian
Juan's case he didn't win, is he out, or in
Sometimes I wish he wasn't born in this world of sin
Bless his soul, but now my soul is on wait
Lord I'm askin, now I'm beggin, please don't close the gate
Lord I'm comin, I'm tired but my soul keeps runnin
I told him you were comin but my people did nothin
Little Justin, tell 'em I love him, I didn't rub him or hug him
And tell him don't start thuggin like his big brother Lavell
Ain't no price in this world for your soul to sell
It's gettin warm around here, am I in Heaven or Hell

Burn train buffers
My fancy
Up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
Never give a fuck how far Pi went
You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist
Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
Wookie foot must not sleep
Under the invaders
No batteries
No jumper cables
Wired underagers play box cutter facelift
Rock utter makeshift spirit
To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
And a bangin' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list
Walk for that
Metal train graf brainiac
Walk for them
Not a limelight
more to blush alizarin crimson
when the multi million
Tin men suck traditional rituals
Out the homes of starving children
And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
Dirty dub vamp.
Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser
Mars attacks colorfulness
I piss raptors on motherships
Hazy days will stay purple
Cause Cips with a Z bargain
Like Crazy Eddie commercials
Go Ah AH AHH AHHH

Burn train buffers.
Hi!
Cute the way your little parasol spins.
Bye!
Suck my Neanderthal dick.
Catapults spit.
Losing the screws and bolts

Pick a lust.
Limo tint stretch delorian chrome sittin on twenties
Then I walk to the stouge, burning my laundry
Lo Pro,
fucked up jeans back at the party spinning Kane meets Flight of the Valkryies in a heartbeat.
Saber tooth, catalog, city art, liturgy
Ranger Ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency
And isn't that dope?
The line of blind winged Pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos.
Binder bibles and a graphite prison violator
with Joshua for the war gamer systems.
Now the architects are rioting cause we built something different
I'm like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business?
My elephant television was on.
Grape soda, Grape ape, Great space coaster,
DnD, GI Joe, Transformer, Herculiod, ThunderCat, Voltron, Speed Racer, Space Ghoster.
Kiss the flickering images with Carroll Ann fingertips,
see-4 to four chamber skips,
Ohh shit...
They say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat
Woke first words: "Oh it's like that?"
Started bendin spoons and rippin arrows outa lady hawks

Right turn woulda missed the iceberg, fine.
But you don't like our kind. Do you?
Junkyard Dog. Hot tin roofs cradle kittens with them sub par flaws.
Rappin is my radio, graffiti is my TV.

And my hood run through me so I'm repping it right
Vainglorious, my niggas can trust

Nigga ghetto for life and I'm Be here forever
Thug niggas from these streets and we hustler for cheddar
So we can live better and have bigger thangs
Blow joke all day and sip on champagne
See in this that I call home
We slang crack all night till the early mourn
First street across the Georgia where I got it on
Sticky pants and t-shirts with my fucking stone
Mean-mug on my face everyday, home
I keep my radio tune to this ghetto song
And pray to God that it won't be long before we hit the top
I shit blow up nigga and hit the fucking chart
A nigga riding
[Chorus]
[Bone Crusher]
Hit the rib shack for a little snack
I see this little shawty with the donkey in the back
"Only in the hood with ya fineness, just so fine ghetto princess"
Why not? My focus is all that I got
Shout's out to Goodie Long stay strong Cool Joe
We done it we all foe
I wish them young niggas would get off the blow
But it's like this in every ghetto
But I stay strong maybe thers's some hope
I like to have fun but life ain't a joke
Sometimes I just wanna sit back and smoke
[Chorus: x2]

Supahero
Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
He ain't nowhere to be found, when he should be fighting evil
You make me whole It's not the movies, but it fake the role
I try to take control for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me, said â??break the moldâ??
I put foot to the concrete and shake the road
I don't have powers like a caped crusader
But I do have powers like an Ace invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him, and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
Your hit channel's evil on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor
I really don't know what you thinking of
I can't make it wet from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the ball but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
And just me is what I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham where every day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing
I ain't laying my coat down; know what I'm saying?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ended all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams

Reason
Is there any reason
Why my heart must now understand?
We had the fire so many times
Changes like the season
Convinces me that we've come to an end
Your love was indescribable
Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh
Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh
And as I watch, I see before my eyes
The truth is my reality
My emotions are high
And I'm at risk of falling again
Right now everything's on the line
Being alone is not what I prefer
But I've got to face this feeling
With grace I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be 'round
Holler, holler, holler, holler
Holler, holler, holler, holler
Please don't try
To make me less than I am
Let's not drag it out anymore
With grace I politely remove myself
With grace I'm all too willing
'Cause being alone is not what I prefer
But I've got to face this feeling
With grace I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be 'round
With grace I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be 'round
Holler, holler, holler, holler
Holler, holler, holler, holler
With grace I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be 'round
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be 'round
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be 'round

[Chorus]
"Huh, huh, huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me, and she was feeling blue," I said
"Huh, huh, huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me, and she was feeling blue," I said
"Huh, huh, huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me, and she was feeling blue," I said
"Huh, huh, huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me, and she was feeling blue," I said
"Huh, huh, huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me, and she was feeling blue," I said
I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
Thirty-six-twenty-four-thirty-six; I looked to her, and I said "I need a fix."
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my one-eight hundred beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off, then I will be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond; I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over twenty-one; here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez
[Chorus]
As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my one-eight hundred beeper
Call me loony, crazy, psychotic, or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
Come and get me from Mickey D's at eight
That's where I work after school; pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is a goof
Am I robbing a cradle? I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez
[Chorus]
Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number; that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked "What do you want?"
She said "A pair of earrings."
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came, and she gave a party
I arrive kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace
"How old are you now?" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed "Sixteen!"
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez!
[Chorus]

(BLH)
Say I got a split personality
The day time I'm cool Nite time
No electricity, no car payment
Make me just wanna to rape shit
Scrape shit off the concrete and eat it
Believe it I can get devious like Lil' Bro
Criminal call me the cream of crop of Sacramento though
Why do they want to get severed up to many mini meat lits
Why every time I get drunk and high can't trust a nigga like a secret
So I commence to make the meat rip that's all I ever think about
Bellpeppers and hot sauce high blood pressure shit
Tell Lecter I eat it raw damn near rare
This album suppose to make you wanna eat spare ribs
I don't never wanna spare his life
Fuccin' rape his wife razor blade the kife ya
Sever your wife up watch the knife cut ya picture it like nite time
I spit posion like a python, shit got to get the lights on
When the lights on human meats all over the room, blood all over the room
Siccle pysycho Siccle Cell Anemia just light up the ooze
(Chorus)
I don't wanna say shit
I just wanna rape shit
I just wanna flay bitches
Nite time day and nite
Nitetime AK shit
My other half sayin' don't do it
But at close range split your brain shit
1(I can't speak don't) 2(I can say it) (X2)
(BLH)
Friday the 13th my day to work meat
Butcher shoppin' for Halloween
Took it chop it pop it hollow tips
I don't wanna get to pushin' the issue
But this is who listen to sicc shit
I don't need to get him look at him cook him
Took at him some of the siccness
I be havin' them fits wit them bitches and niggaz
I sticcin' them wit ice piccs Split
Personality shit liquor kill'em up shit
Dose of that fill'em up
Niggas get heated up like gasoline
After i put that gasoline on em
transform em to liquid
ima misfit cannabalistic
?
(Chorus)
i dont wanna argue i mean yes i wanna argue
im like no i dont wanna argue

To me, to me love is no go
Till fiddle and oboe start weeping, and wailing
That's my failing
He may be all wrong for me
But his is the only song for me
I know he's around when the sky and the ground start in ringing
I know he is near
By the thunder I hear in advance
His words, his words alone
Are the words that can start my heart singing
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance
He'll sleep and he'll rise
In the light of two eyes that adore him
And bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance
In every way, every day
I need less of myself and more him, more him
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance
In every way, every day
I need less of myself and more him, more him
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance
His is the only music that makes me dance

This is self defense. x2
This ain't no threat man, ???
This is self defense
Ain't no tough guy talk,
we're just doing what we have to
[Verse 1 - Iriscience]
I think ya better let it go
You need attention? I send medical
Basically you're trying to harm me, you're crazy
Musically, I'm blazin'. Physically, I'm gracy
Triangle choke ya
And what the fuck could have provoked ya?
We don't know eachother kid, and I did not insult ya
Don't make me feed the fish, feed the trees, or feed the vultures
I don't know stones, I throw statues and sculptures
I block flows with strikes and strikes with blows
I slice flows with my mic (get showns)?
I counterattack and turn the tables in an instant
Move out of range and step into close distance
Resistance, relax with less friction
Leverage and technique bring jokes and submissions
You got heart, you plan to make it happen
But none of my family are chumps or never have been
Respect mine, protect myself at all times
Build twice next time before you cross the line
I guess this is what you call a turn of events
And the best offense is a good defense
[Chorus]
Yo, you want to hit us? We can hit back
If you talk that talk, you got's to live that. (This is self defense)
Whenever you front out, you gonna get back. (This is self defense)
Self Defense, you wish you never did that. (This is self defense)
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Evidence]
Yo, stay ready for the worst
Paranoid, straight, smart
enemies hit ya where you think you're safe. (Self Defense)
I cut my fingerprints with razor blades
I'm in the cut, the kind you don't recognize with shades
Tattoos, learn two tricks
only thing between me and the borders and the straight face
Answers to questions, four eye contact
this confrontation ain't physical, but still combat
Leave ya'self left with options to choose
The last line of defense of my crew, (dope rules?)
Psychic, precise, right and exact for songs
Only time we've been wrong is when we thought we were wrong
The science are format's own conclusive, but peace first and war, last.
These words are crucial
Conflict resolved, but to those that want to brawl:
Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional
Also, dropping the ball ain't recommended
when life or death decisions are made within seconds
Of course we make the right ones, strategically through
Self defense, but not by myself. Babu
[Chorus]
(Scratching "Self defense is a must" by DJ Babu)

Thanks a bunch for staying with us tonight
Over lunch, we'll talk about the lights
I need to go now, I need to drive round
I need to lie down
Thanks i'm stunned it's time to go
I promise you're my best friend
Then in the end, that wont make it so
I need to go now, I need to drive round
I need to lie down
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Thanks thanks a lot, we love you all
Thanks, please thank your Mums
'cause you are the best that we've ever known
I need to go now, I need to drive round
I need to lie down
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Every time I hear you I feel lonesome on a cloud
Every time I see you I feel happy and around
I need to lie down
I need to go now, I need to lie down
My heads in a spin, the state that I'm in
I need to go now
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about
Probably notice you're probably worth it, just about

Oh, my goodness
What have I done (oh no)
I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world
In my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs
Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebbecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector
I said nice rectum
I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector in the guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya
They said once bitten n twice shy
We lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser
It's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester
Drop, kick the bits before a second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and were does it all end

How should I begin it and were does it all end
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends
All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the teeth and showin' up
So you better change the station
To keep from throwin' up
Man you seen it all before your alter a million with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't
I won right by the Pussy Cat Dolls "When call you kitten"
I'll pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room
Crazy glue in Madonna to
The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine if visual for that man
Who woulda thought
Could ever be such a relentless prick
And leashin' his fingers
For the chicks who waltz
She looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be
Your so sensitive
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and were does it all end

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and knee him right into quick sand

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
I've been through mad different phases like mazes, to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doing something more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there
Now I'ma there sit back and look
At what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit the drama with my Mama
She got on some fly shit so I split
And said that I'ma be that seed
That doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed
And a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Bagging niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Going too fast, it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions, prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man
When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be living high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only muthafucka I had offered my last
Just another little nigga headed nowhere fast
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
That ain't the half shit get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit starting shit for kicks
Catching Vicks throwing bricks gettin by being slick
Used to get high to get by used to have to puff my L
In the morning before I get fly
Ate something a couple of forties made me hate something
I did some coke now I'm ready to take something
Three years later showing signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side living the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fucking it up
I'm slippin', I'm falling, I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talking shit was like damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window
No more endo
Look at a video
Sayin' to myself that could've been yo
Ass on the TV
Believe me, it could be done
Something's got to give
Gots to change cause I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back looking type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothing but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doing wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is yo fucking song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit you'll get yours because it's due
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

What you say hammer? Proper
Where are the real women? (8x)
This raps grand national
Dj Quik and Jon B
I ain't down to Earth I'm in a stratus and I love it
Too many broke haters in the city not above it
Yea I'm self-made, that's a scholar
If you didn't listen one in one thousand gettin' free
Where is your tuition
I think I need a maid
Cuz I'm kinda? gettin' paid
And I don't feel like cleanin' up
I'm going through a phase
So I look for all my days
To be enjoyed with a women like me so..
Where are the real women?
Show me the real women
Where are the real women?
Show me the real women
I drink Kelly Green? in water guess it's somethin' bout the bubbles
Do you want the simple life or do you want trouble?
Do you want the hood or do you want the good?
And don't you wanna be treated like classy women should?
No imitation Louie Diamonds like Club Louie
Closet overflowin' all Jimmy Choo's jewelry
Float you like a buoy
Spend without a limit
I'm seeking out the women that other women mimic
So Proper
I need a proper girl
Proper love
Proper touch

Proper style

And all of you got ya flaws
We wont make that an issue
I take you to the mall and hold this Louie purse against you
See how it match your shoes and how it change ya mood
All your girlfriends perceive me as a really player dude

And leave you hella happy that's exactly what I do

[Slug]
I had a rough day, but that's life, it happens
Woke up on a dark side of my mattress
I guess I forgot to set my clock
Overslept, almost lost the job
Then to top it off, I'm kinda hungry
But can't eat till I find my money
It's in my wallet but my wallet ain't in my pocket
Can't remember the last time I saw it
And they don't want me in a bad mood
Afraid that it'll spread and everyone will catch an attitude
They got 'em all singing the same tone
Thinking I should go and start a fire in the break room
Co-workers make me sick
and the manager really ain't shit
But I can't quit, so I'm hiding in the basement
Holding onto to my face like fuck this place
[Chorus: 2X]
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play
[Slug]
Hell naw, I ain't going to school
The teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
and all the kids mess with each other always all day
Class warfare up and down the hallways
And if you ain't popular
Nobody talks to ya, unless they mocking ya
Not even bus driver or the hall monitor
I might as well climb inside my locker huh
It's a bad day, bad week and a bad month
Don't nobody want to trade with my bag lunch
Someday I'ma be so cool
But for now I got cheap shoes, so I keep losing
Girls give no love to a poor man
It's a prison, the clock is warden
Man it won't get no better when I get home
So I listen to the voice in my headphones
[Chorus: 2X]
[Slug]
Can't dance with an upset stomach
The overdraft notices just kept coming
Somebody broke into the porch and stole a chair
Top of your head stopped growing hair
Broken glass, computer crashed
The car won't start and the tires went flat
Dog got loose, brought back a dead cat
Daughter found it and had a panic attack
Plus you ain't had sex in how long?
Afraid to admit that the fire's all gone
The better half is talking about separate
You wish you could take it back to yesterday
You not alone, it's hard as hell
But don't waste no time feeling sorry for self
We'll be right here with you through your war
Cause you're the one that we make this music for
Now turn it up
[Chorus: 2X]

[Verse 1]
Let 'em speak, I know I'm meek but the mils louder
Watch the throne, kings kill when the prince feels power
It's the real deal, Holyfield, holy shit, holy grail
Silver spoon coon, young buffoon, yeah, they know me well
I'm makin' moves, couldn't lose, doin' Parker Lewis
Hot on my own, self-immolate, I could be a Buddhist
Hot on my own, check your tone, check your stance homie
You don't even like me, you just trynna get my fans homie
So nerdy but the flow wordy
Brain-freezin' with the flow slurpie
Ice cold but you know I burn cash like I had herpes
Not true, but I'm that dirty
Niggas quit bein' hot man, cold turkey
While I'm out in Kauai, man, soul searchin'
And these niggas be afraid and I'm so certain
Cause they don't know what to do when the world's broken
A lot of people try and go and talk shit but your girl stops me on the street
Like it's stop and frisk and a bunch of DDots wanna talk a lot of shit
But that's cool cause in the real world they really don't exist
It's all because the internet
Chance made millions, Haim made millions
Dan made millions, Kendrick made millions
I would too if I wasn't in my feelings
[Interlude]
You know, cause like, people say money's not everything
But money, you need money to do what you wanna do
Like money is power, honesty is power, truth is power
But at the same time they tell you like
[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
You ain't really eatin' boy, you gotta get your food up
We so steady eatin' baby, you already know that
The way I'm droppin' new shit, I'm sittin' on the toilet
Every night I tour that, moment
But we don't take pictures, when you're rich you just see it again
The only thing they really worry about is me and the pen
Wrote some shit on Instagram, I'm just bein' honest
They tried to give your boy pills like I'm bein' violent
They tried to give your boy pills just to keep him silent
Keep tellin' people the truth, you could be iconic
They tried to give your boy pills, like "he's scarin' us"
Try to stay inside, I don't really like appearances
I try to stay inside, but they still got something to say
"Are you still on the show? Are you dating Jhené?"
It's deeper than that
Calico inside the handbag, I'm keepin' the cat
I got some niggas in reserve like I'm deep in Iraq
And I'm deep in the rap, and it's deeper than rap
This is deeper than rap

[Intro]
(Soulo taught me...)
See yea my nigga see
See yes this where sci-fi meets swag
Like the Holy Bible in a Gucci Bag
[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Oh you the kid, I'm Joseph Kony
Chip off the block, since puffy socks in my Saucony
I touch stock, she suck cock
She dancing Secret Sundays and I'm 'bout to pray
I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
She got that magical vaginal let me hocus poke
Row, row, row my boat gently down your stream
She into Alexander McQueen but she ain't met the king
(Soulo, SOULO, Soulo, SOULO) kiss the fucking ring ho
TDE we got the belt, "hold it down if nothin else"
And this is my new single, cut the cheese it's bout to melt
Lean in my cup, pinky up like Dr.Evil
Currently we seeing deeds like Adam Sandler
ScHoolboy Q, OG, and dirty pineapple Fanta
And I ain't never been a motherfucking lick 'less I'm right around the clit
Druggys wit' hoes, O's and 4's
[Hook x2]
I'm smokin dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag so mean, on them fucking hoes
[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Oh that's your bitch? Well bruh she on me
I made her lick my sack, then work the top, then fuck the homies
Got the block hot, 'cuz I set it off
No I'm not Weezy, bitch I'm wheezy from that chronic cough
Yeah, I'm smoking dope, you can smell it in my beard
Have no fear, saviour of the gangster rap is fucking here
Word around town, SOPA tryna shut it down
How that sound I'm from the underground
They're gonna make me slang a pound
Figg Row (Figg Row) Figg Row (Figg Row)
Bitch, what you know about Figg Row (Figg Row)
This is original gangster, Uh, uh, uh, yeah
Smoke it, shoot it, sniff it, smell it
Inhale it, sip it, whatever
Just mix dope with your flavor uh, uh, uh, yeah
In interviews they always asking me about a list
Knowing damn well I'm looking like I'm slinging bricks
Ever see an ex-student get a half a ticket
Think I'm lying, just ask Jimmy, that check was mine as soon as we signed
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q]
Soulo ho! Groovy Q!
I'm high as fuck, nigga me too
Won't pass the weed, but I'll pass a bitch
Fendi on, I might throw a fit
Deadline, hoodie on like Trayvon
Heard it through the grapevine
We got extra pills, lean and shrooms
Life for me is just weed and brews
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it)

Yeah
Bust how we gonna bounce off this ninety-five soul assassins
Cypress hill joint.
Yo we want everybody out there to throw their hands up...
...so get it on kid!
Fresh is the word, when i display my rappin forte
Quicker done than o.j., hey

Stress me out, no doubt, i might have to blast ya
Let me ask ya, can i gets busy one time?
And unwind and chill, with cypress hill
Huh, i go on with my bad self
I'm the four pound toter, the phil blunt smoker
Believe me not, i'm wicked like three sixes
I'm doper than the pete rock remixes
Never walk through the crowd sluggish
I'm hardcore to the bone, i'm thuggish ruggish
The green-eyed, bandit, i be errrick serrrmon
I gets real determined
And one for the trouble, and two for the bass
I take it to your face with this here lyrical mace
And if you don't know, why'all better recognize
I'm coming through with speed, with pounds of weed
Ahh shit, another one of those gangsta hits
Niggaz want to get busy with the ultimate
Fools get real, yo i'm representin the hill
With chips and clips and tons of blue steel
So who wants to be the first nigga to die?
Then try and test this, buddha blessed gemini
You get thrown sent home in a coffin
Punk stuff don't make it back, very often
I got erick to take care of the sermon
Ashes to ashes, dust, bodies burnin
Bustin open the doors to the temple
Takin you to the dark side of your mental
[Chorus: b-real]
Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air
Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air
[Chorus]
I rhyme tricky, the sticky smoka with the mind itchy
Finger up on the pen, be like "he the bomb, dicky!"
These off-keys mc's hawk me, they won't get off me
So i kill em softly and use em as walkie talkies *bzzzzt*
Turn up my level adjust my voice pitch
Hoist this diagnosis, comatosis
Is what i leave your crew with, boom bip or some two and two shit
Raw silk, 'cause you do it to my music
*funk doctor spock* lock the hypest
Individual, to put criminal in diapers
With my nigga e and cypress, what i write bitch
You swore, it was a nuclear war, crisis
In your back yard, word to god, def squad!
With my nigga keith in the place takin charge
Word up you'll get hurt up like the jury callin murder
You're deaf 'cause i freak shit you neva heard of
[Chorus]
Steppin to the park in the hill you can't hang
The original baby gangsta on this compton thang
Don't slip, the late night hype, is when i dip
Boo-yaa is the sound from a lonely clip
Can't feel me, if i was crack you'd try to steal me
Heard you, and your little crew, want to peel me
Keep your hands on your hood, you get got
The green-eyed bandit, cypress hill, and the funk doctor spock
You wish you could hang, like i hang
Dwells in the see-p-t, the hood thing

Hit you, the tech 9, i'ma split you
Ain't no poppin, no stoppin
Tick to the tock, tick tock i hit your block
Throw your hands in the air, don't bite this
I squeeze, nigga please, the e down with cypress
[Chorus]
[Outro: Sen Dog]
Alright, for everybody
All our peeps out on the corners
All the alleyways
For all our decesed
Incarcerated peeps, brothers on the streets
Nineteen ninety-five
Soul assassins in your mind

I jumped out the bed
Flat iron my hair
But in our true religion
I'm so far from pigeon
And I hit the closet
Throw on my juicy coaches
Rock my shirt and my bra
Then head straight to the shake draw
Botaga, Veneta, Valentino, Gucci, Carde Air, Marc Jacobs, Prada
Dependin' on how I feel today
Please believe I'm always chumped out
Stay up on my shade game

We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, burn round while the sun beaming
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, level with these palm trees
I wanna be cuter than the Newport
Pimping like we too short
King of my sidewalk, chilling like a true lord
Dreaming of the hills, what you fucking up my view for?
Bopping up the floors out the Capetown
Niggas stop, but we ain't chasing nothing off Baywatch
On these roller wheels, bitches with the brakes off
Refuge, hustles with the G's to the OZ's
One day we'll be level with the palm trees
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, burn round while the sun beaming
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, level with these palm trees
Level with the palm trees,
I wanna be leaning down the one ten
Faded with the sunset
Never stress a chain, we a trick away from success
Kicking in like Cortez, sipping on the porches
Overlook my fortress, southern Cali gorgeous
Down with everybody like a local weed dealer
Dreams of tropic cans you stole some premium tequilas
Refuge, hustles with the G's to the OZ's
One day we'll be level with the palm trees
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, burn round while the sun beaming
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, level with these palm trees
Level with the palm trees
Inhale, exhale, level with the angels
Rolling with my head high, further from the pavement
On another level, on another level
Inhale, exhale, level with the angels
Rolling with my head high, further from the pavement
On another level, on another level
On, on, on another level
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, burn round while the sun beaming
We level, top down with my crew coasting
We level, level with these palm trees
Level with the palm trees

Straight thug, nigga, most of my life spent
Was on that black top working that white, bitch
Shit, it was just 500 for the zip then
Got a plug and my homeboy chipped in
I was gunning, seventeen when I bagged up
Pyrex, work yo mo'fuckin' wrist in
Turnt up to be turnt down
It's what the kush for, let's get burnt down
I've got a muddy cup of that Texas dope
And that good smoke from that Oaktown, bitch
100 pounds of the good, what it cost?
Hit 'em with the ski mask, they get lost
I don't trick on these hoes
But I will pay your broke bitch to back up off me
Drop them drawers, ho, fuck all that talking
House on my neck, I call that balling
True shit, it ain't shit like a new bitch
My old hoes, I don't call that often
Drop them drawers, ho, fuck all that talking

Hurry up, let me beat it, though
When she ask me to eat it

Cause this pimping shit in my bones
Million cash on my mind, bitch
Snowflakes on that stove, dope fiends on my line, bitch
Straight hand to hand, east side, on my land I'm the man
Learned how to chef up them cookies
Gotta let 'em just dry by the fan
We keep that chopped up in plastic
Gotta find a new place to stash it
Once I ran through my pack
Hit the club, balled out like a draft pick
Keep that chopped up in plastic
Gotta find a new place to stash it
Once I ran through my pack
Hit the club, balled out like a draft pick

If I could write one song to right all wrongs, I would, if I could
But in retrospect a little bad is good, mm, hmm
We all do what we want and don't know what we need, mm, mm
Life is good 'til three then bittersweet indeed, mm, hmm
Well, I'm so human, it is a goddamn shame, I'm your thing
And I'm not sure that I'll always keep us in pain, yes sir
And to remind you of that I'll survive somehow, oh
And with freedom that I can still be your man right now and now
'cause I wanna hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?
Live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Now hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?
Live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Just live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Well, I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive
Said stand up, everybody, uh, this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters
The lovers who ain't here
You only got one life, y'all, and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going
Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
'cause ignorance is bliss and ignorance is just so fucking ignorant
You may even be ignorant of this
If you say so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin', still fuckin', so fools don't make a dish
Light a candle for love, blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish
'cause I wanna hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?
Live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Now hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?
Live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Just live
(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)
Well, I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive
Well, I have struggled so hard, yet I survive
And a little miracle that I'm still alive

You got it (baby)
You got it (uh-huh)
Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from Shaolin
Stood by my side when my world was caved in
She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy
Every time she told me she loved me, I said "no" back
Since I was fucked up in the game, migraines
No honey in pockets, all I had was the change
Forty-five feelings, they got the beef
I through the heat to my dome
She said "If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone"
Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong
Our bond is even more stronger when the night is gone
Say, "Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water running
Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven"
And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion
And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em
Whose asking, your still has come
Stay focused, keep it cool, you know I love you
Love you too, babe, thank you
(you out there) you got it (louder)
The more I drowned, the more down he went
As if to say, them other chicks wasn't meant
When she came through, by every square inch possible
Help the kid get on out, every obstacle
Long talks at night, arguments and still try'nna solve
Whether who is right, we mad tight
And the way she, never call the cops on a nigga
Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body
My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop
Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot
Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure
Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more
Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie
Look you dead in the eye
Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest
I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas
You got it
I was down in the sea of love
Going down to a clear cloud
You came and saved me dear (saved me) (Ghostface!)
It's too bad you didn't do it, I ain't never been used to it
The way we stopped them, dear (stopped them dear)
To all the ladies who love they man
Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in
Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em
Out of love, doing juks for them
To all my ladies who love a girl with good brains on 'em
Baggin' to get your name tattooed on 'em
Kiss 'em in the morning, hold 'em, definitely show 'em
We got our crab down, packed when it's time to mold 'em
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh,
(you out there) you got it (louder)
I was down, thank you

Baby Girl

Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with
They thought luck did it, but it didn't cause I'm back again

Sliding in from the front, never way behind
Niggas wonder how I came with this style of mine
Remain in your seats as I release the clip into yo' hip

As we give you motherfuckers just what you want
Lay on back, light up the blunts

It's all love
I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
curried falafel, barbecued tofu
no fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
exercising daily to stay healthy
and I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy
Lentil soup is mental fruit
and ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh veg-e-table with the mayatl stew
sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
careful how you season and prepare your foods
cause you don't want to lose vitamins and miner-ules
and that's the jewel
life brings life, it's valuable, so I eat what comes
from the ground, it's natural
let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
no Excederin (uh uh)
strictly herb, generate in the sun, cause I got melanin
and drink water, eight glasses a day
cause that's what they say
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
my goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
we got to start taking better care of ourselves
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy

To never go no further, than my soul allows
All on my own, I was blind to see
You hypnotized me, I was lost, now I've awakened
The stone was just sand, now I'm a man

Give thanks and breathe it in.
'Cause we're blessed.
Blessed to have another moment,
Some more time spent,
Some more minds to get into.
Blessed to have another daydream,
Another maybe,
Yeah.
Forget the bang or the reload,
The efforts to decode,
This life is a long road,
The objects to be bold,
The lessons are retold,
The prophets are resold,
The mercy is so cold,
We service the download.
So right this down now,
Brand new sound now,

Blessed to have another moment,
Some more time spent,
Some more minds to get into.
Blessed to have another daydream,
Another maybe,
Yeah.

The barters and the bargaining,
The movers and the sitting in,
The wheel it out and come again.

Knowing what will be will be,
We giving you a melody,
Marketing a harmony.

To say what I have to say.
Granted that I still remain.
To share what is my song.
Blessed to have another moment,
Some more time spent,
Some more minds to get into.
Blessed to have another daydream,
Another maybe,
Yeah.

Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Yeah we're still here now
We're still
Basic or Asic
I ain't tryna waste this
Took a long time cryin', cryin' ain't a crime
I got my mom, she passed away, my daddy ain't alive
Before they murdered Fudge I prayed for more time
Had y'all on my mind all week
I missed the last
They say a better tomorrow is to sacrifice the calf
Keep that cow in the pasture, knife in the drawer
It's been a long 40 days, it's gonna take 40 more
Make it through losin' love, sorta like rock few
I made the limits, I thought that I run the gas out
When you took your last breath, I only passed out
Laid in the better place but that left me ass out
Hearin' that voice goin' dependent on memory
Space is vacant now and I need that energy
Fake to perfection flesh, I should be thankful
From neck to ankle I'm physically thankful
Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Yeah we're still here now
We're still
Dreams
Out of eternal dreams comes delusion
(Cause we're still here now)
Ride into our teaser Rolls-Royce, brown
You silver shadow yeah
(We're still)
Order now beers and wine and if the bar stool's empty
(Cause we're still here now)
And time is a dogma you can't escape
You can't escape, you can't escape
You think you know it, careful what you search for
Stare it in the face
(We're still)
Seasick on Pacific swell
I did it to myself
Stare it in the face
Next day radiant blue
How you gonna recognize it?
Think he cried more than me
How you gonna let go?
Watcha lookin at, just starin' at his face
How, how, how, how will you ever know?
Just lookin' at, starin' at his face
How will you ever know?
Think he cried more than me
Starin' at his face
Hey, ah, how will you ever know?
Starin' at his face
(Out here the only one)
How will you ever know?
How will you ever know?
Starin' at his face
Instead I hear your voice
I hear your voice
With me
With the way
Gone for now but here to stay
But here to stay
I will always place your memory
For now

[Intro: DJ Motor Mane]
Yea, we out in Cali
We gon' take you to the Bay Area real quick
My man Berner, smoking good weed
Counting that cash, you already know
[Verse 1]
When I get drunk around the bitch I get to preaching
Without some money or some smoke I get to tweaking
I party all weekend, and I don't ever sleep
I get up and get to straight to the garden and set seeds
Taking bout cash I need a big brown bag
I got bitches that'll get big money that wanna strip for me
Gold chain big tummy and my click hungry
30 round clip, they ain't taking shit from me
I'm a Bay Area boy, she wanna marry ya boy
She need to pay me some more
I been all around the world like Biggie
My OG's pop seeds they got in the 60's
The F1 Durb got the club all pussy
They got money on my head come and get me
Shout out to the Dogg, we be high, burning Lemon
I'm Taylor Gang repping I been on since '07
[Chorus]
Yea, we blow dope money
I got pretty blonde girls that'll hoe for me
I got land in the hills, we get money for reals
Yea, I still got it for the low homie
Yea, we spend blow money
I was all around the city getting hoe money
I got land in the hills we get money for reals
Yea, I still got it for the low homie
[Verse 2]
I got it for the low, if they hate Big Bern' they got to go
I was only 16 when I learned how to grow
It ain't nothing like the weed game, baby
Dawg these renegade bitches better, pay me
I'm on the 80 doing 80
They say I'm crazy I'm just grumpy at times, when the pills get me lazy
Lemonade tasty, yea I'm Max B wavy
I ain't flexed yet, I just burned 380 on jewels
And a big blue pool I'm old school
I don't talk on the phone, I just know how to move
Dog they don't touch work they just front on the net
I keep talking on the burner catch one to the neck
Bay boy, real 'Frisco shit
We get money off the girl you tryna kiss that bitch
And I ain't even trying let em lie
On my name brought that one that play with fire(?)
[Chorus]
Yea, we blow dope money
I got pretty blonde girls that'll hoe for me
I got land in the hills, we get money for reals
Yea, I still got it for the low homie
Yea, we spend blow money
I was all around the city getting hoe money
I got land in the hills we get money for reals
Yea, I still got it for the low homie
[Outro: Berner]
You know I still move around, you know what I'm talking bout
People talking bout I changed, psh
Still doing the same thing man, picking up paper bags, man

Wiz whats up boy, haha, all the suckers tho

[Chorus]
Yea, we blow dope money
I got pretty blonde girls that'll hoe for me
I got land in the hills, we get money for reals
Yea, I still got it for the low homie
Yea, we spend blow money
I was all around the city getting hoe money
I got land in the hills we get money for reals
Yea, I still got it for the low homie

Yup, yup, yeah.. uhh..
Yeah..
All night like a corner store, twenty-four seven
Hood hanger; we gets hot like a wok
in the Chinese kitchen, switchin up on my shoe wear
How we get down, we blew down, nigga big bank style
Sit and chill a while, wait a minute yo we blows big nigga
Sip on bottles with funny names, holla holla
Deep in this thang, keep it simple and plain
and watch my chain hang, watch my chain hang
Listen here -- I got a book that you should read
It's about me, and I suggest that to any nigga who doubt me
it will correct you, affect you, it will make shit clear
Now switch to the next nigga with that bullshit here
Keep readin -- it will also say
that if you, disrespect, anything up in this way
that will guaran-tay an awesome array of gunplay, okay?
This is Carlito's Way, all day
Shake it shake it shake it shake it hang out all night
and don't stop until the DJ quit spinnin what's right
Everybody sweatin gettin closer and closer, be shoulder to shoulder
Bouncin, bouncin, we tipsy, danceflo' is slippery
But we groovin, keepin this bitch movin
Provin, we bang in this game watch my chain hang
Back and forth, back, and forth
Style, whatchu know bout ridin out
from the Kroger parking lot to the Paramount
and Birmingham then back, punk is spittin his jack
When the leaves turn ur-ange, and you see your breath
uhh, fifteen eleven colossal
I'm weighing in at a Knighton
If you don't know nuthin else
believe that it is some ol' real niggaz
Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang
Lyric assassin while mashin they blastin come fast and
scatter from every rational imaginal
International region, under my seeds and, over these airwaves
Manipulate the rhyme with my mind so it's good to grind
through your speaker, this one's a keeper
Like Ebenezer, it was his decision, to live his life
through a tunnel vision, followed by the reaper
who knows your past deeper, don't let him creep ya, from behind
Before I was rudely interrupted, house fallin down
but we straight, you should save yourself ??
It's rainin suckers cause they greed sickens me
Poverty stricken, hand pickin, in the corner cleansin
Lights out poor, slip and you nails hell
Everythang for sale, be eat with they plastic
Let's enhance it, I'll be good til Saturday
Thick volume gravity
We bout to mix and mingle, meet a match for the next single
Money stashed away in jars like Pringles
Keep it hard for the Tunnel, we make it bump
for the 5 5 nina skull-cap boot-wearin renegade motherfuckers
Throw yo' hands up, you give it up we give it back
Yo, this is how we act when it's packed from the back
Lady don't snatch, let my chain hang
Everythang is everythang boo
Behold, the stolen soul, the ancient scroll
The game of control, roll the Swisher swoll
Open the gate away, lay to lay, I getcha gotcha greaterly
Even when you hate me, you educate me
So try to trill, I will take ya to the battlefield
Crack your motherfuckin, windshield you better yield
cause I got the right of way, night or day, alright okay
This is Carlito's Way
Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang
Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang

Straight out the cage - learn ya lesson
Yo, studio sessions are not shows
Learn ya lesson - in shows and studios
This here breath controls all I got to lose
But the architects respect it - live in House of Blues
Flow for my peeps - that's true
You know we take it live on stage

Thirty bucks a ticket?

Like when you take a homeless man and you promise him land
Understand I rock for Dilated
The longer you wait, longer you get violated
If words was notes, I say it the way Miles play it
I know my styles hated - you can't get nowhere near it
Instead of investin' in hate, you should invest in merit
Look at yourself, you monstrosity of hypocrisy
Tryin' to be the king of media, you the king of mediocrity
Chop your flow, disposable, like heroes of the prophecy
I got the evidence that me and Rock know how to flow properly

I know that I was not the one
To let my feelings show
In any way that mattered
The moment I felt
She might mean something to me
I would just run away
I felt that love was for the fool
Would tarnish any jewel
Turn a diamond to simple coal
Because in all my life
I never met that someone to make me feel love was right, alright
[Chorus]
Now I'll do most anything for you
To bring your love
Back into my empty world
You're the only girl I'm thinking of
Though I'll never know why you left this way
I'll try to understand
'Cause the moment you wee in my life
Made me better than I am
Now I see how issues from the past
Can manfest themselves
In your feelings for others
My bitter heart would poison loving souls of those
Who tried to come too close
And then you came into my life
And filled me with the strength
To face the pain inside me
Now that I've given you
The best part of my heart
I see you have your issues too
Your issues too
[Chorus]
Better than I am
I'm better than I am
Though I'll never know why you left this way
I'll try to understand
'Cause the moment you were in my life
Made me better than I am


If I aint in your top 5, you def or you cockeyed
But as soon as my stock rise, you niggas gon' cock ride
Who you know got ties with gangstas that chop pies
I swear these are not lies, my verses will scare you if I took you counter-clockwise

Bumpin' the

West coast ridin'
In the flyest two seater
With the fast low leader
So the hood's over heated
Candy painted whip
Doin' kisses on tip
I'm a lowridin' ruler
Burnin' rubber with my chick
On a California roll
Double 0 to 6-4

Legs up

We ain't riding on blades
And I needn't all change
You ain't never seen nothin'
You just ridin' our way
And that's why I'm gonna stay with ya

Better step, to the side
Cause I'm gunnin' for the prize
I'm the number one contender here
To make the girl, mine
She's a diva, not a skeezer
Just a hot, senorita
And she makes my heart thump
Like some twenty-inch speakers
Once you wrapped around my arm
You could be my lucky charm
I'm a certified, pimp
And I got it goin' on
I'm addicted to you, girl
Need my fix, everyday
I ain't tryin' to rehab
Got you runnin' through my veins

If you can feel what I'm feeling then it's a musical masterpiece
Hear what I'm dealing with then that's cool at least
What's running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk and this is me, y'all
An M.C., y'all my name is M.C.A. and I still do what I please
And now I'd like to introduce (what's up?)
I'll pass the mic to D for a fistful of truth
The name is D, y'all, and I don't play
And I can rock a block party 'till your hair turns grey
(So, what you sayin'?) I explode on site
I'm like Jimmy Walker, I'm (dy-no-mite!)
And now I'd like to pass the mic
To Adrock, c'mon and do anything you like
I'm the A-D-R-O-C-K, in the place with the bass, I'm going all the way
I can't stop y'all, tock-tick, y'all
And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick y'all
'Cause I'ma turn it in and I'ma turn it out
But for now I've got to pass the mic to Yauch
Well, on and on and on and on
I can't stop, y'all, 'till' the early morn'
So rock-rock, y'all, tick-tock y'all, to the beat, y'all
To the beat, y'all, c'mon and rock, y'all
I give thanks for inspiration, it guides my mind along the way
A lot of people get jealous, they're talking about me
But that's just 'cause they haven't got a thing to say
Well, everybody rapping like it's a commercial
Actin' like life is a big commercial
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
And now I'd like to pass the mic to the A
(So what's your name, yauch?) my name is M.C.A
I've been coming to where I am from the get-go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
And now I'd like to pass the mic
To my brother Adrock, c'mon and shine like a light
Yes, yes, y'all and yes, yes, y'all
I'm always on time, nevertheless, y'all
And that's right, y'all
I shed light, y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight, y'all
So what you gonna say that I don't know already?
I'm like Clyde and I'm rockin' steady
But time flies when you're having fun, so Mike D (that's me!)
C'mon and get some
M-I-K-E to the D
You come and see me and you pay your fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Now Adrock (huh?) and M.C.A (yeah?)
Let's rock this joint in the old school way
Well, I'm on 'till the crack of dawn
Mowing down M.C.'s like I'm mowing the lawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
You think we'll ever meet Stevie?
(One of these days, D!)
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an M.C who acts like a clown
But for now, I'd like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowd?

Oh yeah, ooh
I know every now and then
We will have our problems
I know sometimes we won't see
Eye to eye, baby
Don't think I'm gonna sit here and
Let you turn away
'Cause happy is where I want to make you, so I gotta know
[Chorus]
Tell me can we conversate
So we can get to learn each other
I don't think that we should wait
If this is a forever thing
I know we made a few mistakes
And in return we hurt each other
We really need to conversate
If this is a forever thing
At first I wasn't serious
About you and me
And in return me and my boys
Played the field ran the street
Because of you I've changed the
Man in me, I'm sincere
Now happy is what we gotta be so I gotta know
[Chorus]
Love was right in front of me
I was so blind baby I couldn't see
Now I really know for sure
Now I'm ready to be serious
[Chorus until end]

[Verse 1]
Baby, why you gotta do me this way (this way)
Baby, why you gotta take love away (away)
Girl you so cold, South Pole's where you reside
And you take, take, take thats how you survive
But its over, its getting warmer
I ain't playing with ya, cuz its over
[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know what you want
But you ain't gonna get it (ohhh-ohh)
You try all you want
But you aint gonna get it (ohhh-ohh)
Whatever you do, I can do it better
I can do it better than you (I can do it better)
[Verse 2]
Baby, why you tryna change up the game (the game)
(Baby) Baby, don't think I picked out your ways (your ways)
Girl you so cold, South Pole's where you reside
And you take, take, take thats how you survive
But its over, its getting warmer
I ain't playing with ya, cuz its over
[Chorus]
Whatever you do, I can do it better
I can do it better than you (I can do it better)
[Chorus]
Whatever you do, I can do it better
I can do it better than you (I can do it better)
I can do it better..
I can do it better..

They hip hop was gone, than everybody moaned
I'ma pick it up where it left off and respawn
it's like being reborn, eat the crack, drink wine
for those that can't see it, I give sight to the blind
call it audio abuse I take it each time
thats why a lot of these rappers on a rapid decline
I'm on my Master P grind no time to be a Romeo
I love the ladies but success is a lonely road
as I hold, I'm what half of y'all aint
I got Micky D pockets and Caviar tastes
does it matter, y'all tatted on half of y'all face
to appeal to look real when half of y'all fake
faker than a 1000 dollar bills with Obama face on it
you rappers dont want it, I'm on it
my competition gon get shut down like the Source
this is entrepreneur music, I'm a young boss
all I do is floss all the way across the nation
not only in New York but wherever I vacating
never really taken days off, paper chasing
shows stay packed and venues is never vacant
lyrically I'm a menace, call me old dog
put all of these rappers careers in the morgue
ha,ha,ha,ha, I'm just so appalled at the way these n-ggas rapping
now I know I can cruch em all
I'm a young icon in the making, destined for greatness
now watch these rappers start hating
when I'm around nobody matter,
man, I'm there mother, there girl and there daughters favorite rapper
make way for the youth, I got the medicine man
diggy looking like he the truth
yeah I'm motion picture, my life is a movie, I do this

Yo, hey yo, I step out the shell like a black pearl
But come to destroy you of all worlds
I eat you inside out like stress
The best, I never lose a rhyme contest
While troublesome black rolls flows
Bleed internal external like a bloody nose
Props grow like crops
Desert boot Clarks wit no socks
Parking space killer stay out my lot
You hear my voice, you see my face, you know my name
I take it out your ass and charge it to the game
I battle with words, go to war with ideas
You defeat me never in a million years
The factor of the rapture
Is that you either get killed, wound, or captured
They shoot you up so bad til the end you fought
But then you got caught up in my final thought

I could gaffle Mr. Keebler for all his Chips Ahoy out the chalk Town House
Give you static like your mixer got the ground out
Hug you wit my hands in your grandmas pouch
I'm down south wit Outkast wit pounds out
Wicked enough to throw the gun in James Bond mouth
You know E and Keith when we brawl
I be in more hoods than that big fork and spoon on your kitchen wall
And overall, on y'all a protocal
My style is Kabal, finish him
For the Benjamins
Fools call me the Grinch
Cause I punch you in your face Christmas on two fifth
While the cops watch the Jamaican hide pot
When I stomp I leave the shoe size of Sasquatch
Miss Thing there is no guest list tonight
[ Erick Sermon ]
Yo, yo
Its E the assassin ANTONIO BANDERAS
Catch a few of my enemies by the bodegas
So face it, some of y'all should go back to basics
Before the prom, before Sissy Spacik
Reevaluate what's right for you
From the start or was it something you wanted to do fucker
I dig a hole so deep you can't return
And hear about the episode on Howard Stern
I'm born wit heart I blast ya
Hit ya wit the fishing deep water and take your yacht master
Playing me one time that's unforgivin
I got a body one count and we ain't bullshittin
We be thick in the mix, milk wit Quik
In the business I work every circuit
I'm bigger, better, and deafer
So however, wherever, whenever, heffer
Miss Thing there is no guest list tonight ( 4x )

[Tek]
To all my peeps locked down, comin back 2 life
I know it's been a mega zone, since I sen't you this kite
But I had to K.I.M., you know the city don't sleep
Put 50 cents in your commisary, reach you next week
The streets still in a shangle, since we last broke bread
And Baby Ra got left, O.T. two in the head
Seen Black cop the ack, you know his numbers ain't match
He still runnin tack jobs from the days of way back
And look at Jose, is wild now, gave birth to my first child
And they move John back to the Isle
Still tryin to hold my dough to see mom straight
Gotta scribe from Jahard said he maxed a rapper's weight
For a rep to 5-10, before we lock in
Askin how's my rappin, wanna know if I'm still boxin
In the center that's the sum, now he been gone for 12 summers
Round the same time a vapor leather b bombers
[scratched up samples of Mobb Deep's "Trife Life"]
[Tek]
For the love of money, Red is facin a 8-20
Could of had a 1-3 but the streets were hot and days were sunny
Some niggas stayin runnin for the love of money
Went up to Antarc, slick mix sergeant country
[Steele]
A god a scribe from the god foundation
Same thing nuthin changed, he's maintainin
Just takin everyday, he stay inside and stride
Build a whip, a tard, a nepher, trying to stay alive
Tell the god Ja Rule, I'm comin to see him in the fu'
Next V.I., soon as I finish takin care of B.I.
I see why that nigga Kay be ready to flip
But let him know Rhino's home, fuckin wit the clique, shit
Imagine if Blueman was there, oh my god
I know that's somethin for the ward and the fair
Oh yeah, if you bump into my nigga Rubble
Tell him me and his brother Sigh got the bundle when he come thru
[more scratched up samples of "Trife Life, and talking]
[Tek]
Told ya moms, tell me stop shittin on me, take the block with my phone
Don't forget about a dog when he away from home
You know I'm trying to blow, but I can still spread love
'cause he been down for too long, and I ain't seen him in the hood
Plus I always say I'll visit, switch at the last minute
He respect and overstand that I'm takin care of business
But still ain't all, he needs to accept these calls
The one you pass on your way, be the same one you fall
And that's a fact that's been proven till this day it don't pay
To go against the grain and betray family
Plus I just seen Shack he said you change, actin funny
But he don't even wet it, 'cause he still gettin money
Son, I be straight, fuckin wit the day from when ya bitch show
Niggas be frontin, but I be reppin bad bro
You know the inside coincide with the out
When I come out, that's half the things we talk about
[Steele]
To all my people lock down, comin back 2 life
We workin hard to bring you home, so we can do this right
I know it's rough in the day, even rougher at night
Hold ya crown, 'cause we ready, and we down to fight

Cot damn, it's a new day
Cot damn, but the nigga wanted money
Hoo, hoo, hoo, oh, cot damn
They just can't understand or fathom my demeanor
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two, Clipse they say, malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh
Well that makes me an actor, 'cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes? Live my life, but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same
Naw bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight, rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home wit the chrome
Or that play wit' the yay, movin' 12 for a zone, I'm gone
Cot damn, it's a new day
Cot damn, but the nigga wanted money
Cot damn, when that white hits the pan
And comes back hard, I can account for every gram
And the streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, gorilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla, I'm the torch that carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow, push the O's
Six lay close, hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My hearts on a sleevea
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told, they breakin' my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies
We pop, pop, drop you homey
Cot damn, it's a new day
Cot damn, but the nigga wanted money
They call me 'Pusha' for one reason
'Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to the money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharin' my wealth, dog
I know about my life, I been around the world thrice times
I mean what I say, from that Panama sun, the French chanzalize
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
The sell base is now, somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music
(Are you a pusha?)
Damn right, I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner
Cot damn, it's a new day
Cot damn, but the nigga wanted money
I been if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs for my cabbage
Do you not know the most affective way of gettin' money
Pull yo gun, rapid
Leave and watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord Heavens, why must I be so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walkin' around wit two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire? Me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fightin' crime, go ahead and tell the police
'Cause every move you make, I'ma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga on every breath you take
Not to be broke, 'cause Coldchain fate witness
Natural spittin' from me, [Incomprehensible], field to the limit
Head to the menace, loud niggas talking gibberish
Ground beef, I deliver it, you cock the mineral [Incomprehensible], for certain
Live in the livin' room, searchin' to hurtin' you
Cot damn, it's a new day
Cot damn, but the nigga wanted money
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Cot damn

you might catch a nigga in back of the club
wit a big ol' stack of them dubs
i'm ackin a thug
i'm gold grinnin and flashin my slugs
i got all of the dice at the bar orderin twice
but every drink is hot (why?)
'cause i'm wearin all of the ice
Im a balla for life, so lets take a ballas advice
Stop balla blockin before i put them thangs all in ya life
Nigga im larger than life, im snatchin all of ya hype
Im also snatchin ya money when im callin tha dice.
Loose every dime u got if u aint bargainin right
Hoes is callin me nice, they niggas is callin me shiest
U could call me what ya want, but jus dont call her ya wife,
'cause your wife wouldnt be askin me to call her tonight, ya right
I cant do it girl i only love strilla, but im not a drug deala
im a ghetto gorilla, Im a..acres home 20 inch chrome dub wheela
And lil' mamma wanna high kap, nigga, than forget her
Tha chamillion shove in a, never fall in love wit a
Hoodrat, nigga believe that 'cause im just a thug in a
World full of wanna be's but i gotta stay strapped
Chop, Choppin my own rap, how ya, how ya love that
The ladies know...i play wit more dough than play-dough
when i stay low, and i jus stack my dough up like legos
Hoes be thinkin they Destiny's Child, think im gon pay for
they bills, they say yo, say my name and i say no

All aboard!

[Chorus]
Yo, we came to take shit to the next stage!
And all ya mothafuckas, y'all betta be brave!
'Cause its that new shit
Exclusive! Jungle and Wiz!
Ruthless my nigga, straight out the brig
What's happenin', comrade, you ready for combat
There ain't no turnin' back with guns and cardiacs
I watch my money stack and pop it like that
I broke a nigga back with a baseball bat!
I crack ya fucking skull, you'll need a body bag
Ya family mad and sad, I'll be glad
I'll cause ya laid out, in a bloodbath
Sneak attack with the ski mask and the mac!
See I got no gun range
I got the block man
I test my gun aim on soggy Cornflakes
I got no love it's all pain
Y'all muthafuckas don't want to bang with my gang
And all these bitches over here want to give a nigga brains
Got the stainless talk
Police searchin' the Range
They want to war when I'm doin' my thang
I got ice on, chains and rings and things
If you don't smoke purple, you can't hang
Is you a Braveheart to the graveyard?
Ah, lets get this mothafucking paper
Is you a Braveheart?
To the graveyard!
Ah, lets get this money now, not late
'Cause its the B-Train (the B-Train)
All the whores, all the whores!
The B-Train, the B-Train
Ayo, I don't stop, fuck the cops
Body drops in the hood
Guns shots, pop a lot
Get the cash if you could
I'm in the shade when the coke is cookin'
I got hoes in L-A to down field Brooklyn
Jungles the king of ballas and Queens
I got a little ice on my pinky ring
Money on my mind
The hands on the nine
Understand my nigga, its all about crime
While the blocks full of money and gettas
That know the difference between shootas and hittas
Buyers and sellers
Buyers and tellers
No one guessin', investin' it up with a big weapon
Wait till I catch his lil face, I'ma step in
And all these brave niggaz got you in a daze
No one stoopin' all the bitches gettin' paid
I like that
Ill Will
Bring it back, Q-B to the death
All these otha niggaz is whack
'Cause its the B-Train (the B-Train)
All the whores, all the whores!
The B-Train, the B-Train

(Hook)
Something out this world, nothing like the rest
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress
(Verse)
I'm coming for your neck, hey I ain't indirect
Payin debt, pay respect, now I'm comin to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you need to come correct
This the type of music, make it fuckin flex
Start the gangsta movie, throwin up the set
All the pretty bitches feelin on they breasts
And the government cutting all the checks, everybody stressed
(Hook)
Something out this world, nothing like the rest
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress
(Verse)
If knowledge is power
And power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer
I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment
Inspire us responsibly
But they'd rather drop it like it's hot
That wobbly-wobbly
If you ever thought of robbin me my mom with m probably
I believe it's highway robbery, the fuck out the driver seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprivin your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You false just like the prophecy
That's part of the policy
Obviously just bring technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete
The power of the god in me, no tellin what I'ma be
(Hook)
Something out this world, nothing like the rest
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress
(Bridge)
Never ever, never ever, never do it
Just never knew
Just be as a kid
Never ever, never do it, never me
(Hook)
Something out this world, nothing like the rest
Born to play the game, fuckin with the best
It's a kid with a grown man rep to protect
So I'm still waitin for some hoe layin left in distress

Yo, mic check
Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
Alright, turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Curt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauren Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list
You want to get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin' "I suck"
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud "All of y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm Sorry
I'm bored out of my gord
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'um I was Mike D,"they was like, "Gee, I don't know he might be."
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'till I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Get on your mark, get ready set go bitches
Then we go and add a little propane to it
Then we send another whole flame through it
Clear everything in my path, before I split you in half
You wack nigga, better get you a staff
The freak bitches try to hit me with math
Brushing off wack niggas while them same bitches giving me ass, yo
Now let me give you more hot shit, just for the record
And make bitches want to get ass-naked, c'mon
Party 'til you want to lash out
Better yet, y'all niggas party 'til you motherfucking pass out!
[Chorus]
C'mon! Throw yo' hands up high y'all
Light yo' L, get high y'all
Shit you can't deny y'all
Don't lie y'all, don't try y'all
All my niggas inside y'all
C'mon, let's start that shit y'all
C'mon, and you know we won't quit
Then bang niggas with hit after hit y'all, c'mon
In the meantime nigga just pass me the Henny, c'mon
Little Cris' and a bottle of the Remi
Write a bit and still sorting it out
Flipmode up in this motherfucker nigga, whatchu talkin about?
Hold up - a lot of people ain't compatible nigga
They be buggin on how a nigga spend capital nigga
Ain't it funny how nature work?
Hot shit'll make 'em bounce 'til she really want to make it hurt, c'mon
[Chorus: x2]

I ain't got shit to live for anyway
Yes you do
I see these niggas are hell bent on me fuckers
You got a lot to live for
Shit fuck all that
I'm fam you live for me then
Fuck that shit
Bloodshed Bloodshed Bloodshed
Yo yo I'm ready to stick the gun to my head and bust a clip
I want to world to see the blood that drip puss to drip
Crash the car crush the whip
There was one time I love the six fuck this shit
Trust a chick never that
It's always fuck a bitch then fucked up bitch
Girl ran a circus on me Wringling Brothers tip
Fuck like a neck fuck I expect
I could get weight I'll take half of his cake
Run I would debate father had the nerve to tell me I'm a mistake
I said dad I told my daughter that I can relate
And the beef up the hill is real gettin live
Still sittin by still gettin high
Now I don't hold my tongue I was wrong enough to tell her
That I can stop doin drugs long enough to sell em
Approclamation what detoxication
(Ay yo Cam's in the house) A three rock occasion
Whoa I'm so high you're so high
What the fuck these motherfuckers put in my lye
Make a million dollars yo I could if I tried
Why the fuck I got to pay him him and him
Yo fuck around I'm a spray him him and him
Bet it fucked up when your girl lay him him and him
Look man that's why I'm a give it up the Benz truck driv it up
Every weekend did it up and tell why live for what
[Chorus]
What do I have to live for?
What do I have to live for?
What do I have to live for?
What do I have to live for?
Yo yo I was wishin for knowledge but then have to wishin for college
So that mission obolished straight street life power
Politics and policy makin give a fuck how he's debatin
Give me this give me that give me your hat give me your gat
Give me your shit give me your bricks give me your kicks
Matter fact you're pussy give me your bitch
Cam is clappin oh man can't go shit with Samuel Jackson
It's a time to kill what do I do my girl pregnant
Rent is due the phone is off the heat is off
No the heat is on nigga the street is on I'm about to beat upon
A nigga til they deceased or gone at least I'm gone
What do it matter they just realte the business
Girl fucked my man like Jada from Menace
But I play to the finish got blazed and oblimished
Least I wasn't caged in a clinic and now you age in a minute
But you know the sharks diplomat ho we know the art
Come through leave your shit wet like Noah's Ark
We ordered the pie you sort of a lie
You ain't 7:30 nigga you about a quarter to five
Lights on the line whites goin blind tell me man God what type of a sign
Take a nitrogen nine man that's why I'm a give it up
Wrists stay glidded up every weekend did it up tell me why live for what

Yo its three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, hero, not no small feat
It's all heat in this day and age,
I rage your grave,
Anything it takes to save the day
Nueromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic
Use my rappin so you all could see the hazards
Plus entertainment where many are brainless
We cultivated the lost art of study and I brought a buddy
Automator harder slayer fascinating combinations
Cyber warlords are activating abominations
Arm a nation with hatred we ain't with that
We high-tech archeologists searching for nicknacks
Composing musical [stimpacks?] that impacts the song
Crack the motor what you think you rappin for?
I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders
I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us
Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid
The secrets of the past they horded
Now we just borded on a futuristic spacecraft
No mistakes black its our music we must take back
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Del I'm feeling like a ghost in a shell
I wrote this in jail playing host to a cell
For the pure verbal, they said my sentance was equivalent to murder
Just another hurdle, I bounced through a portal
I knew they had the mindstate of mere mortals
My ears morphed to receptors to catch ya
Every word about gravity control
And the families they hold for handsome ransoms
On the run with a handgun blast bioforms, I am more
Than a planetwide manhunt with cannons
Will make me abandon my foolish plan of uprising
Fuck dying I hijack a mech
Controlling with my magical chance so battle advance
Through centuries a hip hop legacy, megaspeed
Hyperwarp to automator's crib and light the torch
They can't fight the force,
Victory is ours once we strike the source
Enterprising wise men look to the horizon
Thinking more capitalism is the wisdom
And in prison all citizens in power with rhythm
We keep the funk alive by talking with idioms
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Isn't eternal evil concerned with thievery
Medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we ahead of that
Lay it down with soundwaves that pound pavement
Original menstrals my central processing unit
Is in tune with my heart for this art
Not artificial 'cause that makes it hard to miss you
Copy cats finish last in the human race
Staying glued to safes to prude to take a buddah brak
We got [espers] that let us bless with fresh shit
Undetected by yes men questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame
Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos
While I float to neo-tokyo with opio
Or discuss combusitible rust clusters with plus
Evade cyber police in a computer crib confuse the kids
But I can make a kickin rhymes that's sacred
Telepathic mind that takes its greatness from the matrix [esper]
Rhyme professor rushes in ultra pressures with correction measures
Why half the worlds a desert
Canibals eat human brains for dessert
Buried under deap dirt, mobility innert
I insert these codes for the cataclysm
Ever since I had the vision use my magnitism
In this modern metropolis they tries to lock us up
Under preposterous laws that's not for us
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator
Yo it's three thousand thirty,
I want y'all to meet deltron zero, and automator

Throwing dicks to dykes, turning out virgins
So fuck your coupe, it's Scarface and Snoop,
up in Bing-town snatching bitches off the mini six-deuce
And sue that dame, with "True that" game
Get her ass naked, and black-n-blue that thing
The news that came was the Made Men wattn't
But the paper was the influence and that's what done it
You cuff these hoes, we muff these hoes
You and Captain Save Ya Baby Mother, fuck these hoes

(Verse 1)
I'm half Malcolm
Half Kennedy
Friend
Half enemy
Band
Half symphony
Dope
Put simply
Half coke
Half Earth
Half baking soda
Half a block
Half a key
Half the whole boulder
Half slave
Half king
Cuz split half with a queen
She fuck around an split the scene
With half of your cream
And half of your dreams
Don't believe half the shit you see this lifetime
And don't halfway believe
Half the shit you hear half the time
I keep an eye open
You halfway sleep
I don't spit raps at you
I halfway preach
To you shallow motherfuckas
Stay halfway deep
Motherfucker
The Lord is my Shepard
As I awaken the sheep
Shallow niggaz can't follow
'Cuz I'm way too deep
Everybody "keeping it real"
But grinning from cheek to cheek
If you was really real
It'll probably make you halfway weep
(Hook)
Is this cup half-full or half-empty?
Is this clip half-full or half-empty?
Is this road half-full or half-empty?
Is your soul half-full or half-empty?
(Verse 2)
A kid dies
We halfway say shit
An innocent man is put to death
You halfway think he did it
...And what good is innocence
When the world thinks you're guilty?
As about good as life
'Cuz the word wants to kill me
I know you niggaz feel me
I know you niggaz see it
How they wanna see me dead, broke,
And defeated
In no particular order
As long as I'm slaughtered
They say I break too many rules
And cross to many borders
My death
I often thought of
When I go
How will I be thought of?
Live long enough to die the villain
Or die the martyr
Will they remember me
A coward or a Sparta?
I could die today
But you could die tomorrow
People are scared to die
But life is full of horror
Still it's worth living
Like there's no tomorrow
Try to minimize all the jealousy and envy
Cause you could have a million bucks
And STILL be half-empty
(Hook)

[Repeat: x2]
Wanna ride tonight, Wanna ride tonight
Wanna freak tonight, Wanna freak tonight
The time is cool
What ya gonna do
The bachelor,
Is calling you, yeah
The mood is right
With the fireside
And the song you like
With your favorite wine
Baby just relax let the atmosphere take over you
Keep it in your mind that I'm here to do what you want me to do
Ain't no need to rush cause the both of us could go all night
Girl let go and I'll, do you
[Chorus: x2]
All nite, and All day
I wanna love you, in every way
Tonight, I wanna play

Doing all I can and all you like just to let you know
I got what you need so if you wanna get
freaky you should be with me girl
Baby I'll take care of you, I'll do it nice & slow I can
Feel the heat
When our bodies said I wanna make love tonight
Baby I just wanna do you right
Tell me can we take a ride tonight
Top down with the sounds pumped loud, bodies rollin' round
As we noth go downtown
That's what I like, and it feels so right
Baby open wide, and take it all night
[Chorus]
I'll treat you right, I'll treat you right if you come to me oh come to me
I'll do you right And all I know is that I gotta have you
[Chorus]

Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, New York City b****
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, f***in' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't s*** changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pa** it like a relay"
YMCMB you n****s more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm f***in' with her, I don't really need her
Ahhh, That's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these b****es wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Real n**** wassap
Now she want a photo Ya
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto n**** YOLO
We 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, n**** we don't really play
Every day, every day, f*** what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real n**** wassup?
One, time f*** one time
I'm calling n****s out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her p**** so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this b****
Wish a n**** would like a tree in this b****
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that b****
That's my MO add a B to that s***
I'm f***ed up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
N**** money talks and Mr Ed! Ya
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't s*** sweet n****s on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God Becky look at her butt
Tunechi
Now she want a photo Ya
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto n**** YOLO
We 'bout it every day, every day, every day

Every day, every day, f*** what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real n**** wassup?
Wassap, wassap

Ah yeah
It's real
Gonna put it down
All these little crime thangs
Homeless the world is crazy boy
It's like this
It's the way it is
Heavy out there, it's heavy
Was I really such a bad child that I deserved to get hit with boards
And whooped with extension cords?
Did you forget that I was your creation
And all I wanted from you all was love hope and motivation?
Son, you're disrespectful and you're talking back, get out my face
Kicked me out the house and wouldn't even let me plead my case
Now, I'm homeless and I'm freezing like the morgue
The only thing keeping me alive is the Lord
Needless to say it's times like this I'd rather be locked up then
Drinkin' water out my hands and eatin' out of garbage cans
Can I come back home, huh could I?
Son, you're on your own, why should I?
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?
Huh, three years from now, I think I'm gon be straight
I put my name on the list for section 8
Tried out for the army but I was flat footed
Didn't do no harm to me, 'cuz I was used to it
If I apply for some work, let's make a bet
I'll get the nine 'cuz I don't know about the Internet
What do you think we need to do to change about this nation?
Need to provide more jobs and better education
Nuclear weapons, puh, should be stopping crimes
Already got enough to blow the world up a thousand times
The birds and the bees, deadly disease
Teenage pregnancies, STDs
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?
A wait, a wait a minute, I hear sirens
Oh, that's the couple down the street
Domestic violence either them or the little girl in 306
She's always telling everyone that she gon slice her wrists
I guess that's the way it is in the life of sin
Where you'll prolly end up dead, or in the pen
But my family ain't no better than the next
My auntie Brenda turned her own sister in for writing bad checks
And save folks try to hit you where it hurts
Knowin' they the biggest hypocrites in the church
We need to give our minds a bath and do some scrubbin'
Stop the hate and start the lovin'
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?
Learn, learn, learn, learn

Make 'em soak, change, girl lookherre you better get your mind right
(cause...)

It all seemed so idiotic all the accusations of unpatriotic
The fall we'll always remember, capitulating silence
Election November before the winter
Of the long hot summer
Somewhere in the desert
We raised the oil pressure
And waited for the weather
To get much better
For the new wind to blow in the storm
We tried to remember the history in the region
The French foreign legion, Imperialism,
Peter O'Toole and hate the Ayatollah
Were all we learned in school
Not that we gave Hussein five billion
Not of our new bed partner the Syrian
And of course no mention of the Palestine situation
It was amazing how they steamrolled
They said eighty percent approval
But there was no one that I knew polled
No one had a reason for being in the Gulf
We waited for congress to speak up illegal build up
But no one would wake up
Our representatives were Milli Vanilli's
For corporate Dallas Cowboy Beverly Hillbillies
With perfect timing
The politicians rhyming their sentiments
So nicely oil gold and sand
My sediments precisely
We regretfully support the lunacy
I'm afraid there is no time for more scrutiny
National unity preserve our community
Teflon © election opportunities
Were in profundant abundance
On January second the Bush administration
Announced a recession had stricken
The Nation the highest quarterly
Earnings in ten years were posted
By Chevron
Meanwhile a budget was placed in our hands
As the deadline in the sand came to an end
So much for the peace dividend
One billion a day is what we spent
And our grandchildren will pay for it 'til the end
When schools are unfunded
And kids don't get their diplomas
They get used for gun boat diplomacy
Disproportionately
Black or brown we see
Bullet catchers for the slave master
Then the conservatives called up reservists
To active service left families nervous
But more importantly broke nine hundred a month
But the check came late, army red tape you see,
This golden opportunity
We watched the tube and read the newspaper
The propaganda of the gas masked raper
Was the proper slander to whip up the hatred
The stage was lit and the lights were all faded
The pilots in night vision goggles Kuwaited and
Generals masturbated
'til the fifteenth two days later they invaded
Not a single t.v. station expressed dissension or
Hardly made mention to the censorship of information
From our kinder and gentler nation
Blinder and mentaler retardation
Disorientation
The pilots said their bombs lit Baghdad
Like a Christmas tree
It was the Christian thing to do you see
They didn't mention any casualties
No distinction between the real
And the proxy
Only football analogies
We saw the bomb hole
We watched the Super Bowl
We saw the scud missile
We watched Bud © commercials
We saw the yellow ribbons
Saw pilots in prison
We never saw films of the dead at eleven
Angela Davis addressed the spectators
And shouting above a rumbling generator said
If they insist on bringing us down
Then let's shut the whole country down
Marching through the downtown
A hundred thousand became participants
And we heard the drums of millions off in the distance
Rushing through the cities
Some of them did things that weren't so pretty
Most were there for primal scream therapy
News men concentrated
On the negative liked the jingoists more
Peaceful protesters ended up
On the cutting room floor
Nintendo © casualties of the ratings war
More bombs dropped than in World War II
On in both Asian invasions, new world order persuasion,
Business as usual
For our nation
Could you imagine a hundred fifty thousand dead,
The city of Stockton
Coffins locked in when we clocked in...not to mention
Civilians
The loss of life on both sides
Pushed the limits of resilience
The scent of blood in our nostrils
Fuel of the fossil land of apostle
The blackness that covered the sky was not the only thing
That brought a tear to the eye or
The taste of anger to the tongues
Of those too young to remember Vietnam
Is heroin better in a veteran's mind
Than the memory of the dying laying in a line
Is it the smell or the shadows heaving and weeping
That keeps the soldier from sleeping
As he sings the orphan's lullaby
When the soldiers put down their bayonets
The strings are chained to the marionettes
Emir of Kuwait gets back in his jet
We replace the dead with new cadets
Will we hate those who did the shelling
Or will we hate those who weren't willing to do the killing
When the leaders of the bald eagles come home to roost
Will we sing a song of praise and indebtedness
For our deliverance from evil
Or will we sing a song of sadness
For the dreaded debt this mess delivered us PEOPLE.

My motto is "live by the bottle"
So why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol i think, but what do I know?
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I prob'ly could
I don't polly
Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West Coast, the home of the bodybag
The shotty, the mag
Los Angeles, where the party at?
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black
Rated starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fuckin' started that
Everyday with this game I'm gettin' smarter at
Sky's the limit so everytime I get on a track
*Eminem Intro*
It's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook
*Eminem*
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
then so be it
cause nowadays these kids, jeez
don't give a shit bout lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
long as they can go to the club and get blitz
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the DJ's playing them hits
oh this my jam, this my shit
we dont know a word to a verse,
all we know is the chorus
cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
is it the beat, is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
and how do we adapt and get TRL votes
when 13 year olds control the remote
and Ashley's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables
*Emine- Chrous*
Shorty I love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be cause shorty
you love me
and I love you too
and I promise I'll be true to you

"Yo whassup??!"
One two
Rap music what does it mean
What is everybody in this industry for
What is everybody buying rap for
Why do people get involved in rap music
Rap music number one is the voice of black people number one
Number two it's the last voice of black people
Black people have created every music you hear out here in the streets today
Every single music, rock and roll down
Therefore; in a situation that has, all African music in it
All African music, uh, exploiting itself of it, or coming out of it
All African influence in all it's music
And you have what is called American Music Awards
You have what is called theft
And what I would like to bring out today is rap music as,
A revolutionary tool in changing the structure of racist America

Clearer days, crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard, if you need
Me I'll be ah in Las Vegas
In las vegas (x5)
Let's take a trip today
A little getaway
So I can get away
From all the drama
So I get in the plane
So I can get some space
Clear out my mental haze
And clean my karma
So feelin really great
Flew to this little place
So I could stimulate
A happy aura
So I exit my base
This is a little taste
Of when I went to Vegas
Back in the summer
Clearer days, crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard, if you need
Me I'll be ah in Las Vegas
In Las Vegas (x5)
So I get off the plane
Smilin like 'what today?'
Right now a brother may
Take off his slippers
That was the purpose, hey
Just to relax and maybe
Put some words on paper
But then the picture
Got cloudy with temptation
From all the gamble tables
To the pretty ladies
To all the bars for
Like every 20 feet
Now see that's plenty drinks
With all this Hennessey
Man I'm a goner
Clearer days, crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard, if you need
Me I'll be ah in Las Vegas
In Las Vegas (x4)
So im corrupted now
My wallet was in doubt
But now there's fuzz and powder
Inside the content
My liver's puffin out
My credit's runnin out
Ill go for one more round
Cuz maybe ill hit
The lucky number slot
Won back what I have lost
I gotta taste ya now
Im goin nonstop
Now that my credits out
Although my head is poundin
Just then I jetted out
Up To the pawnshop
Sold everything I had
To a Korean lad
And in the back he had
A fly masseuse place
With ladies lookin bad
One of them took me back
The ending that I had
Was happy
oops wasted
Everything again
So now my trip must end
These vices suck you in
I didn't come for
All this so I escaped
This is a little taste
Of when I went to Vegas
Back in the summer

We so motherfuckin' ill
We so motherfuckin' ill
Ill, motherfucker, ill

Illin' out from LA, I be illin' out all the way
Got an email from my K-Town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
I've got OG cannabis, girl, one puff will put you in your grave
Got three pills and four jimmy hats 'cause we don't Kid n Play
Hop out, yo, guess who's gettin' drunk?
No motherfuckers can out drink us
If you're tipping that heat, don't get drowned
So cold, polar bears on my nuts
Y'all know just who we be
I hold it down for the East
'Cause I keeps it pimpin', Peter Griffin
Yellow tinted on zebras
Dripping on your couches
Dripping on your couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with orange, mane, we on that Tropicana
I'm dripping on your couches from the Hills to public housing
If you're feelin' ill, then damn, you ill
Be the illest on the thousand
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here

We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so motherfuckin' ill
Nice chain, what a nice night
My ice bright, I play the wall like a night light
Tangerine, tambourine from the West Wing
The best thing about my room, Versace bed springs
I'm in the building, more gold than Rumpelstiltskin
Aw shit, look who it is, the white Russell Simmons
Jody Highroller, Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some codeine fluid
Dripping on your couches
Dripping on your couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with orange, mane, we on that Tropicana
I'm dripping on your couches from the Hills to public housing
If you're feelin' ill, then damn, you ill
Be the illest on the thousand
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here

Ill, motherfucker, ill

I is for the way these bitches love how I bang
And double L is for the way I blow the smoke in your face
We roll on Es and we be easy rollin' that bank
And ST is for the illest shit we rep every day

[Chorus]
The souljahs marching on prepared for war
The souljahs marching on prepared for war
[Layzie Bone]
The cycle continues look what I've been through
Chapter 5 from the Book of Thugs
Nineteen Ninety Nine two thousand
New millennium marching forward
All aboard seek and destroy
Any nigga that throw a decoy
We them niggas you can't avoid
Boy boy don't fuck around and get me paranoid
I'm on a mission impossible, off da rip when he get hostile
If you gots ta know I got lots of dough
So the murder mo ain't no optional
Unstoppable relentless rolling in Benz's
Hear it repeat weeded indeed nigga believe it
Proceed with the lead and completed it's on
Feel my bombs motherfucker, undisputed round for round
Putting it down, town ta town tearing the roof of this mother-fucker
When I'm in your city get wit me fuck wit your nigga
When I'm in Maui hoes around me still come fuck with your niggas
But if you ain't talking about no money
Nigga you really ain't talking no sense
Out of line with out a dime,
Motherfucker you got me ready
It ain't no honor amongst thieves
Won't waste my time smoking weed
With all these petty conversations
So I avoid the player hation
[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
Still, got the gun on Frankie Sosa
Fully automatic four mathematics original souljahs
See nobody can't stop me better watch me back out,
Woke up in the county as soon as I passed out
Bullet passed the pigs mo murder mo money let's mash out
Mo and mo cash for everyone in the room
Every homie know we move you know the scope is on
Come in and snooze who feeling my music true that
Cause if I was in there
I would of been looting like the rest ah y'all knew that (Bone Thug)
Know we knew that in your conscience,
You ain't nothing but a mobster
You can't be budged
God only can judge you (Thug Luv)
Loot all the cops erase the judge
Heading for the fifth dimension mention
Then settle some stuff legal
All I really wanted was a Regal
[Chorus]
[Flesh N Bone]
Now who goin' be the last two soldiers standing
Doing back ta back holding the cannons
Another episode of my bloodish
On hit with ah low blow
Just a thugging ass nigga
That's ready ta get some sense
I sorta like Billy The Kid
Mixed like a leather show no mercy
Filthy gonna kick in explicit some material too deadly
So prepare the description advisory
If you rise get ready fuck with me steady
Everyday all day daily haters wanna come try fade me
Unleash the gauge release bush
Trying ta feel it the wrath of the whirlwind
Swear you'll wake up fast motherfucker
Before the fifth dog holla missile off
And blast you between your eyes serving no homicide
Victim is blown right, all we know she got decapitated
Nigga your body rot in the crypt
We taping it up to the ceiling graded
Time from time and again my niggas had ta warn
All you enemies of mine I'm coming ta storm
My niggas be storming through with army and fatigues
Feel the grief artillery nigga them prophets
To the apostle living a revelation set off the revolution
Nigga the desperado, you niggas can't fuck with the fifth dog killer
Now haters die die die die
[Chorus: Repeats]

Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab sticky right quick
Hey yo stick, stick
Yo slim shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah
Well it wasn't a good (what was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (what?)
Yo, yo I dreamt I was white! (ohhh)
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white?
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me
(can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white I wouldn't of thought o.j. was innocent (he did it)
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (what if he was white?)
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
(what if he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white (sticky what if you were white?)
White, white, white, white, white?
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (umm?) what shade would I be?
Would I be redneck or skinhead, preppy or high class?
You probably live in a trailerpark and be white trash!
In any case that be the ill shit right? (yep)
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the n word without startin a fight (what's up my nigga?)
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit (how you doing?)
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick (nah, it's true!)
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears when ever I heard hip hop (ah)
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
(what if he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (umm?)
What if he was white? (what if you were white?)
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
(what if he was white?)
Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch tennis and golf and bet on hockey games (red wings man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a newport
Id live in long island instead of new york
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
'cause everybody knows white man can't jump (nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
'cause all of the dreads would think I'm a cop
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white? (yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white?
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
(what would you do if you were white?)
What - if - he - was - white?
(what if you were white?)
White, white, white, white, white, white,
(what if you were white!!!!)
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
White, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
Yo, what if I was white? uh

I write my lyrics on parking tickets and summons to the court
I scribbled this on an application for county support
I practice this like a sport
Met Donald Trump and he froze up
Standing on his Bentley yelling, "Pimps down, hoes up"
Some tryin' to front off
Break our ass a clump off
We gon' stop the world and make y'all motherfuckers jump off
This is my resume slash resignation
A ransom note with proposed legislation
A fevered ultimatum you should take it verbatim
'Cause I got two bangin' pieces and you don't wanna date em'
Flyin' kites for my folks at home
Who takin' tokes alone
We payin' rent on shit they ain't even spoused to own
Narratin' through my verse, agitatin' ya to curse
It's a million motherfuckers just waitin' on the first
Anticipatin' on the worst, wanna weightin' up ya purse
Shut the jobby job down at noon and don't disperse!
They wouldn't pay ya ass as far as they can throw you
They think you punkin' but they don't know you
This a turf operata, play with twelve shot berretas
By the Burger King workers who be slappin' on ya lettuce
Wrote that in the back of those apartments
On coupons from agricultural departments
When we put down the X-O, we can let the threats go
And start shit, it's the ghetto manifesto
That's what I'm talking about
Make me scream and shout
East, West, North, and South
Gonna turn this party out
Hey, hey
That's what I'm talking about
Make me scream and shout
East, West, North, and South
Gonna turn this party out
Hey, hey
[Unverified]
Call me bird 'cause of my legs but my ass don't sing
Got a house arrest anklet but it don't bling bling
Got a homie with a cell but that shit don't ring
But at lights out bars clang and souls get stained
Now it's the hustlers soundtrack, where they muscle around blacks
Make ya thoughts heavy, drop a jewel and make the ground crack
Even renowned hackistorians have found that
The people only bound back when they pound back
So I take out a spray can and pace the pavement
Defacin' engravements of a sufferin' nation
The fouls are flagrant and death's the fragrance
I overheard them askin' vagrants for patience
So check the liner notes, I steal my finer quotes
For d-boys tryin' to float them bourgies in designer boats
And party liner jokes and all kinds of folks
Who all kinda broke
But borrowed twenties cause they feel like a minor spoke
The trees we got lifted by made our feet dangle
So when I say burn one, I mean the Star-Spangled
Let's all get high from the income angle
Bump this at the party even if it ain't the single
Here's a slum serenade, on razor blades and grenades
By nannies and maids who be polishin' the suede
You could let the seas blow but let's make the sets grow
Into brigades with the ghetto manifesto
That's what I'm talking about
Make me scream and shout
East, West, North, and South
Gonna turn this party out
Hey, hey
That's what I'm talking about
Make me scream and shout
East, West, North, and South
Gonna turn this party out
Hey, hey

Having my baby
You're having my baby
My baby is having my baby
Only God knows how much I love you
Having my baby
You're having my baby
My baby is having my baby
Only God knows how much I love you
Mothers never mean so much to me
And for you to bring forth a life from me
Would be a honor to me ladie's soul, ooh
If you go away, hey
If you've got to twist and turns, we'll be ok
Let's hold hands together and we'll pray
Having my, yeah, yeah
My baby is having my, my
My baby is having my

Having my, my
My baby is having my, my, my
My baby is having my, my, my, my
Having my, my, my
My baby is having my

Its not me exactly, that touches people
Its what I represent
The possibility that dreams long ago, may still come true
Even if they look lost forever
I had a homie named Tony, 16, 6'2
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time he was in love wit the block
All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slang, and all the funds
He just got a letter of intent from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love'em and they wish he was there
He had it made like special-ed, about to get the bread
But chose to do somethin' dumb instead
Go to war wit the crew on the other side of town
And was mo ready, and Tony got laid down
He ain't even have a chance
Died for the ambulance even got to'em
So many went through'em
I hate ta tell the story but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid
[Chorus: x2]
When you got big dreams,
Don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams,
Keep ya eyes on the prize don't fall to the way side
I know a girl name Gina
That was a hell of a singer
And everybody fell in love wit her when they seen her
Baby girl was on a verge of signing a big deal
18, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga
Do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came picked her up, told her lets ride
That's the same night that he watched her die
They was trying to hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end ta the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wasn't right
Now he gotta deal wit for the rest of his life
And the part I don't like, he ain't even get grazed
But the home girl Gina, is layin' in the grave
[Chorus]
I got a few relatives that give the family drama
Always got they hand out when they see me and my momma
One could of been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen he was cookin' something else
Now his life in the drain
A trifling shame
He all washed up
Wife took everything
No car, no mo, no house
And everywhere he go he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' lookin' up to be like them
Now I''m throwin' up cash, rollin' up in a Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had as a shortie
I'll be damned if I let another man support me
Now, uncle June Buck sit, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
Every time he get his welfare checks,he don't care
If you want to see him got to the crack house, he there
[Chorus]
When you got big dreams [Repeat: x4]
Keep ya eyes on the prize, don't fall tot the way side

Well, I don't know what you came to do
(I don't know what you came to do)
But I came to get this thang crunk for you
(But I came to get this thang crunk for you)
And I don't know who you came to see
(And I don't know who you came to see)
But ain't another muthafucker bad like me
(But ain't another muthafucker bad like me)
Wait a minute
Hey, get up 'cause
I'm a bad muthafucker
I'm a bad muthafucker
I'm a bad muthafucker
I'm a bad muthafucker
You think you bad
You really think you bad
Well, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad
I know I'm bad
Goddammit, you think you bad
You really think you bad
Well, I'm bad, I'm bad
But don't get mad
What can I say that you don't already know
I stay dead fresh all the way to the floor
I ain't never ever been beaten before
You get a bullet hole in your soul fuckin' with Lo
I'm from Southwest whip a Jaguar S 1100
Crucifix on my chest
I could just stand still and shine like glass
I got a mansion sittin' on 10 acres of grass
I cannot stop
I will not quit
And nigga don't like it
Got to deal with it
Don't cross the line, shawty, let me be
I got 100 niggas a kill 'bout me
Yes y'all
Yes, muthafuck the rest
If you lookin' for the shit, Suga Baby the best
You can talk all you want but betta not touch
You can't handle me
Ho, I'm just too much, rock
You think you bad
You really think you bad
Well, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad
I know I'm bad
Goddammit, you think you bad
You really think you bad
Well, I'm bad, I'm bad
But don't get mad
I'm one of a kind
I can read your mind
Give soul to a stick
And sight to the blind
I can make the sun shine in the pouring rain
I can even make the dead breath life again
I can walk on water
Take off and fly
I'm a bad muthafucka
I ain't gone lie
My mother is nature
This is why
And my father is God
We got a house in the sky
I can touch your heart
I can soothe your soul
I can give your body warmth
In the freezing cold
I can give you joy
When life got you low
I can take away the pain and you'll hurt no more
I can make every dream you got come true
When you believing in me
You believing in you
And one last thing
So you don't forget
You got to be bad as hell to do that shit
Rock
You think you bad
You really think you bad
Well, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad

Clap yo hands in the air like this
Boogie down and stomp, just twist
Don't dare miss a minute of this
This the funk that you can't resist
Wave your hands high in the air
Boogie down like you just don't care
After I'm done you will agree
Even a blind man can see
That I'm a bad muthafucker

[Ghostface Killah]
I had my eyes squinched up tryin' to get through the fog
Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards
Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards
Peace Lord, how your physical?
[Raekwon]
He upstate miserable
Stressed, doin' a thousand sets
But yo check the visuals
I'm at this hotel in Queens
Me and Charene getting' slow necked
That's live, I couldn't finish the bean
Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?
But you know what, Flaco meets Lolita
Flew in, she from Medayeen, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks
Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks
Y'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick
[Ghostface Killah]
Ay yo fuck that, close the gate
[Raekwon]
And lower the shade
Then a shot popped off
[Ghostface Killah]
Hit lil' bro in his fade
And then I see him dropped his clippers
[Raekwon]
He dipped with the quickness
It was Lolita black down yo
[Ghostface Killah]
With four other bitches
He had a nasty hammer, fat ass
[Raekwon]
Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was ninety shot
[Ghostface Killah]
She lit up the cameras
So then I bugged out, ran up the steps
[Raekwon]
Yo I got hit in the leg
[Ghostface Killah]
He shot back, hit one bitch in her breast
Under the pinball game aimin'
[Raekwon]
It's foggy and rainin'
[Ghostface Killah]
My jewels is clangin'
[Raekwon]
Yo Tone tuck your chain in
She shootin' like she wanted a payment
Throwin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo it's all entertainment
Where y'all girls at? Where ya'll pussies at?
Thought y'all bang on Gaten Island?
I killed three things on Staten Island
[Guns firing]
Take that!
You fuckin' with me huh?!
That's all you got babyyyyyy?
Hold that! Motherfuckaaaaa!
Yea! You on Staten Island now nigga!
[Ghostface Killah]
Now where the fuck is your brain at now ho?
You fuckin' with me, brains is all over the wall like Velcro
I fuck your pussy while you die slow
Wake up! You cock suckin' ass maricon
That's what you get for killin' Frankie
[Police loudspeaker]
Tony Starks, Tony Starks drop you weapons now
Put your weapons down or we will shoot
Ay yo Rae I got this
I ain't surrenderin', they gon hang me
You know what it do, yo I love you
Say peace to my kids, say peace to my wiz
I ain't goin' to jail
Fuck it's on G, let's get...FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAS!

I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B make 'em clap to this
I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim
Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch with my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Verse 1:
We used to go to school with this girl
she wore the fat truck earings and the diamonds and pearls
angel on the catfish straight "A" scholarship
smart career, had it all, all brains and I'll admit
with the face of a goddess, acting real modest
I mean her body was the hottest
around the way fine she was looking real decent
graduated soon, I aint seen her recent
till one night I rolled out pretty far
she was shaking her ass and getting loud at the bar
90 pounds heavy with the rolls on her belly
and her underarms smelly
what happened to my class queen?
I mean her breath was stinking, foul ho with the afro sheen
speed freak in a g-string dancing
teasing me, plus telling me I'm handsome
looked like she had faild to keep herself up
that's what they told me cause I had swelter
Que Sera Sera was ment to be, its gonna be
Que Sera Sera was ment to be, its gonna be
Verse 2:
We used to run around town in static cane
my crew was automatically down, drinking
hanging with the fellas on the corner
if full pulled up replied your a gonner
pay backs a bitch and you best watch your back
I laughed in his face he was grazed off tracks
he rolled out angry, homie look alert
fuck that we don't need no one hurt
off the trouble nine scents of manic deprescent
crack that adolescent tell one doubt not
I heard her shout bang out, right on the corner
where all my homies hang out
he killed the boy all unexpected
now he thinks his hood should respect him
no one should die cause of me
I scalped your bitch and ruptured her spline
me and my crew know where he stay at
fools been warned so here's your pay back
Que Sera Sera was ment to be, its gonna be
Que Sera Sera was ment to be, its gonna be

[various hardheads and one leader of the crew confront Dres]
[The hardheads]
Yo, what's up? What's up? Yo, That's that kid from Black Sheep
Word G, shit. What's up? What's up man? What's up? Let's do this
[Leader]

One hot summer day back around the way
A new kid moved onto the block and his name was Jay
Jay was cool, he trucked jewels, packed a nine mil
Yeah, and kept his Smitty's on his tool
Anyway Jay portrayed to be like gard
So we took him in, and put him down with the Hit Squad
His house was phat, full court in the back
Jacuzzi in his bedroom, a welcome on the doormat
Plus AZT, full house alarm system
One rottweiler, one pitbull, no one could vic him
Something strange about the crib, I had to think
Why the whole god damn house was dressed in hot pink
Yo Jay, where's your bathroom, bust a move I gotta piss
Three doors on the left homeboy, ya can't miss
My head was busted
Disgusted
I said, "What's goin' on?"
I seen a douche bag, and Safety maxi-pad tampons
Left the bathroom, went back where I was
Tapped Jay on the shoulder and said,
"Eiyyyooo 'cause"
"I thought you lived alone"
"I do"
"Are you certain?
There's bras and leotards, hangin on the curtain
Yo Jay what's your problem, homeboy you look stunned
What are you doin? Put down that knife... where's my gun?"
Shit's thick, I reached for my tool I wasn't strapped
Left the nine in the car, right next to the jim hat
It's my ass, I better think fast real quick
I got a flashback ah from a Bruce Lee flick
Got in my stance

It's assassination day, I stalk
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line
I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter
From the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark
Pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered
My unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible
Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retreat through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare
First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God
His shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra
UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops know
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti
War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback
It's assassination day, I stalk

I'm gonna make sure you never forget me
[Chorus:]
[Akon]
Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same
There's a lot a haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
[Krayzie Bone]
When I'm dead and gone they're gonna remember me as bein one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors when they gain terror inside
I pop in their mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
My lyrics were potent, my fight was venom
I could kill 'em, when I get in them
Niggas never knew what'd hit em
Legends
For what we done did on these streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessin'
We take em and put em on beats
n we give em back no question
Grandaddy of th mid-west
Crazy Jackson
The lyrical serial killer
I fell 'em, the innocent is askin' about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster than half of these niggas rappin'
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin'
No time for second chances
When it all goes down and they put me in my grave
"Fuck em all" across my tombstone and bury me with my game
[Chorus]
[Layzie Bone]
My reputation is solid gold
And my street cred is all polished y'all
Known as th little boss hog in the hood
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar
Niggas in th past try t hold a nigga down
But I put in my work and checked it checked it
Now these niggas respect it
Knowin I'm th wrong one they wanna mess with
From the gutter
With my brothers
Knowin on these ghetto streets they don't love us
Duckin' these undercovers
These muthafuckers doin everythin to try n bust us
But these suckas, know they cant touch us
They envy deep in they hearts
Nigga if they ever try to rush
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart
Niggas go hard, from the start
Nigga this heart is my bodyguard
Fuck with mine and I'll charge
Little crazy-ass nigga at large
Pullin cars, on these lanes
Nigga I never let go of my heat
Stand up man on his feet
Little Lazyie Bone on this beat nigga
[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
What I got to do for you not to forget who bought you with that straight thug spin
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk with that harmony all over it hey!
Bones sing, 'n mixed in with that street talk
'N then the lazy get their creep on
'N he went home, but its all good
He left the right ones an hes still in th hood
Rest in peace, like him when I die I hope they remember me
Thats why I know I gotta reach you with these beats
Its not for nothin remember the thugs for the songs that we sung
N makin it through that struggle, that struggle
It aint easy believe me, we bleedin believe it
Still goin with that hustle, gettin stronger so they remember me
[Chorus x2]

(featuring Jazzy Jeff)
[Biz Markie]
Huh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh
Y'all know, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh
Y'all know, uh, uh uh-huh
Check it out {"C'mon!" - Chuck D}
[Verse One - every last word or syllable is echoed]
Don't go to Getty, go to Exxon
Like "Bonita Applebum," ya gotta put me on
Got good luck like Lucky Charms leprechaun
Can't believe Freaky Tah and Big L is gone
You think I'm a mailman, well my delivery
Ain't no other brother like the B-I with the Z
Emezah-A-Rrrah, say K-I with the E
I got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali
Not number one but here to have fun
Guaranteed to proceed and get the job done
Y'all, know, my competition is none
Funky funky fresh from the day I begun
You rock with me, you're guaranteed to have a ball
Got a big belly, over six feet tall
My favorite team is the Vikings when I watch football
Here's another one to get you off the wall
[Chorus - unknown female while Jeff scratches]
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear tear tear shit up {"C'mon!"}
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear tear tear shit up {"C'mon!"}
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear tear tear shit up {"C'mon!"}
He's Biz Markie, as you can see
He came to tear tear tear shit up, up, up {"C'mon!"}
[Verse Two - with the same echo]
Soon to be elected in the Hall of Fame
I rock the microphone, emceeing's my game
I flip so many styles, my name should be Flipper
On Three's Company, I wish I was Jack Tripper
Back in the days, I used to eat {?}litina{?}
Back in the days, my sister had a Thumbelina
Back in the days, I liked a girl named Angelina
Back in the days, I wanted to get in between her
My jingle bella, always Roc-A-Fella
Even my acapella will be a best seller
She couldn't believe what I had achieved
Funky like ring around the collar, doo doo on the sleeves
Enquiring minds always want to know
How did I get my ill freestyle flow?
I just tell 'em straight up without no B
Ask me no questions yo, here's my ID
[Chorus]
[Verse Three - same echo once again]
I'm not Captain Kirk, or Mr. Spock
When I put the party people in a state of shock
I'm like Mark Twain, or Shakespeare
Cause when I'm on the stage, people throw they hands in the air
Wavin 'em wild, like in a frenzy
Dog in the house like I'm Spuds McKenzie
I'm just doin it, just rockin the house
Sucker MC's is spiders or mouse
Comin off the top of my head
I'm not dumb so don't be misled
When I was young, I never pissed in the bed
Always listened to what my moms and pops said
Love reggae so much, you could call me a dred
Got a big belly so you know I'm well fed
And I'm a lover-lover like my name is Ed
And I'm +2 Awesome+ like K and Teddy Ted
[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 1 - Freeway]

I see myself when I look at you little niggaz (that's right)
I came to school who? School you little niggaz (pay attention)
Pay attention 'cause I'm about to drop some jewels on you niggaz
Only move with niggaz that don't get moved on
Don't get cool with niggaz that get they scheme on
They'll leave you somewhere steamin with all your jewels gone
(You know what I mean)
I made it out but I'm in so I'm promotin the hood
I'm about to break down a few do's and don'ts in the hood
You gotta stack your dough, stay on your toes in the hood
(You know what I mean)
If you motherfuckers tryin stack riches in the hood
You gotta maintain your business, watch the snitches in the hood
If they snitchin wipe the snitches and the witness out the hood (woo!)
(You know what I mean)
Wipe 'em down
Find a innocent chick in the hood, pipe her down
You startin to like her so I think you need to wife her now (that's right)
Put everything in her name 'cause her credit good
Like houses and vehicles, you survivin now
You makin cash and you can pass off weight
But gotta be prepared to blast and be prepared for the hate
'Cause them bitch niggaz'll kill you and then be there for your wake
(You know what I mean)
Bastards, carryin your casket
Gotta keep your friends and keep your relatives straight

This chick slow ride 'em, blow dried 'em, had him right off point
Put him to sleep then she kindly brought the robbery to him (damn!)
(You know what I mean)
Watch your back in the hood, 'cause hate come from all angles
And be weary of niggaz and bitches, they on angles
Make sure you tote your banger, never sell dope to strangers
Be courteous to your neighbors
I am Swayze, later

Handle it, handle it
You know, motherfuckers need to have some weed etiquette
True, true
You see, motherfuckers try to come up and bogard your weed
At the club, and they don't want to share theirs
Can I get a hit of your weed [Repeats]
[B-Real]
You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they want to be up in the party
Laughing and giggling, sipping on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talking about you want to hit, spitting in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinking about these fucking jokers, double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they sucking a dick, fuckers
Flipping it, loving it, smoking it to the head
Giving it to me half way down, "thanks again"
Then when you see 'em later smoking they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, "sorry this is my last"
I shared some with you, "Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you want to buy some"
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothing's worse when someone's asking for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bol
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended
'cause the weed costs money I'm the one who has to spend it
And that's just the way it is man
Y'all motherfuckers need to learn
You just can't come, asking for some shit and not giving none in return
What the fuck is that man? We going into 2000 motherfucker
You need to learn how to smoke some weed with people
Pass it to the left motherfuckers
Can I get a hit of your weed [Repeats]

[SunKiss]
Yeah...no more runnin
Hahah...
Yeah no more America's Most and all that s*** there
Rockin the mic now
Runnin with my n**** Pun Boogie baby
Lot of n****z fronted
Said they gonna put me on, help me and s*** like that there
But you kept it golden with me my n****
That's right, you f***ers
Dead, and still killin s***!
[Chorus: SunKiss + Big Pun]
I'm the wrong one to f*** with
F*** with me and you'll get stuck quick, f*** you suck dick, hah
You ain't got no wins in mi casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I'm the wrong one to f*** with
Drive bys in the truck quick, f*** you suck dick, hah
You ain't got no wins in mi casa
Que te pasa, hah ha..
[SunKiss]
I'm as wicked as Hitler first born
Cause of me, lot of old ladies purse gone
"Kill N****z Softly" but not with her song
Matter of fact I kill em viciously, brutally
Strip them clowns down to nudity
Shove the chrome where they doodoo be
It's a stick up, don't try to get brave
Don't even chance it Duke
I want y'all motherf***ers strippin like you dance for Luke
Don't stop, give it give it - or you gon' get it get it
Get your f***in Yankee fitted splitted when I spit it spit it
y'all faggot rappers funny as Saturday Night Live
Creep through in a white 5 and snipe five
y'all got some trife wives
Show me where y'all re' at, where the ki' at
Sleep eat s*** and pee at, park your 3 at
Spark like Vietnam, tell your mom through the intercom,
"UPS ma'am sign here," send a bomb
Leave that b**** - roasted and toasted like a chestnut
And if I run out of milk, for cereals, I leave her breasts cut
Got this pitbull and I feed him fresh guts - sick em Cujo!
Steal your b**** and dick the culo
Slam yo' a** and I don't know a lick of judo
Fly to P.R. - stick Menudo
Come back, cop a 6 with two-do'
Cop a brick from you know who, Julio Crew
from Washington Heights in jail I had n****z washin my Nike's
Now I'm squashin the mic, extortionist type
Harsh with a knife
I'm flossin yo' ice on some Bronx s*** tonight
[Chorus]
[Big Punisher]
Cannibalism is livin in my metabolism
Givin em spasms and aneurisms at baby baptisms
That's all my thugs thinkin bout, drinkin your blood
Boriquans love flooded rugs bloody and bloated mugs
Leavin the reverand decap' and severn when I'm beheadin
The Armageddeon is lettin demons slip into Heaven
Goin back to spiritual ritual times
What you gon' find - shiftings of Satan in critical bind
Nevermind, I do that often, I've risen often
Bust out my coffin, I'm a livin abortion
Battled the Devil and deaded his demons
Trained other beings to be in his different levels of Hell,
Still screamin
Seein bodies bloody and babies bloated corroded
Know the Chinese exploded
Know they run with Gotti who know it (check it)
I never run I never ran, the fattest motherf***in man
I roll with Cuban makin junk to jams
That's all I'm knowin and I'm never kneed
All on your soul I feed, I'm lettin punk motherf***ers bleed
F***in with me, better hide yo' seed
Better think twice, before you ride on me
Cause I'ma lift your weight,
Then I'm droppin you in the incinerator
Then I'm hittin the hospital and poppin two in the incubator
That's how we do it pana, hardcore, no more goo-goo ga-ga
Oh I'm sorry pa-pa, was you the da-da?
[Chorus 2X]

Here we are, just us
I know you want me from the first time you seen me in the movie
Hanging on the shoulder of a villain
She could flatten a village
You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis
Somehow, you and my man met first
I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse
But you were
Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work
Back then we smoked nickels of dirt
Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert
And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus
Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus
Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib
Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live
Die happy, knowing that my family's straight
I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate
I been a grown man since I had a baby dick
These motherfuckers ain't saying shit
Close my eyes, spray the whip, hit your rib twice
Now your kids gotta deal with this shit cause this is life
Yeah, and I'm fucking here now
It's fucking Body
What the fuck I'm doing?
Whole bunch a shit
I'm out there wilding
Got a fucking fifty year old Puerto Rican with me
He don't even know my name
But he gon' stab suttin' for me
He know what time it is
No watch on the wrist
Fuck outta here man
Smack the shit outta you then slap your son's father
Your own family loves me more than you
Salute me every time
Every time I come to your fucking crib,
It better be a plate wrapped up on the stove motherfucker
'Cause you know I'm coming to eat
Fuck that I don't even want firsts, I want my seconds first
That's right, I eat right out the motherfucking pot
Fuck a spoon man, I been eating hand to hand my whole life
I motivate myself motherfucker
Anytime I need to think about some shit man
I just go back and close my motherfucking eyes man
And go back to the sorrow
Fuck outta here man
My whole life is a fucking discography b
You stupid? Quadruple platinum
Oops, what's that? Another one

Prod by Jahlil Beats
Late night I done ran out of swishas
Shit its only 12: 30, its still kinda early
I pull up to the Texaco before I hop out
I hit the blunt once more and then put it out
Now as I open the door, as I walk in this door
Somebody rushin to the front so the clerk empty the drawer
He put the gun to his face and told him dont move
Im hidin behind a king of Pringles thinkin what Im gon do
Man I might die in this bitch, we just came for some swishas
Im nervous than a motherfucker, man this nigga might kill us
This remind of that motherfuckin scene out of Menace
You know that feeling when youre so nervous you feel like shittin
Then he let off a shot, but dude missed
And Im tryna text the homies like Im stuck in some shit
Why them niggas is fightin? Scrappin over the cash
I saw the blunts by the racks, to grab the pack and hall bags
I went on the block, here come the cops
Tryna see the time but the light dont work on my watch
I made it to the crib and put the key in my house
Yelling to the homies as they sleep on the couch
Im tryna tell em what happened but they say that Im losin it
Told em my nigga came into the store and start shootin shit
These niggas think Im lyin but Im tellin the truth
And if you dont believe me you can turn on the news
The pronounced the clerk dead at 3: 22
Come to find out he surely used to go to my school
He was a nigga named Bryce, I used to fuck with his sister
Crazy motherfucker, always in detention
Now he facing 35 with a public defendant
Man and he aint coming home, its a wrap for that nigga
As we spark up a blunt, who got the light?
Asked er what the fuck we came to do, alright

It's Fifty A-K-A Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it
You said you a gangster but you never pop nuttin'
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine (yeah)
You ain't no kin of mine (nah)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with the nine
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
A a** like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm f***ing with they mind
I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since ninety-four 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who dropping dimes
You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing
You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing
Damn Homie, in high school you was the man, homie
What the f*** happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the chedda
And if you play with my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'm a sweat her, sipping on amaretto
I'm living once than deada, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, stop the bulls***, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same ol' two step
Guerrilla unit cause they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out
You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing
You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing
Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cause I hustle baby, this rap s*** is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
N****s saying they going murd' Fifty, how?
We riding 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about A-Ks and are fifteens?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and F-bangs, huh
You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing
You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

"Thank you very much"
I'm hypnotized by you
I'm hypnotized by you
By you by you by you by you
By you by you

Aow, it hurts
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The D's tryin' to plant a murder on me
In the precinct, they sayin' I done murdered homey
I told my lawyer, I ain't heard of homey
And e'rybody know my niggaz murder fo' me
You see homi' in your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They fin' to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the stickin' when it come to the orgies
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm gettin' sidetracked, back to the story
These cock suckin' police got it in fo' me
They flash the lights, they wan' rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The unit's, the new people who gon' beheaded burns
Huh, we'll find out when niggaz, let off the rounds
And his partner's screamin', officer down
Police get in the way, I'll murder them, I'll murder dem
A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder them
I said I'll murder them, any motherfucker touch me
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
You don't believe me, wait and see, I'll murder them
You see I told you, I'd murder them
They sayin' I'm an accident waitin' to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waitin' to clap it
A pimp told me, I was made for this Mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from sellin' that crack shit
And the third one came from showin' niggaz my mac spit
See, I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggaz crawlin' under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, somethin' gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed but I ain't been snitched on
You snitchin' where I'm from you gon', get your shit blown
South side, I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
'Cause your, baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

[Intro]
I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high, I f*** around and wanna leave the function
The only thing that's on my mind is I'm gon' leave with something
But it's nothing, and we roll one with the 'tussin, and we gon' get
[Hook]
Get get get get, Lit lit lit lit [x4]
[Verse 1]
It's about to go down, drunker than a b****
Afterparty with my n***** slumber party with your b****
Finna hit the lick, 10 56, takin' sips, let the syrup sit
Let it get the mix, everyday we gettin' gettin' lit
That Purrp purp and I get lit, 'methazine, tell 'em sip this
I'm on that Memphis, that 666, trip six s***, b****es
A 50 box of them Swishes, Ghost slabs on them 6's
In the back seat full of b****es, tryna hit licks, we gon' get lit
[Hook]
Get get get get, Lit lit lit lit [x4]
[Interlude: Fat Tony]
Niggas so throwed like we dont know no better
We disobedient, nigga
Mama wanna grab the switch
We like "fuck that, nigga, we out here, mayne"
Coming down, coming live
[Verse 2]
Just light the candle on the nightstand, sitting by the lotion
I got her open, got her floating off this purple potion
Just take a hit, no time to quit because you gotta smoke this
I gotta focus when I pour it cause it's kinda potent
(She like them all gold slugs) No diamonds on it
I chunk the deuce I'm coming down and I be riding spokes and
I be that pretty muthafucka and you got to know this, this
Now we gotta go get, get, now we gotta go get
[Hook]
Get get get get, Lit lit lit lit [x4]
[Interlude: Fat Tony]
Young nigga from the southside of H-Town
Fat Tony up in this bitch
Fuckin' with ASAP Rocky in this bitch
You know how young niggas connect from state to state
Feeling great, nigga
Puttin' it in ya face, nigga

Yeah, like father like son
Got joey crack ridin' with us this time
I smell murder, you know
Birdman, sponsor this one
And I got 'em
Look,
Young desperado straight out the grotto
I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga, but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it?
How the fuck would I know?
Nigga I been gettin' my Cher
Like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets, check my bio
I started high wit' two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts, cashews
But I'm so D-C like fat shoes
I skate away, like later dudes!
Never get caught baby I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog, no Asian food
I wet up the party so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga
[Chorus]
Keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga, keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga, 'Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't'cha forget
I know ya you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that, fall back
Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the blinky splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothin' to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got yo' back, whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like brrat!
Nigga, them mu'fuckas is broke like them levies
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga, how you want it ? coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you runnin' naked like in old school
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider homie
And you can find it on me
That forty cal'll get you shirt picture ironed on it
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas frontin' war but they runnin' from me,
Crack!
[Chorus]
Nigga,
I had 'em as lil' niggas raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' wit' them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceilin' me and my young nigga
Chillin' I'm in the streets hustlin' gettin' money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga got some new tools
Nigga got some mo' jewels we was gettin' money
And ain't nothin' ever changed still doin' the thing
Still gettin' money still spendin' change
We hustlin' from Sunday to Sunday
And we grindin' everyday like the money ain't comin'
Nigga, yeah we ridin' woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thing
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs
Wish I woulda caught 'em I'dda split they fuckin' wig
3rd Ward let me claim my fame
I put it down Uptown I'm a do my thing believe dat
[Chorus]

You'se a baffoon, caught up in your own cocoon
Leave your head rest maroon
Drunk heavy in the side street saloon
Til' I figured it out, to the 3rd degree
I'm the milli in the meter
I'm the gram up in the kilo
I'm the wave up in the ocean
The C up in the coast and
The B up in the Boston
So what you looking for or looking at now
You ain't got what you gotta shake
Caught it on the sidewalk fake
I gets down, further digging down
Hurt for the red dirt at the same time
Hit rewind if your ass didn't hear me clear
Hit rewind if your ass didn't hear me clear
My old hood could use a little rebuilding
A better place for these ghetto children
I ain't gonna let 'em take the O out my JOY
Before you can rebuild, you've got to destroy
And these walls gonna come tumbling down
These walls gonna come tumbling down
Well I remember when, I was slanging nothing but weed
I ain't round here that can't tell you about me
Fortunately I done changed the way I used to be
When so many didn't have an alternative to see
Music saved my life and now I'll never forget it
Thats why I try to glorify God with it
But it still remains, its in my veins
I know that I'ma sin, I just hope he'll forgive me again
Okay, I'm right and wrong in the same day
And it's always gonna be someone who'll see it the same way
And if I react, who was that guy to blame, hey
You fuck with me, I fuck with you thats how the game played
I had a choice to let it go, but if you don't let it go
Then I ain't got no choice no more
Two lives gone to waste, one dead and the other caught a case
With 50 years to face
I'm raising ghosts, I'm rebuilding
My old hood could use a little rebuilding
A better place for these ghetto children
I ain't gonna let 'em take the O out my JOY
Before you can rebuild, you've got to destroy
And these walls gonna come tumbling down
These walls gonna come tumbling down
I'm so tired of my people not knowing what we doing to ourselves
And we blame it on them, but we stuck in the same frame
Trapped inside a mental instrumental bond
Hoping to run, but theres a gun, what could you really do
Everybody new kicking the old shit to the floor
But now its more shit, crooked, shady, talking 'bout the president
He's fucking other ladies, blowing up spots we supposed to hit
And casually they spreading billions to the little children overseas
Niggas moving G's, I'm on my knees praying god please
A nigga just wanna eat and sleep
With my gun in my own little world and raise my little kids
Doing the best I can nigga
Shit, look who talking now
You gots'ta crawl before you walk, Ohh don't follow to close
Where I think you might stop
We all can see that the grass is the same color on the other side of the fence
Give thanks, people thank alarm clocks, wake 'em up
Every morning brother I gotta stay prayed up
Cause the pistol ain't gonna save my life when it's time to go
Its just in case I get a chance to retaliate
I used ain't have nothing positive to say
Doing my little five minutes of fame
Who done forget from which they came
Acknowledge his name, Lord, you've been so good to me
Better than I've been to myself
Keep us in good health
The white mans food makes my stomach upchuck
But I gots'ta be strong, to defeat my enemies
For the kill, MAC's in your side
Judging buildings, they can't be no playgrounds for these childrens
My old hood could use a little rebuilding
A better place for these ghetto children
I ain't gonna let 'em take the O out my JOY
Before you can rebuild, you've got to destroy
And these walls gonna come tumbling down
These walls gonna come tumbling down

I know this group and they're so avantcore
I bought their shit at the mom and pop store
And I give all of their songs the top score
I'll see them play on their small hip-hop tour
They're treated like sex symbols, out the stretch-limos
Autographing breasts with lead pencils
Now everybody thinks that they're the best new group
As if they're a pop band test tube fluke
They bought a home that's the size of a ballpark
You can only cross the property with a golf cart
But they no longer can sell a billion records
Because when they first weren't trying was their last brilliant effort
Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like "I heard you sold this many units" and I say "wish me better luck next year"
There seems to be too much water pressure underneath your genre-mesh blur
And to be honest I never took interest in the modern day Young Black Teenagers
I'd thought they'd gone away replacing what's on gun racks with cheese graters
To use on the spongy mind of the LA rapper swinging from a monkey vine
Style biting used to result in a money fine, but now
Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like I'm edgy and I'm risqu

What dey gives you blood?
Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy?
Thirteen
Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest
Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating "Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke"
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this
I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always
Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again
Heheheh, yeah heheheheh ahaheheheh

[noreaga]
Them niggas really think that it's a game but it's not
Niggas kept frontin', brown got popped
Word on life, word on my click
All a niggas really got in his life is his word and his dick
And I stay true to them like both of them laws
Niggas talk shit my click's not ridin' them dogs
Niggas hate me cause broke and can't floss
Yo I cop coke, cook it up or buy it cooked already
Like a '98 six wild like a chevy
Yo I floss now, look how much my jewels cost now
I'm realizin' that you me so I hate y'all too
So both sides is hate so it's mutual
Beautiful, my guns make it shoot-able
Shoot at you send staff to clap you
Yo my name's nori but only fam calls me 'poppi'
That nigga's homo like the cat who killed versace
Homo thug, yo I shoulda know sooner
My click stay in jail like robert downey jr.
Like outlaw in the beacon, nigga we can
Fuck wit' niggas think they live while y'all weaklings
I'm from iraq, play the cut smoke mad trees
Buy my own business, concentrate on my cheese
Yo the door lock, four knocks and one symbol
I'm like '98 live, you like double dribble
Aye yo, thugged out, no rules, playin' the game
Every man for hisself, just recievin' the pain
It's like you tall, 21, no out, just go hard
Rest in piece I gotta say to yammy and taj
It's like bitches never learn, money to burn
Yo I'm leavin' like me and nate (I'm leavin'!!) let me say this
I used to rock to g-u-e with the ss
Now I'm in the '98 black gs
Golden with kid in my shit, on some full grits headlights
Shit shine from def jam to crown heights
Now my click keep guns, time to fight
Open the flip on the star-tech and check the message
Cock ten sprint phones caught a deal
What, one and the same like thugged out and ill will
It's all real, still from iraq...

OK ease back before I make position to squeeze
The head burner cookin emanate thought and grab my phallus
Please I pump kinetics with unintentional malice
Want to battle one of us is endin up in God's palace
Doubt my shit's Official the Megatron missile
Bio computer virus with flesh eating potential
(I'm convinced) future MC's are sending robots back in time
As we speak to kill my mother before I'm born be warned
You catch a high place cinchin, lucky you just the engine
On a vision quest but my breathe is on
Bad intentions to herd the lyrical peak, at my inventions
CoFlow providing DJ's with turntable weapons
Snatch that, Disco Daddy, father pops grand shh
Eliminate pretense, turn rocks to sand
You're rockin low budget Doctor Who special effects
And that's half-baked, you never get a buck when you act
E-L dash, P is servin, we smash
Be a bootleg, and buildin up a fat nest egg
I say fuck you, it's easy, say it again FUCK YOU
Love love to rock bottom beats for the flicks
To hibernate and syncopate but I'm still in the mix
One of the many young policin breathers knockin out sequence
Life's a L-O-T-T-O, carry a switch for self-defense
Rappers try to front, but when I rhyme, where that beef went?
If I'm just a reflection then I'm takin over mirrors
Woo lock to mack cornum status, maybe that's clearer
See what I'm saying? See what I'm saying?
It's just the chorus, it's just the chorus
It's till infinity, CoFlow shit, and that's it
I rock prisms in different downtowns
Tainted blood donor, bustin melodies around sound
Left-wing extremist, hip-hop militia
Bitches suck the penis competition call me Mister
When I Collude, with Mr. Len it's brainfood, strictly
Never again I let a record label trap me
Try to clap me, with paperwork that leaves me empty
Gas me to diss me, I swear to God you'd have to kill me
Turpentine FDA approved tactics
Styles invade for thin skinned rappers I bust scholastics
Sixteen-oh-four mackie plus
Leave you in the dust, bustin them ?try move for Jus?
Ninety degrees is CoFlow, runnin interference
MC's they bite my shit, but I don't give em sample clearance
Hell, I put my shit out even if I have to sell
Like a bucket of herbs before a pressing, oppressing
But somewhat excessive, sexually suggestive
I can suck a cookie out of pussy, no question
Back off, deadly like cigarettes and black coffee
Long as I got lungs and a knot you can't stop me
It's till infinity
CoFlow shit
KnowhatI'msayin, check it out, check it out
MC's is like livin in breakbeat hell
You try to knock me off the ladder kid the fatter I swell
It don't matter turnin liquid into wine by design
Not sayin I'm Je-sus, the holy buck, with a halo
Just an urbanite riding the train till I hit paydirt
Smoke bones that's in a CoFlow tracks and like max
That's my flavor, experimental behavior ?by scientist?
Got props from Brooklyn Hasidic Jews to Queens Zionists
The Manhattan/New Jersualem type connection
Mork in erection, fiendin out for female affection
My style is one whole piece, your shit is just the Cliff Notes
Eminent plays chronic, MC's pneumonic
You're buggin now fuck that, radio wack reconvene
I sign for my condition, Company Flow vaccine
Indelible MC's, choice top status
Krazy Kings, from juvenile techniques to manhood
I make my own grain and go against it
Pissin on authority, dropped out of school, for seniority
To do this hip-hop shit, but resonate classic
Pops wasn't around so I'm a secondhand bastard
Hypothesis simple, the earth is my pimple
Pocket the extra cash then CoFlow multplying like triplets
It's senseless, leaving rapeprs elderly and defenseless
Going into details is worthless, fuck it
I got your surplus, as long as there'll be peons on the surface
I claim my outpost and boast, cause I deserve to
Swerve to, miss the link, colder than a fetus on a hockey rink
You think not what? Best be he not
For ? and not givin up a little somethin at the weed spot
Bigg Jus what's the verdict on this beat (that shit is mad hot)
Give a whistle if you hear this, can't best me
Try to keep my lyrics short and fat like Joe Pesci
God bless me
Know what I'm saying, till infinity
Still working out the bugs
It's gonna be on though
MC's can't fuck with me, CoFlow shit
Forgot to tell you that
Mr. Len, Bigg Jus, BMS, and then you have me, Elijah
The one and only diamond speechless starving artist
Goin on from nine to five
CoFlow shit, Mr. Len

Step back from the blowback
Plans that were hatched with the strings still attached
See there's always a catch When you're livin' through a blow back
You're wonderin' why you need places to hide
Keep one eye to the sky when you're waiting for the blowback
Sink into the mud watch out for the scud
'cause oil is thicker than blood in the world of blowback
From ally to madman from client to badman
From Gommorah to Sadaam Starring in the blowback
Invisible sins Invisible Kings
The shit we're in gonna drown in the spin
Permanent warfare
Burning up welfare
Add up add up
Their share of the hardware
Rights disposed of
Government gloves off
Flick of the wrist
Summary justice
Feel the kiss of the U.S. fist
Hollywood, Hollywood tinsel this
Fanning the flames of fanatical fervour
One bad turn always deserves another
Covert and subvert and secret operation
Still sufferin the conequence of active inaction
Tunnelling through mountains building networks of caves
$40 billion dollars for 40,000 graves
Collateral damage and friendly fire
Talking the talk of the undercover empire
(live and direct from the undercover empire)
What's the rules of engagement
What's the price of containment
Can we come to an arrangement
Make a buck off the blowback
They don't know about this flow
Watch the pipe line and oil show
It's McWorld and fries to go
Starring in the blowback
One-sided triangle
squarin' the circle
Pentagonal diagonal
Caught out in the Blowback
Is it really all over
Are we living in endtime
Don't we know that there's no time
Step back from the Blowback
Control we now have air superiority
Their only plane was the one we sold them last week
As leaflets, food parcels explode into nails
Bush chokes on a pretzel and Clinton exhales
Sayin' Cool down India cool down Pakistan
Here comes your new billion dollar air squadron
Laying down a pipeline through Kazakstan
This ends this broadcast live from ABSURDISTAN
Live and direct from London, Absurdistan

Could it be you calling me down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me
There's a time and a place for all this
This is not the place for all this
Is there a reason why you're saying all this?
And can we talk about it later?
I've gotta right my wrongs
With you is where I belong
You've been down from the go, recognition is what you want
And it's something that I should know
Something that I should know
All the things that you went through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Tell me how can I right my wrongs
That's something that I should know
All the things that we've been through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Could it be you calling me down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me
I say you don't need nobody else
Feels like you don't got me so you feel like you've been by yourself
I've been feeling kinda down myself
I've been going through it as well
Girl, I guess time will tell
That's the problem, I ain't got any left
There's somethings I can't help
But you would make the time for me
Oh, isn't that something that I should know?
Something that I should know
All the things that you went through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Tell me how can I right my wrongs
That's something that I should know
All the things that we've been through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Could it be you calling me down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me

Hey, listen
I love my job, it makes me feel like, Superman
Can you fly? I can
Wanna see?
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blond
'Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly using
The constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone re building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy ? Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then 'cause
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make, "Slim you're great"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it
But it's inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

I, I, I'm Mikey
I, I, I rock
I, I, I'm Mikey
I, I, I rock
[Verse 1:]
Check it.
Hold the phone like a call on the other line
I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind
So hold on we could roll to the other side
Side of my dome is the zone you could never find
Quick hands? you might need assistance
Try to find where you are inside of my head
Stay in line single file if you can
Then, we can kick it like kickstands and,
You know I peddle to the chainslip
So fly propellers propel us to the angels
Re-pellin the fellas that's jealous of the name
It's Repellin to rappers as soon as I stage hit
So one two one two mike check
I'm out for hot in e.q. my steps
I don't use bad grammar so please excuse this
I'm just tryin' to let niggas know who I is
[Chorus:]
I, I, I'm Mikey
I, I, I rock
I, I, I'm Mikey
I, I, I run
I, I, I rock
I, I, I'm Mikey
I, I, I run
[Verse 2:]
Mission complete for all those who don't know
Sienara to afros and old flows
The concept of rockin' shows is so old
Just keep 'em off the wall like vans logos
Pull it together the spare change and hobos
Cause if you got change in your pocket
Then instantly the dames start flockin'
And if you'll show me to the stage
I rock.
Yea
Yes that song request, all I need is a mic and English
Drop the beat all right I proceed to spit
Me and the beat start fightin' with the snares and kicks
Now it's a riot on the track
Reason why is cause I'm fire and I'm hired to do that
And I'm fire cause I'm liver then the wire that was tired
Bought back from the dead
Let it rest on ya head.
(If you don't know who he is, it's)

[chorus, ice cube]
With tha boom and ping!
Listen to the ill shit that I bring bring!
(repeats 4 times)
[erick sermon]
What's the 411?
Erick sermon, ice cube, and kam are here to get the job done
So back the fuck up! I have an attitude, dude, I'm 'bout ta get rude
I'm buckin' out shots during my interlude
Right about now I'm 'bout ta get corageous like the cat
Got the gat in the corner of my back so get the bozack
The american dream, the people choice pick
I flip more vowels than pat sajak's white bitch
I'm bad ask michael jackson's dad about e-double
The mack fram, the black superman made of steel
The mic I'm holdin' is a samson
E-d the green eyed bandit in raw fashion
I'm lettin' niggaz know my territory
My ground is rugged. I kill a million niggaz so fuck it!
Nick knack paddy whack give a dog a bone
Once again it's on with the brand new song, yeah boy!
[chorus]
[kam]
God damn, not kam!
But I'm afraid so, I lay low like a brick
Quick to make a cameo, so hand me your eardrum 'cause here comes the 411
Little devils don't go to heaven, 187 on a saltine cracker
Smack a, paranoid busta so don't make me have to act a fool
What's up? now you can determine
The west coast niggaz is down with erick sermon on the g tip
We trips hard on the opposition
Three niggaz on a mission so listen to the ill shit
'cause we'll get wrecked!
What you expect! fuck a rain nigga take a chin check!
[chorus]
[ice cube]
Well here I go again, throwin' up the w
Ice cube and I'm down wit' e-double crew
Pullin' up in my homie's black 6-4
Hittin' switches but mine's a convertible
Matched to the west side, still got the 2-2
'cause some niggaz don't believe in a gang truce
Personal shit what is this? ? ? epmd, goin' out of business?
God damnit! can't leave my dog stranded...the green eyed bandit
Picked up kam cause my nigga need a ride. fuck a peace treaty
But still have the 4-5...glock cocked for the clown
Yeah we down pulled up and echoed sound
Don't ya know that we can drop 10 of these, dope tracks
So fuck all our enemies!
[chorus]

[Mr.Cheeks ]
Yo we come through like bulls nigga take two puffs and pass
Nigga watch your back once you talk out your ass
I back up 3 80 and my stash for protection
Family is raged the world is acting crazed
I never thought I'd make it it was hectic when I scrambled
On point like a knife I'm takin' life as a gamble
And living in the rotten apple yo where every core is rotten
All my niggas rest in peace ya see you gone but not forgotten
Now my main wifey, dead as shaded chicks,
Official Lost Boyz since the year of 86
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill em with a passion,
At times I feel like slashing in Jamaican Queens fashion
You think you can fuck around, but kid you're just thinking
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking
Without blinking man, I'll tare your crew like pages
I'll rip you from the backyard of ? ...
[--A+ ]
A plus the lyrically superb one, spittin rhymes
Off the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums
Rotten shit, make the opposite team call a time out,
Knockin niggas three times my size out
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me,
I buckle up to kick rap like a crash dummy
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money
The fact you tryin' to test me kinda bugs me
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryin' to get up
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pillars,
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock
I speak through a mic my voice peak out at a hundred watts
Who want to fight son, I get dumb
Word to my mother the father the holy ghost and Rev Run,
When the Source set it down, I'm inner serviced
To cop the type of verses that average emcees seem to worship
[--Redman ]
My style is milking magnesia, clutch divide speeding bust
The more the merrier, secure the area, my life familiar
Is ultimate superior we don't jack cars
We jack for aircraft carriers
I bounce like trampolines, when I be blowing the feces to pieces
Hymn em like sewing machines and Jesus
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my (?) Camarro
I get punished like pharaoh for splittin'
You're better off singing Christmas carols for Christmas,
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment
The president of chicken head conventions
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin'
I got a headache from the stress, success not wearing a vest
5-11 for being dirty and quarts of 9-30
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police
She tried swallowing a nine piece
Forgot the warrantee on false teeth
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's
Assault and battery like my palms was ever ready
Sharp as machete's
Matter of fact I slap (?) ...
[--Canibus ]
Canibus brings the sickest drama,
Fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through a condom
Playing with the mic is something I won't do
My only concern when I approach you, is to roast you
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you
Defeating, niggas like Segal Steven,
Putting Emcees in, positions to prevent 'em from breathing
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers,
What's the matter with ya'll, I splatter ya'll
Against the mutha fuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
None of ya'll got the balls big enough to battle,
I go On & On like Erika Badu
A hundred times nicer than the best there is
Twice as African as KRS is, who want to test this
Fuck y'all you don't impress me and no one can test me
An Emcee so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me
All that shit you poppin will stop, when I put you in a headlock,
And apply pressure until I crush your mutha fuckin noggin
I grab mics and push niggas to the left
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests
My hypothesis, is that nobody can see this
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress
But if you want to battle, I'm down,
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks
Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick
You need to quit it, if you ain't spitten
More than 50 bars per minute cause you ain't in lyrical fitness
Kickin' boring raps with metaphors that's wack
All of ya'll mutha fuckas need NordicTrack
To get ya weight up, fuckin with Canibus you get ate up
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up
Been rockin longer than niggas twice my age
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin a fade
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin lifted
Stickin dick to Eve before she was Adams mistress
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness
The Canibus is spitten till' he's spitless
50 bars of total sickness, you won't forget this
I'm puttin' every wack Emcee alive on my shit list
Verbally vicious, tele-connectically gifted
Took you a minute, to exhibit that I'm sick wit it
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit
Going once, going twice
Sold to that nigga name Canibus
Me and Mr.Cheeks, A-Plus, and Funk Doctor
Hopping out the Hue helicopter to suey chop ya

You at the crib by yourself, cause your home girl left you hanging. I'm on the way with my bros, can you feel what I'm sayin? I know you just wanted some time alone with me and its ok cause either way, imma give it to ya how you like it babe, but my boy he gotta break.

Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord I understand
You have a right to check out your land 'cause it's your land
My family told me you've been peekin' in windows
Forcing them to be a little scared, keeping curtains closed
I protect my house but on tour
I try to find a home where my people are secure
Your racist views are the views of your own
So please don't let it enter my family zone
Just lettin' you know, I'm not a little old colored boy
That steps off the curb when you walk your walk
So please don't mistake my kindness for blindness
I've known your game since Columbus came
And if I woulda known how your neck was burnin' red
In your complex I wouldn't of been caught dead
So here's my message from me to you
My space is off limits until we move
You understand that
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord I have to question
Do you expect me to chill while you're bumrushin'?
You thought we were the passive kind, well, you're mistakin'
You outta give nuff respect like I'm Jamaican
The point is I feel you endanger my pride
Your racist comments, your racist approach I ain't with
It's bad enough there's kids in there that are strugglin'
Finding themselves with out you bringin' racism
Just to bring peace do I have to get a piece?
And in the break of dawn I guess I'll pray to the east
'Cause I'm not the one to get slapped on the cheek
Without my fist curling up to hit you back in your teeth, yo
Free yourself
Free yourself
Freedom
Is what we want not a fight
Waving confederate flags and gun toting is your type
You ever heard of Ogune, well, soon his spell
Will clear my brain while he clears where I dwell
I call on the natural forces that be
To help to free me, to free me
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Yeah ea yeah ea
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Yeah ea yeah ea
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Yeah ea yeah ea
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Al-ya bolia bol-I ya
Yeah ea yeah ea

"Say what?"
[Sen Dog]
I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavor of the month, bro, ? try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it
[Chorus: x2]
Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You want to party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'cause we take away ya stress and never settle for less
[B-Real]
When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'cause I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!
[Chorus: x2]
"Say what?"
[Sen Dog]
Ain't no-body better, on that you can bet (Cypress!)
want to see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big success
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new Latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin, see my mic smokin'?
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken
[Chorus: x2]

[Intro: Cappadonna]

Vest did it up, chop shop it
Walked out in Babe Ruth, ex-song, hammer-throw heads
Brought by Je-sus with the grey goose
Famous for The Book of Greed, long nose
King Bentley, 9th Prince will decease, made of Ginseng
Seen it? It's real, liver than chase Manhatten
Word on Staten I was clappin with the Captain
My style is gangsta, bulletproof Guess shorts
I'll fuck you up and come through in a horse
We like Shaft outta Africa, graham cracker wild
Beneath this side, four or five gold teeth
On my neck be the Brolic shit, hurricane CREAM
Guerilla shit, flashin the ill data things
Excalate, sure raids, chez with the straps on
John jumper, Eleanor Poker with the Mac
Me and C. Goines, bible material
Words collide, we might pop up in your cereal
Rock you twice, rock your wife
Best known for drives on bikes
Tell your man to stop sendin me kites
We Tigers Woods in the 'hood
The Odd Couple up to no good
Y'all handsome and plus whisper made son
[Chorus 2: Ghostface Killah]

Pop the cork, buttersoft lights, pop guns at the pork
New York, catch you on the elevator
Catch you for your watch and your Alligators
Blast first, funny style niggas, manipulators, FUCK OFF!
It's The Odd Couple, see you in the Range, bullets start the exchange
Supreme Clients, y'all niggas can't see us
Spit track like an 8-ball, ready to brawl
All for one, all for Pillage, run y'all across stage
Come in your state, bust down your gate
Throw spit like a tre'-8, Ghostface
Live on the crack tour with Bigga C-Don
Crack your jaw when it's on
Crack you in the face with a bottle of Dom Perignon
Fuck Antoine, fuck my Bentley homes
My wife start fillin pits with hoes
Front pole, snatch 'phones out your earlobe
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3: Ghostface Killah - to fade, overlapping outro]
It's like that y'all
Niggas'll crack y'all, attack y'all

Y'all mothafuckas know boy

I say you look good then you kiss your teeth
You look me up and down as you flick your weave
Rude girl body like the magazine
Bum looking ripe
Like it dropped from the apple tree
I was told I should never hit a lady
But I've never been a doormat
That's the way mum raised me
Katie, Tracy they knew
They couldn't keep me
So they tried to keep my baby
See them two are crazy
Alesha was feisty
So I found me the best of both worlds, that's a lighty
This mutha excites me
The bitch turned Jet Li when she fights me
My yin and yang wifey
My certified rider, that's why I provide her
She says I only love her properly when I'm inside her
Damn right
I'm a king my sex is on fire
So hush baby girl, be quiet
You're cool
You're nice, you're nice
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching!
Swipe
Ask her, who's shoes would you prefer
Oh boy real life, real talk
Calm down I can hear them Jimmy Choo's when you walk
You're black, you're white, best of both types my yin and yang wife
I'm looking for miss ride or die
I'd have a baby and I'll never leave one by my side
Someone who's loving me for life
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right
So you say your the one
You the one, you the one
But if my life was in danger you steal, would you run
Are you down if you are
We can ride through the avalanche
She blew my mind out this world like an avatar
Look I got an ego bigger than your average man
Why should I make the effort
If she don't understand
Yea I made the cheddar but she wants Parmesan
Talk trash
Cut the crap I ain't a garbage man
Cause anything I say find a way to turn the tables
I ain't saying I'm a sinner or any type of angel
I'm just saying you'll regret it you're ever unfaithful
It's just you and me G so I beg you just be grateful
Cause anywhere I go you know you got an invitation
I wanna see you there at my final destination
And you don't need a job cause I could be your occupation
But you f-ck around I'll sack your ass without a resignation
You're nice, you're nice
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching!
Swipe
Ask her, who's shoes would you prefer
Oh boy real life, real talk
Calm down I can hear them Jimmy Choo's when you walk
You're black, you're white, best of both types my yin and yang wife
I'm looking for miss ride or die
I'd have a baby and I'll never leave one by my side
Someone who's loving me for life
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right
How do I slow this down
When I'm already in so deep
And the position that you're in's just right
Ooh oh oh oh oh
Show me you can practice what you preach
Hurry up back it up back it up and you'll be gone
You're nice, you're nice
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching!
Swipe
Ask her, who's shoes would you prefer
Oh boy real life, real talk
Calm down I can hear them Jimmy Choo's when you walk
You're black, you're white, best of both types my yin and yang wife
I'm looking for miss ride or die
I'd have a baby and I'll never leave one by my side
Someone who's loving me for life
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right

[Eazy-E]
Perched up high on a roof top
like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at it's own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
my mind is still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms are all wet
I put finger on the button and then the sight'll check
I make the kill here's the deal
after the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
so as the shots sing out like a piper
everyones scared of a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
and simply scared the bitch boo
being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
his bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
now the room is red
now there's nothing left but the snitch
here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
one [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
this nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
duck into an alley so they don't recognize my face
the boy had to pay the piper
so they all stay in debt of a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt by myself as I continue my mission
killin' all fools as an addiction
as the E lovin' the game leavin the shame
and in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
because my heart is cold as I was told
and with the AK-47 I stand bold
rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
lovin' the sight as the blood spills
take a photograph, to keep in my hall of thrills I'm stayin' calm
and never hyper as I succeed in my mission
of bein' a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]

Keep yo hands in the air, 'cause we gon' take it there
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care
Uh-huh, uh, what
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me

Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Uh, uh
If I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
If I'm goin' fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'mma play 'til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
'Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats 'cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework, I lay it down for the hoes
Hit 'em off with that dark brown, you know?
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
You fuckin' wit' me, ain't keepin' your health right
'Cause me and my Rolls, we keep it jail tie
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shells live
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin' anything that I'm puttin' my name on
You might take a 'Drag', but you can't flame 'On'
I know y'all niggas don't know me, wit a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know who we are
Niggas spittin' mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin' fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
'Cause dog you don't wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin' niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (C'mon)
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Uh, uh
What you niggas want? 'Cause I got it right here
Y'all niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit, will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On, 'cause he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all takin' over ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no other cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me, c'mon
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me

Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Paranoid, sittin in a deep sweat
Thinkin I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood exites me, shoot you in the head
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fuckin mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I'm wastin
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick

Lookin through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peepin tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinkin rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leavin out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, "If you scream, I'm cuttin"
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin
She begged me not to kill her, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat, and watched her shake till her eyes closed
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit when they're fuckin with a lunatic

[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room starin at candles
Dreamin of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies bein fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's goin for guts
Boys used to die when I'm full fo that fry
I be ebbin when I'm high
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with sucidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo, get a grip
And bitch, come equipped, ain't takin no shit
Cause here comes a lunatic
[ VERSE 4: Scarface ]
My girl's gettin skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standin there, she was screamin out, "Brad!"
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on granny's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says (Freeze, muthafucka!) Bitch, suck my dick
I said, "Die, muthafuckas!" as I blasted
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dyin from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, "Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these muthafuckas comin with me"
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember wakin up, in an asylum
Bein treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No tellin what's bein thought up in the mind of a lunatic

A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I shoulda been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behaviour
Fuck with me, and I'll slay ya
Ass, beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talkin to borden
You'll never find a muthafucka, so save your milk cartons
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushin up daisies
You want to know what makes me click?

Unless your ass want to be made history
I'll blow your muthafuckin house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold of some E&J;
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream
This is fact, not fictional, son of a bitch
I got the mind of a lunatic

Step right up, Hurry, hurry, Hurry
Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls
Children of all ages
Move closer and bear witness to the one who cuts on
Not one, not two, but three turntables
Known throughout the four corners of the world as
The Fastest Man Alive
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Breakdown!
Born in a ghetto, lived in a slum
But he was raised high and mighty to be number one
The park was his stage, cost didn't exist
And everybody was invited to be a witness
Running things on the South Bronx streets
Known for great feats of skill and techniques
He's the priest of the beats, the king of the scratch
And all the rest are just a product of wacks!
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Breakdown!
Pull up your seats, class is in session
The master's gonna teach you all a good lesson
It's an open invitation despite what you've heard
And the first to come will be the first served
Perpetrated a fraud, said that you was the best
You tried to fool the public and lied to the press
You wasn't even all of that way back in the past
When you know you learned all you know from Flash!
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Breakdown!
Cuts are controlled by the swiftness of hand
The Turntables obey his every command
The method he uses, you say could never be bought
And only by the Grandmaster could he ever be taught
Now you gather 'round the stage to watch him perform
Taking notes for the next time you go on
But you can't duplicate it, so don't even try
Because the Grandmaster's hands are quicker than the eye
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Cut it up Flash
He's The Fastest Man Alive
Bus' dis
He wrote the book on the tricks that you've learnt
And the name wasn't given homeboy, was earned
He's the man called Flash, fresh from the beginning
Taking out sucker D.J's for a living
King of Hip Hop, godfather of rock
Cuts are leaving D.J's in a state of shock
You took the name Grandmaster and you made it your own
Well it belongs to Flash and you should leave it alone
Now fate's taking it's toll on the road you stole
And you can't live up to the name you hold
Grandmaster's his name you just can't take
If the people don't give it to you, you're fake
You can't hide the shame, you're every bit a disgrace
And the guilt is written all over your face
There's no doubt about it, not a question to ask
The Fastest Man Alive is Grandmaster Flash

Mastermind with plenty game, shattered with no sinners, man
Camping lyrical out the deal, just waitin' on some money, man
Scriller, check my afterburn, shit, I just had an ooze
Made a quick maneuvre to enchance the dance I'm used to do
Split up all your fuckin' word, cut them from all in your back
Platinum on my stat and trimmin', joanin', diamonds Gangsta Blac
K C D, we're P A D, K C I think it's over with
Three six grinnin', tap it up, an artifact of rockin' shit
Hate this shit, slap this bitch, this the bitch just like it is
'Quipped with gamers, think they doin' favors tryna knock a nig

Down to get off in your shit, bumpin' real hard like dicks
How been it? Can't fuck with me, playa, a capital P
Light that ass man where's the fire? Dangerous with M I C
Technical difficulty, bump me out, nigga, no please
Pass me some of that green weed, I show you how buck I be
I am the bitch made nigga killer
I can't stop till I make scriller nigga, go fuck around, nigga
Cut up sideways deal with my way, nigga, rock the town
Stand my ground, romp around, nigga, get 'em down
Easily we'll agree, motherfuckin' what they said
Bloody red from your head, yeah, I think they're scared
Nigga, you scared 'cause when I blast, your whole team fled
Me, my niggas and glocks gon' leave your body soakin' wet
Kick in the door with the four four
Terrified when I creep from the back hoe
Kickin' down doors, peelin' wood up out the floor
Doin' shows and fuckin' hoes, Taylor Babies and some mo
Father figure for a nigga, daddy had to lay them low
Clearly pushin' information like they hittin' on that joan
Mentally I say disturbed, troubled brain in this man
I ain't out to please, nah, motherfucker in this game
Just a fact and not a act, fuck with claimin', but do you
Do the same chain gang, know my name, through and through?
Mr. Blac on a mission takin' time, droppin' rhyme
Thumpin', bumpin', backroom jumpin', sumthin', sumthin' for your mind
No Versace straight up thug, no Cristal, drink a bub
Like tonight, maybe the mic go hype and place 'em where they war
Dreamin' schemin' life ain't right, every word done miss a beat
Pen and papers once I got them halloweens and trick or treats
Nigga, huh, nigga, what? Give a fuck on T.V.
Gimme one for some terror, motherfucker, he with me

Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse
Shorty I'm pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt
Tell her to bless the girth if she with it
I'm in that kitchen, wrist water whippin'
Sike nigga, I don't do that
Niggas get blue blacked and blown away
Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like orale
Okay, I'm on to something
Momma should've told you it'd be days like this
It's just a tale from the crip
I'm on my séance shit, I'm tryna' make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch
A lot of lotto picks lost in this game called rap
I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm
Ain't nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss
Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you played me for a pawn
Shorty I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen to what the pastor say
It's golf on that bitch, it's golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tall boy, Jehovah ain't call back
And ya'll still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy
Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street
In the different color McGrady's, that first grader was me
Now my fist full of splifs and an old baker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry
I'm taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon
On my momma I been limiting my features
Filling swishers up with reefer
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick
Golf clique deep and we don't hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy k brought the matches
Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag is
Switch to different fucking whip to let them piggies speed passed em
It's the rats, try and get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou, if I'm on a track niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me
50's in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket, he gone pop it when it's danger round
Finger tips to tapers, now, salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now

We're coming to you live from the Scottish Right Temple
Near the intersection of Crenshaw and Wiltshire
Where, as you can see in the background
Military personnel are mobilized and waiting orders
Despite the quiet and the deceptive calm, tension is still
thick in the air after last night's concert and rebellion
The incident was allegedly sparked by police officers trying
To shut down a reportedly peaceful concert by hip hop artists
Dilated People's
We'll keep you updated with any new developments. For Triclops
Media Watch, this is Harry Allen, hip hop activist and media assassin
And now, Proper Propaganda..
[Begin Song]
Watch it. Yes. [Indistinct shout-outs]
Hey yo we handle it, these brothers are fabulous
Dilated showing you what rhyme travel is
Words spitoon from sunlight to moon
Bustin' on stage like gunfight saloons
Click clack, my mic back, you like that?
Journalists? We're journalists too, we could strike back
Hardcore reporters with orders from headquarters
Behind enemy lines, sidestepping the borders
With press passes, we bring it to you as it happens
The streets love my crew for music and rappin
Street commander slash beat expander
Here to fight the slander with the proper propaganda
What's happenin'? You got a question? Then ask it
The news is just a TV show, get past it
And this, from a quiet wartime journalist
Headlines, wake up, refuse and resist
Resist, like this, like this, like
Like thi-thi-thi-thi-thi-thi-thi-this, why'all
[Chorus]
We kick finance action, and scores of sports
Politics, new fashion and war reports
Entertainment, when we come to perform watch
And the illest weatherman in the biz, I'm storm watch
Triclops Media, record, tape and TV, Net radio, CD or DVD
Iriscience (write rhymes on paper time)
This is why Baboo is scratching and keeping time
[Scratching] I make the people listen boogy down and move
Glory, The pen is mighter than the sword
'Cause the pen gives the word sending swords to war
They twisted it when they quoted Mao Tse-tung
They said political power comes from the barrel of a gun
The officer meets his fate, by .44 .38
It was a dirty deed, but that don't mean a dirty case
Witnesses against the state are shushed
Facts overlooked so the judge can throw the book
Perhaps for politicians with something to prove
In the city where they blew the roof off and move
Yo, questions when answered leads to more questions
Why'd it take months to remember a confession?
The principles are the same even without the name
But I still say M-you-M-I-A
I have to fight, it could easily be me
But just being the thinker than speakin it freely
Although I use my brain before using a fist
Don't push it, wake up, refuse and resist
[Scratching]
[Chorus]

Yo, whassup moneygrip, it's the E on the trip
Not to Georgia, but Gladys Knight and the Pips
It's a one way ticket, to the highest plateau
For a smooth rapper, and for those that flow
So blow like the wind my friend and take flight
And "Fly, Like An Eagle" yeah right
You can't rock a party and make hands clapper
Cause you an N.R.er (that means a Non-Rapper)
So give it up sucker duck emcee you're not ready
To flex yet, or better yet rock steady
With the E Double, number one on the planet
Take it for granted, I'm in control like Janet
I'm in command, plus full of fun
But don't play me, cause if you do you gettin done
And that my son comes to one conclusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
Knock knock (aiyyo, who is it?)
The one who storms on rappers just like a snow blizzard
Yes the microphone doctor's back makin housecalls
To crab emcees, who claim to have the balls
To flex with the man, with the rep for snappin necks
I'm not the one son, so don't pose or make threats
The PMD, yeah Paid and Makin Dollars
Stranglin emcees with the microphone cord and make em holler
I'm like, Quick Draw McGraw when I blast past
An emcees ass, then trash crash to smash his ass
And play his ego, while I sip a forty-oh
And count my cashflow, because I'm on the go
And aiyyo I don't joke, and that you can bet
I flex a rhyme on a rapper, play his posse and step
Like I said in "Strictly Biz" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos, no mass confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
No magic tricks, Houdini, or I Dream of Jeannie
Or disappearing acts from here to Tahiti
It's a one two three count, and I'm knockin out
Without a doubt (Why E?) I got clout!
Homeboy you should know, I'm de commando of rap
Carry emcees no trees, across my bare back
I use measures, and yes all are drastic
For me the E Double, cause I'm fantastic
So, I let you know, money I don't play
Step back and you won't get smacked, hear what I say?
Lay low Afro, or take a nightcap
And if you tired (yo, then go take a nap)
Or close your eyes and chank em like a Jap
Then lounge, as I rock across the map
Yo watch me go, flame dust in seconds
Me and PMD and the sound from our records
Check out the beat and the style I'm usin
It's total chaos, no mass confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion
Last rhyme was for E, this one's for the Gipper
Give me room, 'cause I'm about to rip a
Emcee's head off as I release my steam
The method of decapitation, is the guillotine
So check out the tempo, and let your body go
Cause a brother like MD's about to go Rambo
A Microphone Doctor, an emcee physician
An all around scholar, a rapper technician
So put up or shut up, cause MD is like fed up
You, your wack crew, your whole damn set up
Suckers still slippin, you better get a grip and
Change your wack style while the clock still tickin
Cause pursuin and doin a brother, is second nature
Can you feel it E Double? (Yeah, somethin like)
To the Microphone Doctor, all rappers are obsolete
You lack style and composure, plus your rhymes are weak
I gave you all due respect, when I said mic check
You're still slippin Duke, it's time to snap that neck
Like I said in "Strictly Biz" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos, no mass confusion

[Intro:] (Phonte)
I'm gonna need you to sing this one in a minute...
You ready? (yeaaaaaah)

I like the place you take me
A place of love & safety
Your love's all I wanna know
Darling you're such a blessing (such a blessing)

You're the one I've waited for (I've waited for)
[Chorus:] (Phonte)
I want to call you everyday

This must be love (be love...yeah)
Bring you some wings on your lunch break
Like, baby how's your day'?

Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again (One more time, baby I don't think they heard you)
[Chorus Cont...:] (Munsinah)
It's just something inside us
Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again
[Verse Three:] (Phonte) (Rapping)
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh...
So hot you're melting
When you fall down I'll lend a helping
Hand to measure
Cause I'm your pleasure
Principle like Mr. Belding
When the bell rings
We change classes
From welter to heavyweight upgrade passes
Weekends where we resort
To all your favorite resorts
Have a couple drinks go out dancing
On the dance floor, doin' our two step
People they wonder, wanna know who the eff
Is this dude, he
Acts so cooley
I just school these niggas like UNICEF
You can do the rest
I see through your dress
Make a nigga weak in the knees
The birds & bees and the dos & don'ts
Something to behold
I know what you want...I know what you want
[Chorus Cont...:] (Munsinah)
It's just something inside us
Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again

[Bun B:]
Remorse
Vengeance
Lost of a loved one
Relative in commander to the game of life, in which one chose to adapt to as a gangsta
Enter my mind
Fill my heart
My emotional pain
Can you feel it?
Naw
Can you feel it?
If you haven't experienced that nature of life, it's gutta
[Chorus: Cobe]
I got this drama
Don't worry momma
Cause I got the armor
On my back, when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thang
Cock that back
You don't wanna be (gone)
Another goner (gone)
In the game (gone)
Another soldier (gone)
In a grave (gone)
Bendin' corners (gone)
Finna bang (gone)
Another soldier (long gone)
In the grave (grave)
[Bun B:]
We are the mighty middle fingaz
We do not accept hate
Love us or die
[Mddl Fngz:]
Yeah fat-boy slow, but a nigga ain't quick
Ho limped through the door, lay a nigga on his d*ck
Open up the door, nigga standing like "sh*t"
Fifteen full bricks, same price for a hit
Nigga I done done it, it ain't gotta be a lick
And if I'm plexin' with you partner then the choppa goin' piss
Shootin' up ya corner make a sound like "swish"
But I low so gat cause the chopper don't miss.
[Bun B:]
No the chopper goin' hit
Bound to leave ya dome split
Lose ya bodily functions
Have me think you goin' shit
Mddl fngz, strong click
Bun b, the strong spit
Put you six feet under
Why not have a long sit
Long walk, short pier
Mane have a long flip
Got the streets on lock
And got the yola on whip
Tell momma we comin' home so don't trip
[Mddl Fngz:]
If I tee, don't worry bout me
Momma I'm a g
I know how to handle niggas tryin' to come up on me
Tryin' to run up on me
Thinkin' you goin' try me
Shit in a bag
Drinkin' through a iv
So appreciate ya breath
While you got some left
Ya life's a bi*ch
They got permanent pms
And my only fear of death is reincarnation
So it ain't sh*t for me to make you niggas er patients
Another soldier in the grave
[Chorus]
[B.a.n.d.i.t:]
Two nines, four clips
Prayin' that you niggas trip
Lookin' for some trouble
Finna bust you niggas bubble
And I don't give a fuck about your happy meal mug
We can go toe to toe, or trade these slugs
So catch a square nigga
And I won't budge
Don't plea bargain now, nigga save it for the judge
I might have you niggas lookin' like a strawberry fanta
Did so much, done burned myself, retire my bandanna
Southwest got them soldiers
Some movin' doja
Some movin' x
But they mostly movin' yola
With guns in the holster
We never leave the toast'a
Face could wind up on a rest in peace poster
Rest in peace? no suh
Pissin' on ya grave-site
Then get real nigga with it and go fuck ya wife
So think twice
One for you and ya momma life
Band I-t, shoot the soldiers like I shoot the dice
[Bun B:]
For my nigga bad ass bam, I'll open ya head
For young lo, I'll let that forty-four fill ya with lead
For big munsta, I'll pull out the Thompson and straight squeeze it
Behind sean wee I'll cut you off at the knees
For the band I-t, I'll close range ya with the mac
And for k.s.o lot, I'll put the glock to ya back
Middle finger, this ain't a act
This uncut coke
Don't ever play us for a joke
You'll get ya bi*ch-ass smoked
We go for broke
[Chorus]

(intro up to this is the chopped up version of the beginning)
The stars that want me, all i've been chasing
You up and down, just in case you need me
Can't make you choose between your heart and your head
I'll walk you through the parts I understand
Oh, it takes you to another place
Oh, it takes you far away from me
Why do you go and I can't follow
I hate to watch you fall apart
Oh, why must you be this hurt and alone
Oh, you know it breaks my heart
Oh, you know it breaks my heart
Hold on, hold on, don't you leave me alone
Already gone, you slipped inside yourself
I could give up and let your troubles have you
It's hard to love the stranger you've turned into
Oh, it takes you to another place
Oh, it takes you far away from me
Why do you go and I can't follow
I hate to watch you fall apart
Oh, why must you be this hurt and alone
Oh, you know it breaks my heart
Oh, you know it breaks my heart

Tryin? man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin?
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin? yes, I'm strivin?, lies and lies ain't buyin?
How does it go?
Walk to a time when minds was one
Came into creation as itself, mankind was born
Step into the eye of the storm, survive as pawn
Casualties of evil men, slidin? the blinders on
Lies will spawn, hey, are you conscious what side you're on?
Is the total story told or is it they hide you from?
Why are we, on the brink of murderin? more innocent?
Now we slide, we're patriotic and so militant
Get ya ride on, rise on, take a look
They done even takin? righteous laws, rewrote the books
To benefit the prize they got they eyes on
Minds run rampant, to be revealed when the proper time comes
Brain washers
Tryin? man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin?
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin? yes, I'm strivin?, lies and lies ain't buyin?
How does it go?
Brain washers, it?s when you think how they wanna think
Speak, how they wanna speak, livin? in defeat
When you don't wanna question what they teach, as the truth
With no proof, with the fear of burnin? in eternal heat
When your programmed not to be your own man, but a sheep
Bein? heard as they word it, so you think it ain't free
When you sleep in a deep sleep, standin? on your feet
When your beat makin? ends meat, raw, thin and they see
Now your labeled obsolete, workin? for relief [Incomprehensible]
In the heat on bare feet, smile, showin? off your teeth
Good grief, it?s a [Incomprehensible] how they work it
And they jerk it, while they surf, plus the surf keeps
The [Incomprehensible] underneath the brain washers
Tryin? man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin?
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin? yes, I'm strivin?, lies and lies ain't buyin?
How does it go?
Tryin? man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin?
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin? yes, I'm strivin?, lies and lies ain't buyin?
How does it go?
Tryin? man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin?
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin? yes, I'm strivin?, lies and lies ain't buyin?
How does it go?
{You just keep playin', can you bring that level up in my earphones?
And you bring their level up in my chairs, 'cause I'm playin' with sticks
And I'm drownin' 'em out, so if you can give them more of this
Yeah, you can bring that in even more, bring up}
{Yeah, you guys play
Yeah, that's perfect
Sounds of science
Cool-Aid, Chemistry, Arrow}

(Talk)
Good evening
Welcome to channel 187 Murder 1 News
Tonight we focus on the city of Vallejo in the state of California
Where five black men were found dead at the water front
From various gunshot wounds
This brings the homicide rate in the state of California to one of the
highest in the nation
And is now known to you as killa kali
(Verse 1)
The state of California niggas call it killa kali
Murder weapons in the river bodies found in the alleys
Bring the yellow tape
Body bags gettin zipped up
Heads blown off wit they insides ripped up
Mobile phones flipped up
Factors callin shots
Bitch made niggas its some real niggas on the block
Cause every hood got a trigga happy nigga
That don't give a fuck about puttin two in your liver
But how you figure you can do dirt and stay clean
Niggas like that get pronounced dead on the scene
ain't no winnin teams cause everybody taken losses in they hood
Reminiscin on they niggas man I wish I could
Bring back the homies that I lost up in that funk season
Gotta check myself or let that alcohol be the reason
So I just poor a little liquor on the concrete
For my dead homies and the ones who ain't gone see the streets
Locked up with the rest of the locs
But whatever the reason my folks are walkin the yard
Or gettin they guts some
Tryin to make it home but I think they
Safer in that pin cause niggas on gin be lettin them Mack 10's
Bust 32 times
And niggas who ain't in it gettin shot by
Standards on the block
Smokin like bomb
Fools given up they cell
Gettin sideways leaven them t-shirts soakin wet
Retaliation is a must
So now you know them niggas you was funkin wit
Gone be at yo do so
Keep yo hand on yo nina in the valley
Or get dumped in the alley
Fuckin around in killa kali
(Chorus 1)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)
(Chorus 2)
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buddahba
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buck buck
It's killa kali It's killa kali
budduhba
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buck buck
(Verse 2)
The killins on
ain't even safe when you at home
Whatever dirt you do
gone follow you until you gone
So pack ya chrome
And handle your own cause potnas tend to run
Walked in the party 10 deep and only left wit one
Real nigga on your team
But you know how it is
Can't even trust them niggas that you knew since you was kids
It ain't no thang
I let them niggas have it to
Bitch up and I switch up on that ass before I blast you
And fools better watch them hoes in they mix
Seen them chosen and you bid on that set up for a six
foot ditch with your family in front of you
So many niggas slip
That's how they slide a bitch up under you
I wonder whose the next nigga
To catch a bullet for sex nigga
Thought you was cock until they chopped you with them tecs nigga
I think the game is on its last leg
Trigga happy niggas wit no heart
It ain't no used to be
For your life
cause out here they quick to take they own
Snortin that Peruvian
On Hennessey you know they gone
can't tell a nigga shit in the 9-5
All about they scrilla doin niggas in on the side
Bellin through yo hood buckin fools down
Gettin caught slippin with they mutherfuckin pants down
Sleep with one eye open in the valley
cause everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali
(Chorus 1)
(Chorus 2)
(Verse 3)
California niggas be plottin on fools
Jackin mutherfuckers for them daytons
And leave that ol' school
Sittin on with yo face in the dash
two in the back of yo head
Rip yo pockets of then laugh
Then you got them fools on the track pullin out glocks
Pistol whippin niggas till they drop
Reach in they draws and take they rocks
They money
They rings and they chains
Without a skimask on
But can't complain
Its all in the game
Follow one of them ballers to they residence
tyin niggas up
Lookin for them dead presidents
Its for the money
You know the scratch but now we call it scrilla
It turned them kali niggas into straight killas
Set trippin on a daily basis
Vietnam ain't shit on what a nigga in the hood faces
1-8-7 case
Cop into a lesser charge
Three strikes
Hit you with that L
Lock behind bars
Bellin wit a strap
Punks seem like its waitin
To catch a nigga slippin or get killed over conversation
Fuckin wit bitch will get you killed quick
Niggas let they hoes mow down they homies on the real beitch
Fools come to kali thinkin club med
Caught up in the cross fire when them sets bump heads
Keep yo hand on ya nina in the valley
Or everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali
(Chorus 1)

I can see you but you can only feel my touch
And thats if I want you too
Im like a ghost with an attitude
Youd be surprised if you knew what Im able to do
So I suggest all the ones that hate, grow the fuck up
Cause acting like a child is fake
Subliminal is what you are to me just a message in a bottle drifting out to sea
Can you catch up cause Im passing fools,
Anybody fucking killa makes his own damn rules
So dont be jealous homie that your ass is stuck cuz
On this side of the fence you aint man enough bro
In other words keep my name from your mouth
Before the natives come knocking for your ass to come out
Know what I mean cause if you dont you will
Cause Im tired of these fakes trying to be real
Chorus (x2)
Im here
And you cant hide
From the entity
Whatcha, whatcha, whatcha, whatcha, whatcha, going do
Whatcha going to do bitch, whatcha going to do bitch (do something) (x2)
I bet the hairs on your neck always stand up
Every time that you think of me
If its on then its on make a move mofucker
But you best watch where you creep
You should have known shit here dont change
Im always be down for life
Listen though Im give it to you raw
Some of yall need to step aside cuz (move over bitch)
Chorus (x4)
Im leaving all street cats with a bowl of warm milk
Claiming 313 cause you think itll help
If you aint true to your city, you aint true to the game
Just another fence jumper out looking for fame
So now Im here just to clear shit up
If you aint down to pay dues
How you expect to move up
Werent nothing in this life handed to me for free
Hard work is the reason Im the entity
With a bank full of bread because the worlds full of greed
Thats why us Detroit stray dogs be chasing the weak
And bite they ass like a rattlesnake and slither away
And leave em dead for the vulture to come pick at they face
Somebody in the neighborhoods talking shit
Wheres he going to run because there nowhere here to hide (x2)
Chorus (x4)
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living and not be written among the righteous
Chorus (til end)

[E-40]
Don't cha' know...

Mob style, sippin' yac, top of the line rhyme,

Fuckin' em' like that there beats, don't cha' know

Mob style, sippin' yac, top of the line rhyme,
Fuckin' em' like that therapy
Fuckin' em' like that there beats, I'm just a hustler
[Verse 1]
I'm goin' federal, justice ain't no damn miracle
Fuckin' em' up like that, puttin' in work something terrible
So before you mention to step to me
You better get up on my history
I'm known to the world as Mr. F-L-A-M-be	-O-why-A-N-T
Killin' motherfuckers off crucial
Sittin' em' down mutual
Spittin' that ol' playa, gangsta shit
Tryin' to maintain a strong grip
V-Town, California where I was born and raised since
1979 I been a hustler on the go
Pop-pos want to harass
Me and my Keesh I needed cash
Rocks wasn't groovin' at the time
So way we got out money was cuttin' grass
Leader not a follower, became a Hill-Side baller
Put together a group called the see-L-I-see-K
And I was the shot caller, I'm goin' federal
[E-40]
I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler don't cha' know
I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler don't cha' know
[B-Legit]
Why don't cha' get up on this mic
And spit some of that ol' gangsta shit back at em' man, would ya
[Verse 2]
I'm on the last nickels, they only made like four of
Front-row seats at the fights
Takin' long, expensive flights
I love playin' hully-gully
Cause I ain't nothin' nice on them dice
So before you gamble against a hustler, I advise you to think twice
Napoleon, macaroni, we serve hot-bellied pig
96, 6 big screen television I bought for my kid
Livin' kind of comfortable
40 comin through with the real number
From blocks and blocks away you can here the boom, blam, bumble
Full tank of petro, up the metro, I'm like federal
Hoes want to get sexual cause they see me on a pedastal
Nibblin' on my jock, like my big, ol' black tool is edible
Tellin' you man these heifers now days is incredible
Dishin' them one time scouts
Through dark alleys, takin' other routes
Hoppin' over barb-wire fences, ditches, puddles, crickets
Mobbin' and squadin' hoggin' and guardin' bitches, check it out
Takin' and shapin' and makin' a bunch of riches
Yeah man, you can call me federal
[
B-Legit]
Yeah man, these motherfucker be ridin' around here
In these bootsy ass cars and what not man

And they ain't even got they grin on
Ya aughta be like my boy 40, while he Mr. Flamboyant
[Verse 3]
I got boys from my team with the up-most respect for me
For-real lunatics that's willin' to kill for me
Way too much love in my organization, I can't afford to take no loss
MC's be seelin' them wolf tickets, but I be serious as fuck boss
It's all part of the rap game and that's the way it should be goin'
E-40 tellin' em' like it is, shootin' the gift that I be flowin'
Might as well go on and admit it, it's who you know
Not how damn good you are
Everybody and their mama want to rap fast but I'm the superstar
E-40 why don't you slow it up a lil' something and go and speak on it
Man I just be spittin' this shit to keep these suckers timid
Well what about them ones that don't be recognizin' ya game
Must be stuck on something either that or they're lame
Funny style pop or rock, naw that ain't my forte`
I'm sellin' a bunch of units underground without any airplay
Folks be wantin' to hear this type of shit when they roll
Man I'll never sell my soul
Motherfuckers you didn't know, I'm federal
[B-Legit]
Uh, E, you still fuckin' em up like, E
It's been like three years in this motherfucker

Hell yeah, you know a hog like me had to put the peas in the pod
Let these motherfuckers know what's goin' down in the rap game
You know what I'm sayin' (Yeah)
I'm a money-hungry motherfucker, you know what I'm sayin'
All about my scratch, artillery, fire arms and gats and shit
[B-Legit]
You know like that, that's right
But you know it's still some folks out there

(for want of a name the shoe was lost)
(for want of a shoe the horse was lost)
(for want of a horse the rider was lost)
(for want of a rider the battle was lost)
(for want of a battle the kingdom was lost)
(and all for the want of a horse shoe...)
There is a hole in front of the shovel, shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each withered his mule-ish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames
If you would clue the crew into the civil
Just get the food and land like you the man who flew the coop over the pit-bulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nano police
Sat beneath an avalanche and jagged and nautical seas
And I would stop the violence more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
A is gullible he figure all man equal no brainer
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very church-y eighties
Sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of Haties
And he brazen but apparently infernal bound now
For when a man had coughed recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
Observing how the giveth is disproportionate to the taketh away decide to maketh his day
All the stoic odium glowing a coal holster
When he coulda stood easily in the tub juggling toasters
[Chorus]
No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
To treaty to sign
No city to guard
I pick the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now it clawed the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive
Coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
Holmes, the barnicles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into suitor's capital to a beggars hand
Comfortably, sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat
Umm, what? !?
The chinny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma
Along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer
Now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons
All kings hang em for the cliff side drip dry
Will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive
If he live, will he survive the milligrams of middle ground
They pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles
Dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east
Now the wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miled high

[Andre Nickatina]
Sometimes I feel like I'm caught in a verse
Or I'm Bobby Fischer but nobody cared to search
Can't look my mother in the eye no mo'
Can't tell her that the god don't get high no mo'
Its the begining of a train wreck
Hold ya heart cause believe me the camera won't explain it
Or contain it, an angel said "free"
Was I really what you wanted me to be?
You trust the soul of the icey cold
Because they bump you where guns and the drugs is sold
And where the gods said they're born to roll
And they'll think like this until they gray and old
I think back to when I was drug free, care free
But that was long ago kinda like a memory
Do you remember me? Man it was long ago
We used to like each other livin in the Fillmoe
You never said no I never said hoe
But like I said in the begining that was long ago
And from the start yo you knew I wasnt Mozart
Marvin Gaye always said life comes apart
And like a puzzle, some times it gets worse
I'd probably break down if I step into church
[Equipto]
Man
We had dreams of doin things with money
Its funny how situations get ugly
I usta believe when a girl says she love me
But now I take off, don't look back and keep runnin'
A hundred miles an hour I'm hidin my smile
But now I find time just for writin it down..huh
It's kill joy, I'm still your boy
'til then I'ma build and destroy
And fill the void
I keep sinnin in this sensitive world
Though I've never gotten this for a lesson to learn...(never)
Baby keep askin me when I'd return
Not knowin' I'm a playa in every sense of the word..HUH
My momma cry she know I ain't livin right
Can't legiaimize who I am in her mind
Am I blind or just too ignorant?
I'd give my life to feel that innocent
I can't look back
Bags is packed
Sayin "Won't nobody know where I'm at" ..(gone)
Across the map
No contact leave the phone
Rollin stone, and RARELY be at home
I got a plan to get away
Hustlin' a family
We can live for betta days
Or I mean HAPPY
But everything comes with time
ONE HEART
ONE LUV
ONE LIFE
...................its like that

Give it all you got and make sense we are clubbing
Its all a mass of music loving we can dace all night no question
This place so important when the party comes to the roof
Shorty no stop the DJ ..but is .. one roll at loose
But if it gets hot just make a move
.. away dont hesitate cause the girls in the
To the right to the left I make you shake
I like your body body
Make me so naughty naughty
Wanna touch you like Pilates
Hey shorty
Marching to the night
Singing hey yo
Gona leave the day behind
Singing hey yo
Keep on marching on
Help me marching on
Keep on marching on
Help me marching on
Lets get this party up ..
Show you how to grove when the swag turned out
Hit it up with a brand new sound
Bom bom .. for the crowd .. in this town
Help a boy ship this ..its allday
Party .. just inc ase
Get your move on no shoes on
Bases on .. feeling like a rockstar
Playing with a guitar
Marching to the night
Singing hey yo

Singing hey yo
Keep on marching on
Help me marching on
Keep on marching on
Help me marching on

I'm gon drop a bitch, security ain't stopping this
Real niggas get pop-a-liss, right and drop a rhynoserous
See we all about pain you niggas is lame, we ahead of the game
Out of my tool is a train, we searching for change you hating on fame
Now, some of these ugly ass girls in herr
Think they too fly, to say what's up to a nigga
I want you to look at that and hoe and say
Fuck you (fuck you), fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you), fuck you (fuck you)
Now drop that trick, (drop that trick)
Drop that trick, (drop that trick)

[Chorus: x2]
Hold up purple one, let O-Tum invade the cut
And lean on a nigga, like (the drank up in my cup)
Everybody make room, I'm bout to cave his chest in
And make his eyes swell up, to where his edge up begin
Tum a shit starter, Tum always to blame
I ain't never played sports, therefor I don't play games
Better ask these dudes, I will rock a nigga ass
And if your click pop off, I'ma slap they monkey ass
Gangsta-gangstafied, that's how we do it in the Dirty
Hit a weenie nigga, with a combination flury
Left-right-right-left, overhand with a quitter
Make room in this bitch, when DSR enter
Headed straight to the bar, to get about a bub
After that hit VIP, and fire up some drugs
Tell judge they didn't pay the deposit, I ain't going up
Rapping is tailored for us, so the game I'm sewing up
Tum Tum and San T, Southside and the 3
Putting it down from Tayhouse, all the way to Mississippi
All the gangstas in the place, all the hustlers in the place
All the thugs in the place, put your hood in his face
I ain't scared of no nigga, I ain't scared of no bitch
I don't bar no squad, and I ain't afraid of no click
It's the million dollar man, I get it popping in this bitch
Better watch what you say, 'fore shit start dropping round this bitch
[Chorus: x2]
I'm a do something bad to ya, disrespect your set talk trash to ya
And if you get out of line, I'ma bring it quick fast to ya
Smash your head, in the concrete
And H-Town Stomp, your bitch ass to the beat
Till they see the white meat, for playing games with my gang
My Hoggs off the chain, they'll dance on your brain
In the middle of the club, like fuck it
The laws see me, and act like they ain't seen nothing
You niggas bluffing, talking hard acting like you want beef
But when I see you on the streets, you hollin' bout you want peace
One or one hundred deep, I'm crush you and them busters
Straight smash on you suckas, you punks don't wanna tussle
My nigga Tuck, say we ready to ride
The whole Southside Dallas, waiting on the Southside
H-Town to the D, we connect in the Tex'
D-S-R and Boss Hogg, don't bar no plex we'll tussle with ya
[Chorus: x2]

[interlude]
Yeah, yo, Def Squad, Full Cooperation on this one yo, total concentration
Wassup wit these cats out there?, I don't think they figured, son
I don't think they hear you son, ha ha
[Keith Murray]
Now first but not least you will respect Keith, lay a nigga down
Like a doo-rag in some grease, you must be crazy tryin to play me
I been dedicated since King Tut the third baby
Lyrical chemist rhyme minister, diminished you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it, I see y'all been writin
Still bitin, still lookin lame, half y'all niggaz still soundin the same
I'm excitin when live on stage, when receiting in lighting, frightening
lightning
Throwin thunder in chain, when i first came, I gave birth to a million MC's
In the game, who should all carry my last name
And I'm Gonna Get You Sucka like Damon Wayans, and fame like Jermaine
Bring pain and novacaine, okay y'all lil monkeys want to play?
My Squadron brings the art of war the correct way (OKAY!)
Chorus 2x
Chorus
I need your full cooperation and total attention
There's a few things I'd like to mention, these rappers out here swear they're
So appealing I, step to your business and hurt your feelings
[Erick Sermon]
Okay, well thinkin it's okay to rhyme that way, you'll be P.O.W., M.I.A.
And I'm seven steps ahead of you, five from eternity
An all that shit you kick just don't concern me, I separate the dead from
The chump, ask a nigga blunt, "Yo, how many lumps you want?"
So flavorous you could taste it, so hardcore I wrote this layin on the floor
In the basement, my style ain't no walk in the park, got mainstream MC's
Scared to rhyme after dark, an there Ain't No Half-Steppin
I'm reppin like a nuclear weapon, manifestin the Immaculate Conception
Lyrically I rape an MC like sodomy, add tragedy, to your odessy
For battle reservations call 1-900-SQUAD, frontin on us
Is like frontin on God
Chorus
[Redman]
Now when we take it there, these three niggas in the square
My squad hangs out like fourhundred pounds in braziers
My deathrow allines, bein signed then aligned to electric
So it clear like a chair in Texas, HOT, approach wit extreme caution
No horsin around when my squad abortion a sound
Our crew's like Smokey off sokey, even Little Bo Peep, your style is weak
Guard your Rollie, wit all the ice in it, I snatch the ice out and put a price
out
Cop a Benz, put my mom in it, as long as I'm alive I'mma keep the vibe
24-7, 365
Chorus 2x

[Verse 1]
Diamond colored spine
Armadillo armor that bends around the blades
Bugs in the beard
Ebony in the lungpiece
Bricks in the Timbs
Bazooka in the tooth that he's flashing at your friends
This is the lifestyle, baby
Know and sip the recipe
Not a single innocuous side up in the centerpiece
Oh my god
Journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars
[Verse 2]
Piety for the fam, embargo piggybackers
Navigate sim-city backwards
Bazooka Tooth, baby!
Zephyrs less dextrimental expect to tone down terrordome for starter crews
Like jousting Pompeii with a garden hose
If you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping Wagner
It's bodycast to Pilates class
Buckle in the Bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smacks
Drag them prophecies, be them celestine or Mothman to the bumper boat monster mash
See, the pristine kittens fiddle with new yarn
Decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn
One shan't put in long hours like Tim Leary's lava lamps
To be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands
Isolated, biological phenomenon
First nocturnally orchestrated car alarms
Y'all sketch portraits of your neighbors, tack em up without fail
See a robored pitchforks and alligator tails [?]
Offical Max Fischer Blume break cable clipper (Def)
Picket train buffer, the riverboat, and the switcher (Jux)
Pipe-dreaming that so fresh and so clean plummage
Is an appleseed of bore that resorts to Bazooka Tooth shit
You don't want me smiling at your cameras

(Kill, kill, kill)
(Kill, kill, kill
(Kill, kill, kill)
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin up in the urinal (you fuckin' homo'!)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit he gets killed (killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville ('Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (filled)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill! (Hill!)
We don't do drive-by's, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with them too!
That's the mentality here (here) that's the reality here (here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (here??)
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year? (year?)
'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen,
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it (Ah!)
God dammit, he meant it when he told you!
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville

Caught in the middle with the rhythm, you're feelin'

Intro
Bust it, bust it, Friday night swingin you know what I'm sayin
With Mista Lawnge and my man Jermaine, and Jack whose names is Joe
Check it check it check it yo c'mon
Lyrics
I been around, I been around
I been around town
Sounds you know I'm down
That many cannot get down
But not me, we kick it all day and night see
Although you know in a minute
Right now you know not who I be
So I kick it for a second
Yes I kick it for a sec
Get wreck, and double check
Got to play with your select
Name is Dres, D-are-E-S
Yes I guess that it is
Ya gotta bag of buddha well smoke a sess
I'm the type of brother that the girls always select
It's not because they're out to come
It's cause they're out to come correct
I talk about a ho, because a ho I know
And if you do the honey Tea
then I guess too you would talk so
Play me not, if my phone book is bigger
Don't get hot cause I clock the fat figure
Told ya I'm a singa got my finga on the trigga
Cause everybody hates the fly nigga
Play me not close if your jean is made of plastic
If your best to play it down
Then you should walk faster
Don't give me a pound if you bust that in your hand
Play me out never cause I came to understand
Do it to, for a minute
I do for me too
Push me up and I'll pull myself through
Watch my back and I'll watch my front
Got what I want, see-ya hate to be ya
Got a nie, got a shot, got a catch twenty-two
Damned if I don't and I'm damned if I do
Fightin over cities how they're fightin on my block
Over there is liberation over here is for a rock
No not pop rock, no not pop rock
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-after shock
Some will part fly gear, while others are suckin
I game I use to play until I learned to keep steppin
But one thring I learned, yo roll and take it
Life is what you make it

Be Bold, You Smell Me, Lil Mexico!
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head

The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
Was it cold nights that made me cold
Do the stress increase my hunger
Tell a lie then make a promise
Fish like a man niggafish, hit nigga this a fucking hit
Send a nigga home full clip,
traumatized by the whole trip
Boatload full of cocaina
Got some wolves 'round and some hyenas
Bought a AK like this bitch a nina
And I know I got a big enough demeanor (Future!)
Pourin' up the Don Perignon
Fuck a pussy, fuck a pussy 'til it's numb
Put the pussy on a nigga tongue
'Til the pussy juice runnin' down my lungs
Ain't another better feeling
Like the feeling when a nigga make it out the slums
Stackin' all my racks on racks
I got my niggas rich, I'm at the top where I belong
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
Dressed up in all black leather
Bodybag .38 special
And a bad bitch a nigga treasure
Need money on a whole 'nother level
Good time, nigga good time
Barrel longer than a good time
Never sacrifice who you are
Then you turn yourself into a star
Turn myself into a avatar
Put the OG in my 'gar
Take a penitentiary chance
That's a change, eat shrimp, steak, caviar
Bloodline is a lion
Fly nigga
Walk and say when I walk, it look like a nigga flyin'
Fuck your lies and your bullshit you tryna sell me cause I ain't buyin'
Green minded like a slave field, niggas picking green like it's cotton
Money getting' burnt, money fire
Franck Muller at the new spot
Frank mattress nigga Frank Lucas
Real life on wax
Match an ordinary funeral movie
Phenomenon when the commas come
Kill the winter and then when the summer comes
Ex con, 100 round drum, Batman the paint James Bond
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go, go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in, now love you
The way we go, go, go

We went out that night
To a club downtown

And had boomin sounds
We went in
And we were dressed to impress
Fly women and girlies
Lookin their very best
We took a seat at the bar
Feelin brand new
Frank ordered drinks, no liquor
Just plain old brew
He finished it
Then he ordered one more
And another
And another
And that made four
He seen this fly girlie
Suave and deboinaire
Light skinned complexion
With long black hair
But this girl was ug-ly
I mean her body was through
But after four drinks or more
She looked like Paula Abdul
You know what baby? You startin to look good
You startin to look REAL good
You startin to remind me of that superstar, Paula Abdul
The party was over
It was time to go
You insisted on drivin

That ain't gonna be no problem
I drive better when I feel nice (Are you sure man?)
Are you kidding me man?
That stuff in there, that stuff in there taste like fruit punch
I could drink that all night
So you got in your car
Swervin on the road
There was a cop in the bushes
On radar patrol
The light turned green
And you decided to stop
It turned red
You took off
And got pulled over by a cop
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink

By the time I got to Motor Vehicle, Motor Vehicle was closed

On a Friday night
Wit your friends gettin wasted
Just feelin nice
You continued to drink
When you know you should stop
The next thing you know
Your behind is caught
Your body gets numb
So you slow up the pace
Your mouth gets watery
And you can't feel your face
You finally make it home
And the fun begins
You try to pass out
But here comes the spins
So you turn and toss
Then you toss and turn
Your head gets light
And your chest starts to burn
So you lay on your stomach
And you tuck in your chin
Pail by your bedside
Now the breathing begins
Oh, oh God, just let me get through this last one
If you let me make it
If you let me make it through the night God
I promise I'll never have another drink again
I'll never drink again, as long as I live
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it homes
You had too much to drink
You overdid it
Hey yo this is EPMD tellin you not to drink and drive
Cause ain't nuttin cool about chillin in a coffin six feet under
YouknowwhatI'msayin?
Yo, this is Frank B
And learn from others mistakes homes!
And don't let peer pressure get to you
Cause it costs you, or your life, or somebody else's life
In the long run
And it's like that
And if you don't believe you can get the bozack
See-ya!
5000

[Verse]
You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth
[Pre-Hook]
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me
[Hook] (x2)
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for

No mic check?
[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I see dead buffalos, on the plains of the horizon
Electromagnetic energy fields like M. Bison
Through the air flyin, like black crows in a circle
Before the people of the land start dyin
Nature's siren, even the rivers won't act right
The full moon was a flashlight, in my past life
When traveling the winding path at night
Unraveling the blinding blasting site
Chickens come home to roost and find dead buzzards
Layin next to the head of cousins, sisters and brothers
Fathers and mothers, daughters and sons
Only the vultures profit, I could still see the blood run
The slaughter of loved ones, hated for bein different
Elders were slain, strangled with their talismans
Killed the body, the spirit started driftin
Destroyed physically, but the souls were ever livin
[Chorus]
Thank you! For takin my land and food
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose
Thank you! For killin my seed
Givin me disease, then blamin me - thank you!
Thank you! For takin my land and food
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose
Thank you! For killin my seed
Givin me disease, and then blamin me - thank you!
[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
I took my shahada (one) and gazed in the drama
God against the devils, Shaolin versus Lama
We fought felons, clashed with Magellan
Baby heads were crushed and bust like small melons
Wishin these demons would be baptized or banished
In my dream I woke up in Jamaica speakin Spanish
The night the earth cried when the good ship arrived
Blood on the shores transformed to Crimson Tide
I built with Crazy Horse, made a black sun spack
The smoke shack was beat on by drum back stack
The beetles were baffled, by the state of bondage
Showin love like Pocahontas savin John Smith
Convinced by the truth of the past, since the body splash
Used the Atlantic as a skeleton raft
Unafraid, I went to a cave to meditate
And talk to my celestial mind and elevate
[Chorus]
Thank you! For takin my land and food
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose
Thank you! For killin my seed
Givin me disease, then blamin me - thank you!
Thank you! For takin my land and food
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose
Thank you! For killin my seed
Givin me disease, and then blamin me - thank you!
[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
The land was raped, scorn, torn and withered
Later on you would praise portraits of these killers (cheese!)
Even made holidays for this unholy act (Happy Thanksgiving)
I'm the voice of the dead! You can't hold me back (no!)
Dead buffalos, similar to us now
In the name of gain on these plains we get bust down
What up, HOW, you think there be reparations?
We been touched down, so make preparations (now)
Under water holdin breath I dodge piranha fish
With fright, wishin to die was tomorrow's wish
I heard the mountain weep, skulls smash against clif with sticks
We clash with the madmen, from the good ship
We did nothing but show love to a stranger
We were repaid with murder, rape and anger
Buffalos died, the lions would hide, the bears cried
Savagely speakin the pain of the tribe
This reality was actually the worst dream
The death of nature, I heard the earth scream
Dead buffalos - empty rivers and streams
Dead buffalos - too many killers and thieves
[Chorus]
Thank you! For takin my land and food
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose
Thank you! For killin my seed
Givin me disease, then blamin me - thank you!
Thank you! For takin my land and food
Thank you! For rapin my women, puttin me in a noose
Thank you! For killin my seed
Givin me disease, and then blamin me - thank you!

Niggas might rob me
See niggas we ball with car figures
Papers dial mine, clothes custom figure
Matchin' Jon Gotti to roll through customs nigga
Roll the custom built shit, I bust them clips
Niggas trust my lips, while they suck they dicks
Plus the Kiss be the Long Goodnight
Murderous bitch be the wrong in spiked-typed, what
Price right, be that song, the right type
But only if Havoc and P spittin' wit' me
And they say they gon' see that C.B. nice wit' it
Hinnesy and Rimmy, and give me some Ice wit' it
Shake down, niggas'll throw some dice in it
Put your Money on Chuck or in 9-9, you're fucked
Try your luck, stress this red-head
I mix blood in my dye, like my family ties
[Chorus (Havoc & Charli)]
When you in the mix with this shit, bitch
Skin and bones, nothing but Infamous
Do your hard beat, rapper lay a bid
Other dogs posted up over here

Niggas be frontin', where my bitches at what?
Yo they don't want it

Scared, get back nigga, but if not, it's cool
Cause right here is where it's at
[Havoc]
Yo, when I foul out on lab mouse
One nut and I'm out
Ain't tryin' to stick around, let a nigga catch me out of bound
Don't give a fuck about a rumor
Know how I get down
Let my man's do it, he gots to right to it
Known Jay come through the door, still like they "Who this?"
Don't got beef, but got niggas, serious ones
Make sure a nigga here, plus lasted wars
And stay countin' all that cash when I'm fuckin' wit' 'Un'
Fuck around with my funds, got a bring a gun
Please don't make me have to puncture ya lungs
[Ty Nitty]
Cause we the ones rockin' 'em, the ones toppin' 'em
Gold bars unpredictable, like Mr. Cal' shockin' 'em
We heavenly like BIG, Pac and them
Mobb Deep and Charli Baltimore, who's toppin' 'em?
Who's lockin' 'em, who's hotter then them?
It's like a dice game and Crack Tito trotterin' them
[Chorus]
When you in the mix with this shit, bitch
Skin and bones, nothing but Infamous
Do your hard beat, rapper lay a bid
Other dogs posted up over here
Niggas fuckin' up, where my niggas at huh?

Cause right here is where it's at
[Prodigy]
Yo, all and together we gon' rush the front door
Get at them
They dumpin' our songs, so now it's on
Infamous, my niggas pop clips to this
And fight to it
Niggas respect it, it's like we magnetic
It's like the last thing you want is drama
Go at the girls, have a good time, don't make it a problem
While we pop bottles of Mo'
Burn down bottles of 'dro
Smack that ass of models and ho's
Rappin', all ya'll some rag old bunnies
Ready to jump off
I'm on the side fondlin' this Marcy
Black car be gone, Q.B. bitches ready to brawl
Charli Baltimore payin' dues, got it 'em balled
At the bar slashin' bitches
Over some niggas
From a Wayne cell, we stuff back in '96
Spaid like... swallow the Gin, we musclin' in
Play ya card kid, don't be a talkative Marvin
[Chorus]
When you in the mix with this shit, bitch

Do your hard beat, rapper lay a bid

Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin but we talkin cash
Poppin bottles then we poppin tags
You know we came with the money bags
Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin but we talkin cash
Poppin bottles and poppin tags
You know we came with the money bags
Cake! We came wit it
You know we came with the money bags
Cake! We came wit it
You know we came with the money bags
Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin, we talkin cash
Call me AKK came wit it
Old school money, big daddy came wit it
She throw it back, I'm throwin' stacks
Told that bitch, take 3 days to count it back
If it's real, tat my name on it
Throw it, blue dot pour it
Smoke like I go, dirty Sprite I pour it
Coke Boys you know, pay like you owe em
What you need I got, smoking weed, drinkin blue dot
Never sober
Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin but we talkin cash
Poppin bottles then we poppin tags
You know we came with the money bags
Shawty bust it open then I bust er back
Niggas talkin but we talkin cash
Poppin bottles and poppin tags
You know we came with the money bags
Cake! We came wit it
You know we came with the money bags
Cake! We came wit it
You know we came with the money bags
Freedom is for real, you lame niggas playin wit it
Menace to this shit, just like old dog, it came wit it
Inside all white, like I put cocaine in it
I just bend er over, scarecrow, no brain wit it
Wrist froze, I breeze it in
So slick, I slide out
Headed to the Sean Combs honey cone hideout
Yo bitch be tail gatin, killed that, new tricks
I just hit shawty then pick up them shell cases
Saint Nick, I came with the bags
Slidin down the chimney straight up on that ass
And that pussy up like a top with a slap
Really I've been sober but I'm high above the cash

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogain
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
We did it! Yay!
Nigga you so thirsty

Pop goes the flow of the weasel
Strapped with an Ox full of diesel
Trapped in the desert with eagles
Thoughts of ghetto a capellas in cathedrals
Spilling heavy gospels with cheaters
Twisted up, I'm high off the reefer
Lost beyond regions of logic and reason, just being
We high so be not so obedient
To society's laws and limitations
Lost in this ghetto population
I'm just another face that's facing
All types of like stereotypes and hatred
But I ain't going to wait that and get all stressed out
I'm just trying to make it and strive with my
Hell went through changes, emotions
Inner thoughts and rages
Relieved and released on pages
My life in it's cycle and stages
Seen through descriptions in nature
Ever since back in the days
When niggaz was loving and hating
Everyone trapped and two thou
Caught The Matrix with diseases of judgment
That breed through the hatred conceived through these scenes
And then painted
Now what really defines the line of a hater
And what defines the line is someone even greater
And what makes somebody jump that line trying to take it
Wrapped behind enemy lines trying to make it
Mind in another universe while my physical's stuck on the earth
In these inner city mazes
Yo yo yo, lay that shit down
What is you, a clown? You wanna see a little kid get shot?
Give me two good reasons so I don't smack you
For flashing a gun in my face just to get some respect
All in all, it's all love and I'm here to protect
You only twelve years old someone'll snap your neck
You let your pants sag but your thoughts gotta pull up
Mental calisthenics, lazer brains can't push up
Or even sit up to fight for what they believe in
He thought about it I said, "Peace, keep breathing"
I see him mumbling shrugging his shoulder
He probably cursing but he know better
He had a beretta with the rubbed off serial digit
And I know he got it from Carlos the Midget
The only cat I know cold enough to hustle shit to kids
Him an' his three man team formed eight arm squid
And they laughed in the face of any possibilities of being
Through and dead
We're all from the same ghettos
And these are the same hollow tips that knock nearly out of stilettos
He cocked first, I cocked second and in that exact second
Both of the gats burst
Man, this is your last fucking chance
Fuck you, this is your last chance
Live and orchestrated from blocks
Where animals grew up as four lazers we twist mad sabres
Rock the sky pimping jays all day blazes
Wrapped in these inner city mazes
Relaxing on corners where cats stay wasted
Choking on 4-0 basics, you taste it
My life's an oasis, this trife's what I make it
Straight through these days spitting raps that laced it
I'm just trying to blaze these mics on the stages
Write on these pages like life as a scene in amazement
Like I'ma stay blazing mics until I'm fading
Off of this surface to return to my nature
In the meantime, spit flows and cop acres
Put my fam in it with shelter that's spacious
Everyday life yo, is rap in these mazes
I'm just trying to make it go slowly
Dissolves in my belly, got me aching
Niggaz up the block, yo I swear, trying to take it
But I'ma stay patient watching every move made in the jungle
It's live trying to strive in this struggle
New York state of mind, that's the home that I come to
Nothing but pigeons living, trapped in this system
Bleeding, screaming, phoenix
We needed that scrap for that meaning to stay shining
Trying to escape out of hellfire's and lakes
Brain on another plane gliding through acid rain
That's stress trying to master pain
Spit words, not to hurt but to bash your brain
That's the worth of an MC wrapped in the vein
New York

So, chain danglers, are in danger
When I skate wit ya ice like the Rangers, assume later
Boss bitch though, goin out like Tomb Raider

Me and G O D, from see O see, like got dough see O D
A S A P, A S A P

Keep a chick in the whip, gettin licked the six

Niggas want to make deals, na na I want work out
Now murk out, before you get cursed out
Bangin they fun, same as the sun
Hidin from the church when you slang to the nuns
Chumps come through with giraffe and orangatang guns
Vetty vest, you petty theft, you seem soft
I'm seven judges up in Supreme Court
Mean thoughts all over a teen porch
Wait, don't have to tell you shit
Matter fact, pat him down, who the hell you wit?
Yo you wack money, wait around all day for pack money
Get a gold chain talkin bout you bout to have money

HOOK

One.. Two.. One..Two..Three Lets GO..
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Back in the mud again, I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away
[Verse 1]
It's just that country boy, city slick
Hot boy, temperament
Add the pony, add the flame
Either way it's an event
If it's me consider it
Pardon the coincidence, even though they mumble at me
Suckers keep they distances
Father, Kay Hey
What's that they say
Hip hop redneck that's a safe place
Say what makes you comfortable
With me cause I like it here
How about a rural dwelling, urban music pioneer
Turn it up, let it bang
Run with me, I bet you can't
Took too much to make it float
Never will I let it sink
So we reinvented it
Boy are we generous
Hoping that my moment pass
I can see the end of it
25 years of life, I was born yesterday
Loving life, doing right, earning every breath I take
Standing in the mud again, cause it seems to pay me well
Playing with my not so distance cousins from the ATL AHHH..
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Ah Yea, Ah Yea
Press it up
Ship it out
Call the pony
Rent it out
Everything I Am today
Is what I've really what I've been about
Athens Georgia Resident
Native of Lagrange though
I don't love the Peach State, brothers say it ain't so
Naw, Sir, In Fact it's quite the opposite
Loving y'all from Brunswick, Up to the metropolis
Can't forget about my Betty Betty in the ?.
That put them triple X's at the end of Andy's Monica
How can I run from, everything that made me
Knowing all the love I get is appreciated greatly
Now witness something truly inconceivable
Bubba International, but still he kept it regional
Trying to make my momma proud
Ricky Lathens see me smile
Gotta make sure this next CD is the fire
Making sure everyone one of my talented associates gets what they deserve
Nothing short that's appropriate YEA!!!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Get your cup, fill it up
Soda don't appeal to us
But if your broke, do what you can't that alone still enough
Help us out if your rich, cause we about to pitch a bitch
Just stop by the store and grab a case of that, a six of this
Hey Betty get it ready, cause you daddys in route
Let her join the Beat Club, peep that lil trim out
Have her screaming new south, with out pulling loot out
He always wonder what you doing, let him wonder who now
At the end of the day, I will have no regrets
Got it done on every front, and I ain't even focused yet
At the bottom of the pond, swimming with them mud cats
If you dive in I'm perusing for a grudge match
Spell It out L-E-G-E-N-D, I still believe
What ever goal God set for me, indeed I will achieve
Either in this life, for in the next
Whether drinking Gin or Becks
Bubba fin, to bring it home, still you can send a check
[Chorus]

Uhh..

It's the questions (what..) it's the questions boy
It's the questions (What?) it's the questions c'mon

{*continues to fade with ad libs..*}

Against an attacker I will boldly take my stand
Because my heart will show fear for no man
But for a broken heart I run with freight
Scared to be blind in a vulnerable night
I believe this fear is in every man
Some will acknowledge it, others will fail to understand
There is no fear in a shallow heart
Because shallow hearts don't fall apart
But feeling hearts that truly care
Are fragile to the flow of air
And if I am to be true then I must give my fragile heart
I may receive great joy or you may return it ripped apart

Drink some wine, smoke a blunt with me
Call up some friends, and play this CD
Merry Christmas to all of you
I say yeah, Merry Christmas to all of you
Silent night, po-police line
Stop the engine, keep your head inside
Cops surround me, pistols in hand
Three outstanding warrants for just suffering
Sleep in the county jail, can't post no bail
(I wanna wish you a) merry Christmas to all of you
(holiday is f**ked up)
Merry Christmas (you gotta have a good time anyway) to all of you
I said, yeah, merry Christmas
Si-silent night (he said silent night), handcuffs are tight (have you ever had the handcuffs tight?)
People staring at me at the red, red light
Ninety-five hundred I've seen a far
Past higher robbing the custody car
Sleep in the county jail, can't, can't post no bail

From the bottom I got up, to the top of the pro's
From the gutter to the shutter, trimmed out in gold
Life bless my soul, god bless my mold
Nothing less than the best, so the rest is old
Don't wanna play chess, wanna lock and load
Wanna tag some toes, wanna send you home
It ain't about the pain
Tell 'em what's my name
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Look
From the bottom I started, so it's nothing that you can say to me
A product of where I grew up, and it's the newest slavery
People see you trying hard, like why you wanna play with me
I bring them heaters out, somebody better pray for me
Cause all I know is this money, I gotta have it
These suicidal thoughts getting bad, I'm getting madder
Uh, they say the good die young, I put the peddle to the medal hit the gas then I'm gone
Now I'm front line at the court, and I'm 'bout to take a shot
I pull it up, cock it back, let it fly
Now I'm watching for the back board
And when they say the world is yours, I just let them know
That I'm just trynna score

If you ever been through it, then I'm knowing you gotta feel it
You witnessing the struggle from the realest, what the deal is
They trynna lock me down, but they created a monster
I'm beating down your block, and nobody can't stop us
(You was over there talking all kinds of tough
While you sipping on your little bit of "pick me up"
When you say you like to play a little fistacuff
So when the whistle puffs, I'm gonna call your bluff)
Words from a wise man, never let 'em see you hand
In the end, I bet they all gon' understand
You can't stop what you can't see, standing here is only me
So place your bet and gone prepare for your defeat
(I caught a new jack, it said kid guard ya check
There's a brother over there, that wanna bounce your neck
Ain't you 'fraid of that, watch you fade to black)

I hear we livin' in the last days
Its revelation and you best get right with god
Or else is waitin', the world is comin' to an end
Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm
We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like whats happenin'
Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested
Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested
And the lowest percentage rate,
In my city damn near the lowest in the state
You can equate that to the state funds
That ain't breakin' down right,
Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right
So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them doors down, they killin' my city yall
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else is gonna do it its gonna have to be me
[Chorus: Junior Reid]
If it was up to me,
No gun, no crack, or whore could of comin' in our community
If it was up to me,
You couldn't have no war between Tupac and B.I.G
If it was up to me,
They couldn't lock up Shyne and they couldn't lock up Emcee
If it was up to me,
You wouldn't have no aids and you wouldn't have no H.I.V
First of all the projects is fucked up
And it ain't just with the drugs,
We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs
They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us
We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us
They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause if you sell crack
Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that
They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch
But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case
Development is good for the hood yeah thats what you tellin' us
But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man
So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
Its hurting to see how they treat the poor
They have so much and still they still want more
I see my people everyday on the floor
[Chorus]
Its time to educate the people man, free school and college
So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge
education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously
Everybody makin' money everybody smilin'
Motherfuckers ain't eatin', them motherfuckers wildin'
Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America
Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit
How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty
How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty
And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Cant turn 'em loose in the streets, cause they dying in 'em
And all this naked ass sex man you trippin', fuck love
Im livin life you aint gonna catch your boy slippin'
You say your boy trippin', I'm just keepin' in it G
Cause you could see how good the world would be if it was up to me
[Chorus]
So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know

Can I touch you baby
Come here baby, yeah
Can I
Can I touch you
Make you feel so good
I know you want me to
So sweet my goodness, love so sexy
Won't you come and talk to me
Can I speak to you make you feel good
I know you want me to so sweet
Goodness, love so sexy
Won't you walk over to me
In the middle of the night
You walk into my room
The streetlight silhouettes your face
And all of me
Consumes a special part of me
There's a lonely part of you
And in this we'll find happiness
In a little thing called truth
Can I
[Chorus 1]
Can I touch you there
Fingers through your hair
Baby don't be scared
'cause I've got you
Where you need to be
Hold you tenderly
Something you won't forget
[Chorus 2]
Can I touch you
Make you feel so good
I know you want me to
So sweet, my goodness love so sexy
Won't you come and talk to me
[Chorus 3]
Can I speak to you
Make you feel good
I know you want me to
So sweet, goodness love so sexy
Won't you walk over to me
All the time I spent
Lookin' in your eyes
I don't feel time is wasted
I swear I am not lying
Lying here just to take advantage of you
Do you understand
This is something I want to do
Can i...
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Come over here
And take my hand
Oh don't be afraid

Aiyyo my song's on, I gotta get my grub on some to-to

We gettin more dough, off the books (you gettin gelly)
Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin gelly)
You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin wit mah cheddah
Hardrock, ever since, junior high suela
Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up
I'm fed up, niggaz want to bring it -- WHATEVER!
I'ma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off
with a gre-nade, now you flappin, like a mermaid
Yappin off, bitch you cough at the lips
while I'm at the bar, baggin, the bartender tips
Then I bag this chick, with a, "Hi," and the eye
She did the butterfly, rubbin her ass, against my buttonfly
I could ALREADY imagine my shit stuck inside
Everytime I strike, haters be like, "Dat fucking guy!"
Chorus: Beatnuts + Yellaklaw
How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow
It don't take much for us to let the metal holla
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla
Big Ju, dime lo conllo, how we do?, how we do? (How we do)
(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!)
Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?)
Nigga whatchu gonna do? (What, yo)
[JuJu]
Here's to my pollyin niggaz who campaign
To the killers who be lovin the chicas and champagne
Thugs who get wild in the club and snatch chains
Players who be pimpin the hoes with no brains
Front watch a nigga get shot from close range
The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change
Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain?
Cause you walkin outta here breathin is insane
Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash
You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass
I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass
Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin kneepads
Now the beef has, gotten over your head
It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs

Cause for real, there ain't nothin but crooks in here, nigga
Chorus -> Beatnuts last line "Whatcha gon' do when Beatnuts come through baby!"

What is joy without pain
If its nothing left what is there to gain
Whoever said sunshine brings happiness
has never danced in the rain
I've worked for everything that I've obtained
Looking at the clouds from the window of my plane
All I could do is smile mama look how far I've came
Proud Crazy cause it started as a dream
Wow Shows that everything is everything
I Remember days of Thinkin things would never change
Taron And Tasha Talking about my shoes because the name
Crying Walkin out the door to school cause I'm ashamed
If only someone hada told me time will bring a change
To always cease the moment because nothing stays the same
That I would some day wish that I could do it all again
There will be a time I found it cool to not complain
I Learned from the wise to never shoot before I aim
Game Judge trees by the fruit that hang
Bang Blood bleeding from a wounded brain
Another public school student dead at 17
Dang The younger generation won't sustain
Everybody Blinded by the diamonds and the chains
My homie say we Violent cause the climate Ain't the same
Why is everybody so afraid to find a lane
Why you so concerned who define you as a lame
It's hard to not be carnal when the mind is in them chains
I guess that's just the science to the game
I work for every single fan I got
the crew I thought was rooting for me left me out to rot
I know Alotta cats was hoping I would be forgot
Dropped ? I walked away so GOD could be my rock
Cousin Onna phone screaming drizzy gotcha spot
I guess the road to glory want enough to shut his chops
Went Ova many heads it wasn't that it wasn't hot
And then I dropped an elephant now everybody shocked
Success is not defined by what you got
But by the things you overcome when you been through a lot
Don't mean that you successful jus because you at the top
You possibly been stepping Onna mini toe but when you drop
You gone wish that they would reach they hands to catch you but they not
This life has been a blessing even if I never popped
Who knew the kid that grew up in the ghetto with no plot
Would someday be Makin cheddar off the letter that he jot
And still gone put my mama Inna spot
Gone make it out the ghetto whether you believe or not
Gone give my all forever I was taught to never stop
Until I'm settled and they puttin rose pedals on my box
The pedal never stops
The kettle or the pot
Was taught to never settle
It's better with no Geppetto on the top
Freedom to do whatever whenever I can't be boxed you
Get no respect in this industry when you not they
Slinging Salami care less if you eat or not where they
Kick in the door break the hinges or pick the locks just
Make sure that it's done in the memory of PAC
Time is ticking minutes running out jus like my pops
Father thank god the inning was man enough to adopt
Though everything was a limit he never left me to rot
17 I remember Tellin Nem we could box
Rebellious in front of dell and relatives that would watch
And get to see all the helling and yelling for me to stop
I'm probably the blame for every gray hair my mama got
Would go back and forth with a woman but couldn't pick up a mop
Nobody could tell me nothing my ego was through the top
My virginity had been broken all of the women was on my Joc
Depressed because I was broke I needed to make some gwop
I Went out and bought me some dope but I never could sale a rock
My cousins was Onna oath and he would get Em off on the block
And when he did he spent all the cash and Neva gave me my chop
I don't mean to bring up the past but that's one I never forgot
We look back on it now and laugh but when it happened it had me hot
Because I was so full of wrath I'm surprised I never was shot
I then done some things in my past that would have a priest Lookin shocked
But I've over come all the bad now I'm on my way to the top
Because GOD is my rod and staff and forever gone be my rock

OK First off, you a bitch nigga

Amazin phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow
The rays that range from Asia way to Rio De Janeiro
A craze you crave? but work today's the day that in a major way
I'll make you say oh look he saved the day and also paved the way (hooray)
Rockin? my crew like razor blades today and days away from now okay, okay
I'm like a laser ray keepin the stains? away
and dangerous ways rappin the phrase that pays
all things just ain't a phase but ageless ways a cagey great displays
yo hey, this ain't a game, so stays awake
cause if you came to play you'll all behave insane
After we change the game it won't reamin the same
(I'll fade away!!!) So make your disc and play this tape in your Camaro
Amazin phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow
The verbal God, I throw a murder all my foe and kill 'em
But learnin all and so I'm gorowing while I'm learnin wit em
Infernal I'll explode returnin out the globe about to blow
Now get up out here yo, see head on out the zones that I patrol
Rock and roll might tear you out the soul like blunts and alcohol
I knock your whole toboggan for a loop and now the doubt will flow
I'm not the pro you want to knock cause on the real I got the glow
Cosmic flows as I suppose that's how its supposed to be
and got to go!!! How'd ya know? Intuition
I was on the old safe surface figure out your purpose that's impossible
But logic will disturb the thought or focus what its not is all about
the grow about the kind of onus only god can know
I rock it for the chocolate, for the awkward for the thoughtless
in your home or at your office
I'm your early morning coffee so who got the ball?
We roll with Navajos with double barrels
Amazin phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow

Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts;Explain Poolside; 0 for 1 and don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat. (To Moms:) "it's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half."
She said "i'll keep you in my prayers," I said "i need to hide a body," she said "ok honey, talk to you on friday."
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter. according to the blood-and-water chapter. weird
Who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway? probably some surly dad; only child, 30 cats. looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past. except it doesn't always work like that
Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt; where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn; I told them "you will grow to be something inventive and electric; you are healthy, you are special, you are present." then I let them go
Oh
You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pictures; who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material;
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a...that's better, here we here we go. disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized, contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! nevermind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? don't play
Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark where the grape vines climb a convenient barn; I told them "you will grow to be something tenacious and exalted; you are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded." then I let them go
Oh
I have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish it's history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worse enemy since the very genesis of rebels
Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand, where the low tide showcased a promised land. I told them "you will grow to be something dynamic and impressive; you are patient you are gallant you are festive."
Then I let them go
Oh
(On and on and on and on...)

[Missy]
Bus-a-Bus baby-baby! Now
[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
Pop yo' collars like this
Bottles up like this

[Chorus 1: Missy Elliott]
See the ass? Touch me right there
Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there
Make me lose my mind baby? Touch me right there

See how I'm drilling 'em baby?
It's Bus-a-Bus back bitch, I'm killing 'em crazy
We off the Relaxic, I'm spilling the gravy
Got every club packed thick, creating a frenzy
To be the latest greatest for all you niggas from gazing
Bugatti off white tan, interior pastry
See my swagger sharp like that, these niggas amaze me
As a matter a fact just salute me and praise me
Enough of that
[Missy Elliott]
We be up in the club, niggas sporting them minks
Tipsy in the club, nigga buying 'em drinks
Walk around looking like our shit don't stink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink
[Busta Rhymes]
Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up and I'm loving ya hairdo
The way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checking for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to
Now she was saying
[Chorus Two: Missy Elliott]
See the ass? Touch me right there
Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there
Is that Dr. Dre baby? Touch me right there
Party over here, ain't shit over there!

Come on give it to me
We got some shit for that ass
Come on give it to me
We got some shit for that ass girl
[Busta Rhymes]
Bounce back, brand new on the scene what?
Took a little minute, I'm back with the re-up
Switched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut
Shorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up
I love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up
It's getting hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up
Amazed by the pinky, neck, and wrist be gleaming up
How I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up
I see you liking everything, you see me and you
You frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo
The hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you
Ya girl looking like she wit' it, she can come in too
You get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move
I'm bangin in the truck, and let her watch in the rear view
See we don't really care about the niggas who came through
Over there 'cause over here, see I'ma show ya how we do
So check it baby
[Chorus 1]
[Busta Rhymes & Missy]
See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here
That's if we toss bottles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, floss models, that's how we do it over here
Listen, rare throttles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, ice collars, that's how we do it over here nigga
See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here (over here)

[Hook:]
Think I'm Wayne
You say you wanna fight nigga swing
You say you wanna blows pipes nigga bang
I'm ridin in that Fighting Liu Kang
That's why I can fuck your wife and you can't
Young Batman Bruce Wayne
Don't make me torch it nigga blue flames
In that big body ridin two lanes
& I'm grindin hard like I'm fucking Wayne nigga
Like I'm Wayne nigga
[Verse 1:]
This Back From The Dead 2 this ain't Tha Carter 3
You owe me money I want a apology
I want your fingers so you cannot count to 3
We pullin up in trilogies we poppin 3
I'm never studying a nigga no astrology
Walk up in the mall like I just hit the lottery
& I'm still rollin dice no monopoly
I can't be controlled this ain't no colosseum
Don't fuck with boys this ain't no everybody-ology
I only speak money they only talk shit
[?] examine money [?]
But when we bring these guns up acknowledge these
[Hook:]
[Verse 2:]

I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I'll shit on you! Girl you know, its true
I'll shit on you! Bitch or man, its true
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef, I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin'
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin' (I'll shit on you!)
I'll shit on you!
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!
I'm a alcoholic, with the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'm a keep eatin' 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin' wit (your twelve year old) baby sitter (ha ha ha)
And all women ain't shit, only good for cookin', cleanin'
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin' the shit how borin' it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin' (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles danglin' (ow, ow)
My need I stay stranglin, I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest
Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fightin' Peablo Bryson (I'll shit on you)
So what you hollerin' and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!
Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too (*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child (I'll shit on you!)
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you
You heard me
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D-12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you
Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you

Yeah, welcome to Amityville (Detroit, nigga!)
The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols (Why is that?)
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See I'm backwards, I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, they musta been wanting to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the 44 scattered over they porch
Busting pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryna break your neck to conversate? Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you
You and your ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful and I ain't gotta lie to you
Stepped in the door, waving the 44
Blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
They call my tongue ya-yo, but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
The clip slider, love to blast a Mag
You a fag, you love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta (Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggas sound like Jigga but act like Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this tec until nothing remains
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
The only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
Cause I don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creeping
Waking you up with AK's while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather than need one and not have it, I married this Glock-matic
You know the sound when I'm spinning round
Spitting these rounds from four pounds
While the whole crowd screaming as loud
From they mouths as they possibly allow?
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shooting at 5-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like *Columbine kids* from Colorado
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
This nine'll turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah's Witnesses, think before they knock (Sorry, sorry!)
It'll make your grandmother come outta her purse
It'll make Limp Bizkit, get rid of Fred Durst
It'll make Holyfield start fighting
It'll make Mase say fuck church and go back to writing
It'll make Shyne say he sound like Biggie Smalls
It'll make R. Kelly, give respect to Aaron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walking
It'll make a dog with no voice, suddenly start barking
It'll make a nun turn to a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull, turn to a fucking mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the Holy Qu'ran (Need Jesus!)
It'll make Ike stop beating Tina
It'll make Slim Shady fall back in love with Christina
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Del]
Up front, introducing my man Pep Love
[Pep Love]
My introduction:
It's such an unbelievable pleasure
For you to treasure;
And much needed too
Make it phat though
on another plateau-
You begining to begining to groove;
I do it natural
As we get Jazzy with classy shit
To make them hard ass rappers wanna blast me (buck buck)
Cause I exemplify a typified mac
In actin like the shit nigga
Mashin rappers with a passion
When I get Tip and Tribe flashion lyrics
I smash your spirits
Like a big disappointment
But this here shit will surprise ya
Devise a plan:
The pipsqueaks get tweaked
cause of the size of demand
So if you wanna measure up
then press your luck
Cause when I'm in the cut
Man there ain't no catchin up
I bet ya never heard a nigga with a bigga this flow
Bigga this bro
gettin ate like a clitoris?
No.
I never could'a seen it-
I rip a rapper's balls off
To make him scream when its convenient.
Hear ye hear ye
Clearly we're the
Undisputed ones that you get mad at when you hear me
Pompous comp. just barely even registered on the meter
Cause we the niggas that they checkin for
Me and you or, you and him
Ruinin' them
Doin men in
When I'm cluing them in
On the one
[Del]
Ya two... three, four
[Q-Tip]
Now niggas know I got lyrics out the anal
And any move that you make could be fatal
The poet that shows it:
and some of y'all niggas know it when ya
Grab the mic and you can't recite
Yo that gets me irate when ya can't debate
But wait- Now ya niggas think that I'm ya runnin' mate?
Naw phukk that, 'cause when I grab the baton I'm gone (zoom)
All around the track like a runnin maniac (damn)
You babblin your babblin son; what the phukk?
Anybody here rap that doesn't go buck?
But can you grab the mic and kick ill shit? (like)
Stun'em with the verbs, instead of using clips.
Check it: I flip styles by the dozen;
I-could-even-[too fast] that I was but I wasn't
You MC's are slipping into rigor mortis
Give it up please
And just support this;
I got styles that are legendary
Even in the clink
Lyrically I'm like,
What the phukk you think?
Cause I'm down with the D-E-L
So what the hell?
[Del]
(Haha!)
I never come from the temple a simple rap
Cause your raps poor
I'm on track
I lap yours
Collapse yours
Elapse forever
You're never gonna get better bitin' my friend
But I lend a hand helping
MC's yelping like puppies (Arf! Arf!)
Their rhymes are simple
My rhymes are roughed up
Like a duffle bag
mags on my wheels squeal
Peel out towards your head
While others bust lead
That's dead
I beat your head in the resin when the pipe hits the buds in my
chamber
My rhymes are never tamer
Perpetrators I'ma hurt ya later/after
On the path of danger
I got fangs not bangs
like a bitch which I use to puncture
With punctuation-
And mutation
Racin' like my thoughts
Bust shots to scatter
And my latter lets me elevate
Over MC's that are hella fake
My reaction to your rappin' is laughin
It has been for askin they get their ass kicked
Cause they're plastic
I'm bringing lyrical lacerations
That you're tastin
Painful I mame foes
Metaphorically
Historically used the hip hop
To make your neck pop
Naw the eyes cause I kick the modern style
(Modern style, haha!)
[Cut:]
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
The undisputed ones that you get mad at
When you . . . grab the mike and you can't recite

[Verse]
And this verse is just a method to communicate
Stunt on everybody just so you can hate
I think I'm the one, I'll show you why then let you debate
So direct, shoot it straight
If you just heard about me then you're stupid late
Get right or get left ho, choose a fate
Follow no one I move at my own pace, you can wait
Notice how you stop touching bread like you're losing weight
One day you will see why I'm truly great
I will be on the road till I'm old like Willie Nelson is back
20k for a verse you need some help on a track
And I swear I've been all the way to hell and I'm back
Without a cosign at all I put myself on the map
I was chilling with a girl that I just met
Mid conversation got impatient so I asked her can we fuck yet?
Guess that she was upset
That was about the time she stormed off, steaming mad
She was bad but I just let
Her go, why you sweat girls like a fur coat
In the summertime? You're a nerd bro
Never leave work never furlough
Think you're fucking with me? K, sure bro
Ready all times say the word though
Sippin' drinking merlot, started drinking early
Still the same Gerald half killer, half nerdy
So by my 20's it will be one hell of a journey
Bob Dylan told me don't trust no one over 30
Damn, draped in St. Laurent and Supreme
Amount of money that I spend on what I want is obscene
All surreal how we live this good off of a dream
And I swear I do it all for the team
Drunk off of the Hen
Truly feel I'm the coldest alive
All I do is work, focus, and strive
Split a swisher, roll a fatty I'mma smoke this and drive
I'm a threat, now some of you can only hope to survive
Grab a glimpse I'm as rare as it gets
Forget whoever else you might've thought was apparently next
Out here and I'm blessed
I come to town and every girl in the city's at my show and all the parents get stressed
I'm maneuvering with flair and finesse
Working out so I could carry the west
I'll prepare for the test and I'm ready after 5 sets
Lift the whole bay with my biceps
Caution if you try to follow my steps
You'll trip and fall get exhausted and collapse
Most of these haters carry germs so I'm cautious giving daps
I just can't fuck with everyone my circle stays the same size
Enjoy the lifestyle that fame buys
After party is at Drai's in Vegas where they have the view
Got some girls, grab a few but only bring the baddest through
Rappers imitate the style I'm not even mad at you
I'm not even throwing shade, I just overshadow you
Yeah I'm in my own lane, run my own pace
Chasing nobody marathon my own race
I do it for the bay area that's home base
They try to run next to us but there ain't no space
I feel like life just switched to hyperspeed though as of recent
The difference between yourself and me is you just decent
A garden full of flowers grew its way up through the cement
If I ever said I'm never scared just know I really mean it
I dreamed about the top I had a vision and I seen it
If you know the work comes first than you and I are in agreement
And this is a long haul but I work harder than them all
So come back in 5 years and we can talk about achievement

[Esham talking]
Since day one, I been pushin' A1

A-1 Yola, Caine and baking soda
Takin' your orders, I'm the bolder promoter
Went from rocks to 8 balls, half Oz's
Full Onions to QP's, a afee to a half a B
Now I'm in the streets of the D
And if you wanna get money, then you're fuckin' with me
But if you're broke and can't cope, write a suicide note
'cause if you come short with my money, then your ass'll get smoked
I ain't no joke, don't provoke the pistol smoke
Takin' penitentiary chances, livin' life with dope, bitch!
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?
[Esham]
Sitting down in a weight house, countin' the bricks
Duncan-Hines, Betty Crocker, all in the mix
Sara Lee, bake me a C-A-K-E
Rollin' through your hood with my shit off safety
Boomin' narcotics, Reel Life Product
Through Hell I ball, in gasoline draws, yall
Read fed magazine with teflon bullets
Schizophrenic, Manic depressed, when I pull it
Rubber band rapper, all my knots, sittin' in spots
Duckin' from cops, still servin' when the block is hot
POP POP goes the weasel, I'm diesel
Stuntin' on these hoes, like I'm Evel Knievel
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?
This is dedicated to the niggaz who been down since day one...
A-1...
Day one...

Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?

All I do is speak the truth so don't judge me by my lies
I weigh about a buck 40 don't judge me by my size
Our glocks is like Michael J. Fox it's +Family Ties+
'cause it'll make a family cry, why
A lot of questions just ain't answered problems ain't resolved
Like if Drag really a gang member, or just involved
Y'all can be the boss of the bosses I'll be the cause of the causes
I rob from the rich and give to the less fortunate
Well I buy thousand whips and in your raps I floss this shit
I buy thousand kicks and give to the young orphanage
When I was young I was a soft kid 'till I snap
And they couln't get me off a kid 'cause he sold my mom's crack
In fact, I caught a case beyond that I couldn't face my moms
Crack addiction 'cause I was way beyond that but I face facts
I got busted over the left side of my face my face back
But I had to fix that
[Chorus: x2]
Life is short, time flies
It ain't our fault, blames aside
It ain't the licks, it ain't the eyes
It's just the way we live or die
My blood I had to taste that my wound I had to heal that
In order to feel that a real life shit and still rap 'cause
My rhymes still here so I done fried a few punks
My mom still here but she'll die in a few months
That's real life cancer and doctors ain't got the answer
I hope y'all felling this 'cause I ain't supposed to be telling y'all this shit
Like I ain't supposed to be selling y'all this shit but this is real life
Like I ain't supposed to be crying over this shit but I still mind
Shit just don't feel right but I'm gonna hold on
Till the hole in my 44 long
I'm gonna hit the gym and get my swoll on
Sometimes my head gone
And I don't give my pops props 'cause he was dead wrong
Pops was up, you know what, I don't give a fuck
The only thing I'm happy that you did was bust me out your nuts
[Chorus]

Clones..

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]

Digging in your pocket while you rubbing yo ass

Prep the H2 park it right infront of yo ass

And make you jump inside the whip and smoke a blunt wit yo ass

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

Hypnotize, stuck it in her, daze for real
That's exactly why we call this one Hazyville (Hazyville)
[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Baby, just shake ya ass till you spread on the floor
I noticed that your ass too big for your draws
You need a - a chiropractor just to marry yo ass
To tell the truth you need a tractor just to carry yo ass
Fo reala, you motherfuckers probably think that I'm playing
All bitches love to talk and all that other shit I be saying
And going hmm, see how you putting it down
I love the way you shake it throw it around!
[Chorus]

A hot chick crossed with a dirty raver
If your not this, do yourself a favor
Shake, Shake whatcha Mamma gave ya

One of the skinny flirts, spinning in their mini skirt
Sorta Similar, hear me now oi!
Take some advice from your girlfriend Lydia
No teenage games I'm past that
I need something to glance at
I told you before that my girl cant dance right
If you got moves then your good in the sack
If your looking for that, then you should be looking at this
If your looking to kiss, we can do that miss
No sleep till the sunlight creeps

And what's your angle, and how you fit in,
So this time I made up my mind,
Fuck being broke, its time to shine,
Kiss my momma, tell my daddy I'm gone,
Baby boy on his way to make a song,
From a quarter to a dollar to a five to a ten

The rise of a young black entrepreneur,
Spread my wings, I'm about to soar,
Two million, three million nigga I did it,
Two billion, three billion nigga lets get it,

[Incomprehensible]
Sometimes I just feel like, quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' wit real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Uh, da di da , it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been ripped
So I must then get, off this bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road
I'm walking these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the T.V, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from something I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressures too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' You, God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby I'm never to far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way that I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 mile road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't it still is
To be walkin' this boarder line of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you've never even seen
But it's everthing to me, it's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smelled, or met a real MC
Who's incredible on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned, having a rough time
Sit on the porch wit all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go, who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
'Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the salvation army tryin' to salvage an outfit
And it's cold tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin' I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no falling no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders I'm three in the third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road

Hey girl, watcha wanna do?
Come back to the motel room
It's cool, I ain't gonna bite
Pull those panties to the right
Hey baby, do you like it rough?
She told me to shut the fuck up
Orgasm, she had them
Then I busted out the Magnum
She got dick and bit my neck
Don't leave a mark 'cause my girlfriend trips
We could keep this on the low
And I'll call you a taxi cab in the morn
Where we at in the motel room
Gettin' ass in the motel room
Gettin' smashed in the motel room
In the motel room

Wait, can you leave your pink vibrator?
She decided to stay
Okay, we can have a three way act
Order up some champagne
Man, you know I bring the damn pain
Wait, now we getting' bubbly
They took some X and both started cuddlin'
And you know I took pictures
Introduced them to my best friend Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick
Now, let's tongue kiss, bitch
Dirt wins, game over
Day wasted out but man so what
Where we at in the motel room
Gettin' ass in the motel room
Gettin' smashed in the motel room
In the motel room
Where we at in the motel room
Gettin' ass in the motel room
Gettin' smashed in the motel room
In the motel room
On the Sunset Strip
The neon light glows on her tits
Fifty five bucks for the night
Doing cocaine till the sun rise
One, two, come to my room
Three, four, we can fuck on the floor
Suck dick at the motel six
Seven, eight, gonna check out late
One, two, come to my room
Three, four, we can fuck on the floor
Suck dick at the Motel 6
Seven eight gonna check out late
Uh, huh, put it in your mouth
Butt fuckin' on a dirty ass couch
And I don't trust the towels
There's someones hair all up in the shower
We swingin' from the chandelier
They don't care, I'm a regular here
Do not disturb Holmes
Dirt Nasty kill two birds with one bone
Where we at in the motel room
Gettin' ass in the motel room
Gettin' smashed in the motel room
In the motel room
Where we at in the motel room
Gettin' ass in the motel room
Gettin' smashed in the motel room
In the motel room

Y'all ain't foolin' with this (oh), don't even bother with that (oh)
I'm the hardest of these (oh), like my father for that (whoo)
Talkin' slick indirectly as if you really want it
That old boy don't be snappin', it just sound silly don't it
Run and shine up the coast, it's like the early twenties

Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)
[Bubba Sparxxx]
They still here, I be damned if they be losing patience
Get yo ass off my porch or else the blues await ya
No more deer, no more geese, we huntin' close minded
Some bitches want some bidness well you can sure find it
The new south is alive and well inside of Bubba
Made his soul hurt in him, don't seem to mind each other
Thank you Lord for the blessings that you bestowed upon
This old boy from down there, I bought a golden pond
See they wanted to hate it, but they learnin' to love it
Timmy check on that fire, don't let it burn in the oven
Drankin' liquor, thankin' quicker that mostly y'all imagine
After this, where's yo crib, I just might call a cabin
On the lake, next to mama, my sister Ginge and them
Have 'em sayin' Timmy's cracker, yeah we remember him
Come on Betty make it jump I make ya work it wild
Slurp it up, swallow somethin', you get a perfect smile

[Bubba Sparxxx]
But I'm here for the long haul y'all
But that just ain't a fact, naw, naw
Them old boys made her take it all off
You ain't got enough heart, naw, naw
Lose your mind, find your spirit and let your life begin
Say they just drank and smoke, well is you mice or man
We them folks takin' three when y'all was takin' one
Still I don't go to war totin' the naked gun
Please pardon me people, I'm still finding myself
Put on it's been a while, and rewind it to def
Listen closely when I babble cause I done stand the demon
In his eyes, and his smile like I was glad to leave him
[Timbaland]
Now lose your mind, lose your mind

In California [Repeat: x4]
Rollin' down Crenshaw Boulevard
Starin' at these suckers who claim to be hard
Daz Dillinger and the Gang
Who can blast and gangbang
Who gives it up for every hooker rat and hood slut
All in the cut Dat Nigga Daz with the pimp strut
You slept game on those who act lame
See ain't a damn thing changed
You know I ride the neighborhood slow
Floss on you and let the wind blow
True indeed I'm havin' a ball
Pick up the phone and give my homies a call
What's up with y'all? (What's up y'all?)
Livin' in the city where we born to ball
Rolled up a Philly we pack it tight
What a pity what a sight
And hella Chronic all damn night
Got the weed it got me kinda feelin' so high
Hennessy got a brother so feelin' so high
Pull outta state enjoy my day and I love to burn rubber
Pump up the jam for the summer
Gimme Eureka Snoop got the Hummer
Kinda make you wanna sit back and wonder
[Chorus]
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
And nigga get shot oh who they thought you was
The home of the cities of the gangsters and bud
Or you can get bad oh who they thought you was
Ooh damn back by a popular demand
Daz Dillinger back in effect homey once again
The question is why y'all got a problem with me gettin' high
Say the wrong thing get right
Prepare in effect homies are prepared everywhere
Causin' ruckus all bein' fair
Daz Dillinger finally alone in my zone
Be by myself in a place that I call home
Check it out peep out the scenery
Ya meanin' to me nuthin' to me ya keep frontin' to me
I hit you up Dogg Pound all come around
Lay 'em all down homies be frontin' for they town
Throw it up Eastside Westside bumpin'
California's the state where we be dumpin' what!
[Chorus]
Here I am stompin' down choppin' down yo compound
Knockin' all y'all out thirty seconds in the first round
Who come around get destroyed off contact
Realize and understand homey you don't want that
Check it out let's engage in military actin'
Women dope and drama keep me yackin'
Bump all that bullsh(it) you yappin'
Them beats and that bullsh you yappin'
I'm about all busy boggin' and cappin'
Pistol packin' you don't really want none of this action
Homey, you betta watch out 'cause nothin' can save ya
Tattooein' y'all with razors
Blazen that it didn't penetrate him but I grazed him
Now they callin' Daz unusual playa hater
Back on the spot feelin' high
Watchin' as the cops pass by
Smokin' fire homey I ain't lyin'
Who the man from Long Beach, California to Japan
Rockin' like wonder MC homey without a band in hand
A why can't control the whole scene
Watch it unfold get scold get blown away
Any other rapper pay dearly severely y'all come and hear me
Damn you get bruised battered & slammed
Niggas try to see who I am Dat Nigga Daz
[Chorus: x2]

Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? A joke? You smoking crack?
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground,
'For I put some wack shit out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out,
Fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
Yo slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,
This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? You got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till your car spin, you think
Damn!
You slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night
When the music stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N-W-A said fuck the police

Well, then a 'nuff gettoh youths no have no place to go
Live night and day roaming in the gettoh
Nuff gettoh youths ain't got no place of their own
Give them some place that they can call their home
Well, then a 'nuff politions telling poor people lies
And we can't get no answer when the poor people cry
The get wi ignorant, we bingi drum, we go rise
Give mi some space so I can burn those guys

Live back at 'cha Westside baby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard "All Eyez on Me," niggas know what time it is
(Makaveli the Don) 'Pac do it like that
Rhymin' and stealin', sellin' five million
(Outlaw, ninety-nine)
Fresh out on bail, niggas still can't see me
(Napoleon, E.D.I, Young Noble, Fatal Hussein)
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin' plan, and a new mission
(Makaveli the Don, Greg Nice, Outlaw, Outlaw)
Competition, so they say, these niggas is gay
(Outlaw - Outlaw)
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin' and rappin'
Heard of some niggas on the other side of town who want to ride wit me
(Throw ya hands up, hands up)
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my click
(Throw ya motherfuckin' hands up)
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality, there'll
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin mo', exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell bound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satin infiltratin, my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin' tattooed tears
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blased out sheddin' tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
Thugged out baby!
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still want to be a thug? Huh? What?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still want to be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinkin made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin' tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feudin' for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blased out sheddin' tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein' my opportunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin' this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me institutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style
Yo I been loosin' sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowin' now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin', guzzlin' beers
Beefin' and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talkin to the heavens
Walkin' through the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, startin' with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm through with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nothin' to lose, but my brain
I'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, cryin' these tattooed tears, come on
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blased out sheddin' tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

Yeah testing testing one two
Uhh one
Press the panic button god
We be the crew guess who the jayou
Are a double s I see we're
In the place to be it don't stop
We got the rhythm that makes your fingers
Snap crackle pop pop fizz fizz
We're known to give a show plus handle our bizness
Stress we'll destroy
We're known to make noise as the original b-boys
In the flesh, greater to the depth
Creates the ill scenes when we manifest, yes
I feel the vibe
I feel the vibe too
'Cause it's the butter from the crew
'Cause we original, who
Want to tussle?
Flex for the muscle?
While we kick the style that busts your blood vessels
With the rhythm
The ninety-six stylism
Pick up a pill and feel em kill em with your vocalism
Yeah, I shoot the gift puffin another cold spliff
Fools are coming quicker than anna nicole smith
Malignant metaphors and ganja stay herbs
We conjugate verbs and constipate nerds like you
I'm hear to end the conspiracy, fearlessly
So you can really see the real mc's at hand
I'm tuna fish on the stick shift
The eclectic hectic, desperate to set trip
And for the niggaz who feel, that they're 24-karat
Plus, the way you're livin' get your underwater baptism
Believe it or not, it's the rugged and raw
Put a bullet in the head of four in mount rushmore
Yeah, release the beast from within, baptize gins
Keep company with friends that repel sin
I'm out to win ain't no pretendin', fuck the first amendment
My speech was free, the day that my soul descended
Earthbound, we might sound various
Some niggaz can rhyme, but they got no character
So we preparin' you for war, don't give up the fight
You need to stand up for your rights
And grab a mic and get loose, produce the juice that keeps the head on
Collision with the new world order opposition
Competition, none, there's only one in the universe
That knows the final outcome
We got incarcerated minds, men women and enzymes
Vibin off the rhymes sent from the di-vine essence
Presence effervescence, not to be contested
Some miss the message, go ahead and bless this
So don't mistake us for a crew that used to hit
We on some underground certified wild style shit
We be the crew, guess who, and it'll be
The jayou, ninety-five a.d.
Be be causin' ramifications, physicians
Sendin' brothers on grammar vacations, if they don't listen
Competition, bustin' shots on people basin
But we can delete constipation
Jurassic, 5, mc's
And we got the cure for this rap disease
So come on everybody let's all get down
'Cause I'm down by law and I know my way around

Yo, yo, Joey, I bet you
Woe, like I get this shit in one take, yeah
When you rhyme all you do is add rock to the block
When I rhyme, I shine like Ad Rock when it drop
You go to the store and cop
'Cause it's time man, you ain't heard shit else this hot
I came prepared, not scared, can't a damn thing stop me
Next best thing in Philly since Rocky
L.A.'s first and Cali, they know where I be papi
Some cop's tryin' to flavor flav clock me
I got this, lock this in the pocket
Stick to the script, that's no main topic
Stay on the flip, creatin' my profit
And Capitol's money is capital, I'm rich off it
N.Y. diesel steam the room 'til we roll out
In D.C., 9:30 late show sold out
All said and done it's been more joy than pain
And all said and done I'd do this shit again
It's a new day of course, I can handle the fact
But still can't believe they droppin' sirens on that
So instead of talk shit, do nothin' and still listen
I'ma bang out myself, another sound mission
Evidence, got another sound mission
Yeah, started off caffeine, now it's cocaine
Speed, meth, amphetamine flow all day
The door's blocked, set up shop, closed session begins
Don't drop 'til the rhyme's locked in, here we go
Got Babu and Rakaa in my team approves
You know, ain't no stoppin' him
We like '88 Rakim, rockin them
We like 8.8, then after shockin' them
Steal the show, without a single stolen flow
I'm O.G. like Ice-T, man slow your roll
Got so many various pros
Different ones from different area codes
Right about now, I'm focused on my 3-1-oh's
And addin' three more oh's to any bill I hold
And any deal I close like just finished escrow
So now they quick to flock, 'cause they heard I got a home
But I ain't on star maps, 'cause the cat ain't really blown
But I'm, next to bat, so get ready for the storm
Can't beat 'em, join 'em that's a form of submission
So when I'm spittin', listen up, it's a sound mission
Make some noise, for one of the illest cats
On the microphone and the production boards, Evidence
Evidence, got another sound mission
World Famous Beat Junkies sound
Evidence, got another sound mission
Evidence, got another sound mission

[Hook: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Tear-able but not rippable, invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe over the world and stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it ho, here we go
Bad and Evil, so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no, joke
Goin' overboard, like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water-sprinklers, I don't love the hoes
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff his face
Back in that bitch, smother that little mothafucka 'til it suffocates
Who? You! had long enough of a wait
Why are they tryin' to be so secrective, bad and evil is reunited, hey?
Came back to annihilate the game's in dyer straight as I await
Word of Satan as I drop fall to my knees before this Ouija board
And I pray now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin' now, imagine if i awake
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mooshy, so you can't squoosh
No where near toosh, in fact if I jump out a bush
These sneak attack's the only way I say I ambush
Outlandish these words are weapons that are brandish
Standoffish, the hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law, fuck protocol, id holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Royce]
Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
Im at your homey, I'm at your home ready to spray you
While you nappin' homie have everything on and around your mattress
Lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony, you high, thug yeah
Go 'head jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waved by saying bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Tide, can't change I
I thank god for my safe thinking
Last time I was safe thinking, me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like da line
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left or right, head or gut
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave fubar
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you're not harder, body your hot bars
Beef has left you prayin' right? Like Allah hu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your metro
In a bad area that call drop
[Hook]

Oh my god! Yaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!
Oh yeahhh! Oh my god yeahh!
This is awesome! Soo awesome! (Yaaaahhhhh!)
CANNON! (CANNON!)
They know me, this yo I spit like a little kid.
Rap thinks Im a dirty hippieicky.
Harry potter, dont you try nothing tricky.
Muggles befuddled by mywizardry.
Pancake ?misery? of all any beat.
I am instinctively syncing my energy,
With the high heavens.
Secretly developing a brand new pedigree, specialty, a better me.
I essentially, must defeat what is left of methe evil me.
May you rest in pieces.
Recently deceased, I believe that world peace is,
Easily in reach if religion is decreased. Eh.
G-G-G-Gs!
I dont believe in Jesus
Does that mean that I am a DEMON?
Couldnt God and Allah have the same meaning giving someone something to believe in?
Cuz these days, between the T-Vay and what I read, I dont foresee a brand new way
Of living in the U-S of A.
Do us a Fay-vorI think we need to smoke some WAAYD!
Yes! Excuse me waiter, where are my capers?
(Forreal, I dont wanna be a pain in the ass but I wanted capers on this salad YEA BOI!)
And we act (we act)
Like they know (like they know)
But its clear (its clear)
That they dont (that they dont)
So we bitch (yeah, we bitch)
And we moan (and we moan)
And wont switch (and wont switch)
Till we voteand pick a new leader for the new year
YES WE CAN! Did you hear? Thats the new cheer.
Twenty-twelve. Did you hear? Thats the new fear.
So, oh well, roll a blunt, get a new beer.
Ash be the truthsorry yo, Im new here.
Did not introduce me.
I am so rude-arrrrrogant shoes, hell yeah they be a new pair. (good grief)
Hell, oh well, tell me who cares.
Who dares to play musical chairs with the fair-skinned Farrah Khan of hims?
I am sit-ting, sticking my Juan Dixon, writtens.
A Maryland terrapin, American lyricist with a pen, they call me a terrorist cuz I can embarrass the top ten. I guess I am Clark Kent. Ash Roth, uh, add me as a top friend.

Graveyards in my pocket.
Tombstones in my wallet.
If you talkin' 'bout my profit,
All I see is dead people.
All I see is dead people.
You starve so when my momma tryna make a couple dollars,
Any nigga with a problem, they be dyin' over dead people.
Muthafuckin' dead people.
This shit gets deep.
Don't fuck with me.
You end up six feet deep.
Listen to how I did it.
I crept up slow on Willow.
Thinkin' 'bout climbin' through the fuckin' window.
In the backseat, potato burners.
Ski mask, body bag, duct tape, and a pillow.
In the front solo.
Sittin' low with the lights out.
Feelin' like Manson on some Sonny Sam shit.
With a murder on my mind that my mind on the homicide,
And my watch said they outta time.
Somebody gotta die, bottom line.
Front page, column nine.
Headline: Another Columbine.
I plan and plot and strategized, and thought about it.
Loaded up everything in the closet.
My objective is to get bloody.
They can beg and plead, yell and scream.
Try to leave, get in cheese, pray to God on they knees, but I'm still gettin' fucking ugly.
I fuckin' love it.
Took this nigga by his throat and fuckin' cut it and thought nothin' of it.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)
Last night, I must've had a blast choppin up bodies.
Woke up bloody as fuck in the hospital lobby.
Body filled with adrenaline.
Not rememberin what I did to get all this blood on my fuckin' Timberlands.
Cop's sayin I did what to him?
Showin me pictures of cut-up bitches, disfigured members with body parts missin.
Listen, I ain't do shit, I don't know shit.
Man, I don't give a fuck about that bitch.
Fuck whatever she said, fuck whatever she saw, it wasn't me.
Oh no no, not me.
Listen to the alibi.
I was at the movies, that Avatar shit,
With them 3-D glasses on,
And that shit longer than mother fucka.
Look at my pocket, get the tickets though.
That's my alibi, bitch.
Now what up?
Fresh out the cuffs, now I'm back on the outside,
And headed west where Homicide reside.
That's my nigga.
He live on 1st and 48th right next to the white chalk in between the yellow tape,
Behind the black gate.
Rottwielers and pitbulls, surrounded by snakes, AK's and AR's.
Some niggas hard to play, some niggas play hard
But that house right there, don't go in they yard
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)
Beware of dark shit, shot 'em through the fence
Tough offensive line men couldn't stop the blitz.
Them niggas inside, a couple kittens
And this right here, good riddance.
Nigga fuck around, it's suicide for instance
Picture the mind of a bullet
Here I come I can smell the flesh aimin' for your head or neck.
Nigga, pray to God I won't hit your chest.
Now here I come straight outta drum, headed for your lungs.
You in my sight.
The last one didn't do it right,
And I'm waitin.
Just lookin at you.
Thinkin about it and gettin tired of lookin at you.
Hi, daddy, remember me?
Goodbye, daddy, this is what it gotta be.
You brought me in this world, now I'm takin you out.
Now you open up your muthafuckin mouth.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Now I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)

I'm nasty as I wanna be
I express myself so vulgarly
Obscene, or whatever you wanna call it
That's why some suckas wanna stall it
Some people worry about the wrong thing
But why worry about what we're sayin'
'Cause we're gonna do what we wanna do
And if y'all don't like it, well then fuck you too
People don't know unless you tell them so
But it was cool when we were just in the ghetto
We didn't ask you to publicize us
But it was you who created the fuss
And blew the whole thing out of proportion
You should worry about your topics like abortion
So I fiend for the funk like a dope fiend junky
Fuck you all and let us get so funky
Umph, so funky

Singin' this song, movin' along
Provin' to the suckas that I keep gettin'
Stronger than what ya been hearin'
Kid Ice is on the set, so suckas stop sweatin'
I kick it funky to show my courage
When schoolin' others, kick the knowledge
For those who hate me, I pray you'll miss me
If you find out you had dissed me
I'll treat you like a child and smack your head
Feed you dick, put you to bed
Look you in the eye and know you're fessin'
Make you take notes of the lesson
The rhythm is something I cannot hide
And I'm feelin' that I feel deep inside
So talk about me while I make my money
Kid Ice is known to be so funky
Umph, so funky

Some say I'm crazy and I got problems
An evaluation might help solve 'em
The funky mack nasty, filthy mack funky
Stankin' like [Incomprehensible], the wino junky
Mentally scarred, always barred
Slightly deranged, a half way retard
Goin' off insanely, tryin' to retain me
Tried to capture my rapture but couldn't contain me
I put 'em in shambles makin' examples
'Cause once I get started I'm hard to handle
You can't keep me back, you can't forget that
I heard the chit chat, you said that I'm wack
But anyway, that's okay
I try not to hear what the niggas say
So I just fiend for the funk like a dope fiend junky
Excuse me y'all and let me get so funky
Umph, so funky

[Intro]
I don't really know if it's dead or alive
They called for an ambulance
They said one of them won't be able to make 'til March 27
But in the mean time I'll give it a check up
[Chorus - 2X]
Hip-hop just died here's a warning
(somebody ring the alarm)
Hip=hop just died here's a warning
(somebody ring the alarm)
Hip-hop just died here's a warning
That revenge is coming (It's coming back for..)
(It's coming back for revenge)
[Chamillionaire talking over chorus]
Man I don't even know if hip-hop is dead
But I do know that some of the bigest retails stores is going out of business
Record sales ain't doing what they use to do
Remember when you use to be able to go 4, 5 million sold
Now everybody having trouble to go gold man
It's a lot of good music coming out the south
And a lot of non-sense coming out the south
But I can't blame no artist
I blame corporate america for the downfall of rap
[Chamillionaire]
If hip-hop should die before I'm great (yea)
I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape
I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape
I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape (chea)
Pollution I smell that in the breeze
But let's try not to get mad at the trees
Tell 'em all not to get mad at the leaves
Let's get mad at the idiots that planted the seeds
When it come to mixtapes, I'm know as the Messiah
I influence these other rappers to get tighter
Go to every label and murder the checkwriter
Who ever hired him, we should prey that he will get fired
And soon as they kick him out on Broadway
Show him how to make his hip-hop the hard way
I bring the whole south with me, you should just call me
And we can make a pinata out of him all day
Chea, and I ain't even finna be gentle
You can murder Seline for sending me the instrumental
It ain't coincidental how they can get in your mental
Then the minute you see it they tell you it was accidental (accidental)
All rich rappers do is complain, everybody arguing to be on top of the game
9 out of 10 rap about copping them thangs
Or how the gat go braat, braat, braat, braat when it bang
And it seems like H-town got that popular slang
Platinum grills everybody else copping the same
Platinum grills everybody else copping the same
Then everybody run to that like it's the poppinest thang
What is that man? Where the hell your swagger at?
Who gon be the first to bring the old swagger back?
Doing what I do seems like boys mad at that
You was sharp homie, where the hell is your dagger at?
I was a fan sitting up in the stands
When it was M-E-T-H-O-D MAN
You hear M-E-T-H-O-D for Cham
Rakim was still thinking of a master plan
And it worked, and now I'ma fit up in my place
Stay humble, stay focused, and show that I got grace
You better not point the burner to my face
Better load up the burner and then turn it to myspace
The same rapper than die hard, Bruce Willis with a vest under the Izod
Wanna beat you? Man I ain't got to try hard
You getting beat by the Internet and your Ipod
The label don't want you to be Master P
Took the Master and put it right after P
Bump it master, but I won't let it master me
You're an idiot if you're giving up your masters free
Corporate America is f-ing up the rap game
While we argue about which rapper got the phat chain
You real gangsta you pulling out your gat man
The real gangsta who ever own the rap name
Like Busta said "you should give a performance"
That's the truth us rappers shouldn't try and avoid it
If you're married the game go ahead and divorce it
Especially if it's rap we ain't even enjoying it
Yea I'am not going to point a "K" at a magazine
Because of what someone say in a magazine
I can..pull out my chain yellin 'Bada Bling'
Or on a G4 plane sitting by the wing
Telling you "the leather feel good don't it?"
For 50 thou you'll have a real good moment
The plane's landed by the pilot that flown it
I am not an idiot cause I'm trying to own it
Little kids look at me and say that "you best"
1.3 million in the U.S. some label exec gettting in a new desk
I get an award they tell me that I'm too blessed
Honestly it just excited my family
I just hide the medicine inside of the candy
Get cured by the music blasting out of your camry
If not I'll hide the medicine inside of your brandy
Cuz I know that yall boys gotta be drunk
To think that Chamillionaire gonna be a industry punk
I'm a in-da-streets problem you will get stomped
Get criss-cross off when the kid jump
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Jump)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Jump)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Jump)
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't
Because I'm the miggity miggity mack that stacks the plat plaques
But rap is so wack so I'm back to spit crack
March 27th I'm back and that's fact
So rappers that can't rap get ready cuz it's a wrap

Too many t-t-too many
Haters haters haters haters
Too many haters haters
Kill all the haters
[Chorus]
I had to do it to rock my shit
Had to get down to rock my shit
Ya I know the rules
And how the game exists
Don't hate 'cause I had a business
So I had to do it had to rock my shit
Had to get down had to rock my shit
Ya I know the rules
And how the game exists
'Cause gradually I have to go and count my shit
Heat my game is exquisite (when I)
Flip my slang 'cause your so flang (I don't)
Fuck around 'cause I'm a hard core miss
Mama know I got flame
'Cause I always spit shit I do
I round up the air
And I beat you with a stick
If you chop off my legs
I'm a still stand hit
I push you like a killer a killer
'Cause I'm most definIte
The road I push you to
'Cause my lyrics (hey wassap wassup)
I get my money, I get it real quick (but I)
I keep my gold 'cause it's priceless (I'm a)
I'm an undivided individual (and the)
Girl you're united an internationalist
I fornicated an elevator
But you fuck it up (huh)
I get a little reckless
So buckle up(huh)
I see a gang of holes
No time to sew it up
Don't ask me why I did it
'Cause I had it goin' up
[Chorus]
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo hoo (yo yo that's what the haters say)
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo hoo (yo yo that's what the haters say)
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo hoo (yo yo you know what all the haters do)
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo hoo(if they're gonna hate all me they're gonna hate all you)
The fuckarama
Dance to the rama
We don't wanna see you twerp
We wanna see ya all comin'
Put your eyes on my car (bling)
Your car is shit your's ain't hot (you ain't)
So stay to the right
I'll emerge to the left
Like I left you there
Shut up your on the right
To left there
If you don't wanna take it then I'll take your dare
Take you to a place where I know your scared
You ain't prepared you just paired with
Medioca up cess pit up
With medioca talents
It's unbalanced
It don't take rocket science to sell ballads
We're gonna defeat the defined
Get in a line and form more lines
You hate us 'cause we keep shouting stuff
Four minute stuff for freestyling
(Yo Dylan bring it back)
[Chorus]
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo (yo yo that's what all the haters say)
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo (yo yo that's what all the haters say)
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo (if they're gonna hate all me then they're gonna hate all you)
Heidi hoooooo hoo hoo (if you can beat me up you can be a number two)
Too many haters haters
Too many haters haters
Too many haters haters
Kill all the haters haters
Too many haters haters
Kill all the haters haters
Too many haters haters
I say to meet the haters haters
Too many
[Chorus]

(Watch your eardrums pop)
(Watch your eardums pop) (pop) (pop)
[ VERSE 1: Evidence ]
I got 61 keys with delays
I'm vocally blown, but never thrown into the maze
With no amp, I found my way out the first time round
Then - never went back without my bloodhound
I vow to hit the beat right
The crowd - light em up, so I don't see night
Mark the spot with the x, people in debt
Make promises with beats on discettes
(Yo, you feelin him yet?)
Then make some noise with your voicebox
One word, four syllables, unorthodox
Describes my style best, I attack, never rest
Cause in my sleep a metronome click beats on my chest
Till I wake, shit - automate my mix
Total control of where my highs and kicks should fit
You don't stop till executed the plot
While Bab' sets up shop to make your (eardrums pop)
(Watch your eardrums pop)
[ VERSE 2: Iriscience ]
The deejays in effect, keep holdin it down
Dilated, we're correctly holdin the crown
Plus we keep a set of keys to that golden sound
It's that shit you bump loud when you roll in the town
It's the art of showdowns, I'm quick to show clowns
I bring it like, "Sucker, where's your threshold now?"
His life under pressure in the eye of the storm
To find the root I take it to the hive of the swarm
I execute like Grandmaster Roc Raida
Congratulations, brother, you swingin a hot fader
>From L.A. I spit rocks sedated that leave craters
Some are less than, some equal, but none greater
Duck, you gunplay, I'm lovin the sunrays
Used to party Friday, Saturday, and pray on Sunday
But I figured out in life that there's more than one way
That's why I'm doin things I always knew I'd do one day
I've seen many lands and tasted the best crop
I witnessed many cultures express through hip-hop
I'm buildin with that science that De La dropped
That means it might blow up, but it won't go pop

Yeah yeah, uhh, uh-huh
Brand Nubian, yeah yeah, check it
Intro/Chorus:
You don't have to drive a fancy car
Just for you to be a shinin' star
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
Verse One: Grand Puba
Uhh, now it started it off for me in apartment 6C
Project style, ate government cheese for a while
Pop Duke wasn't there 'cause he had to do a bid
so momma love stuck with these bad ass kids
She used to say keep your head up, always think positive
and never be ashamed of who you are or where you live
Teenage years I had to struggle doing that
Shorty say "Don't talk to him, girlfriend, look where he live at
Crib probably crawlin with roaches and rats
plus cats be in his hallways with the drugs and the gats"
I used to try and honeys used to walk on by
Now I'm damn near 20 and still ain't got no ride
Caught a record deal, now them same old chicks that used to walk on by
go out their way to say hi
But they gets none
That's why I'm with the same girl from the same projects that I come from
because.......
Chorus (x2)
Verse Two: Sadat X
Well this is that time that you've waited for
Three linked from what was said to be extinct
You say take my weed-smellin ass home, I'm grown
More thirst than if I swallowed sand bags
Not fiending enough to go out and grab bags from women
I swear if we don't hear this on the air
I'll be down at the station
Your broadcast from Monday has now been switched to no day
With the class team that I'm with, we stay fit
Just like the calm before the twister hit
Brand Nubian name is gonna blister shit
We raise the flags in three places
employ black faces from midnight blacks to light tan
Brand Nubian straight rate policy for the world
For your little man, for your little girl, from Cheryl to Earl
Watch how it all go down and unfurl
Mark this print, I feel like we've all been sent
It's more than gettin money and gettin bent
(Word life, 'cause you're a shinin' star)
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
Chorus
Brand Nubian cats spread
Verse Three: Lord Jamar
A four-letter word seldom heard amongst my nation
Understandings highest elevation, the foundation
of creation of motivation, in my family there's no relation
They got us willing to be killing off our population, full-time occupation
We need to turn it around like oscillation
or watch it all burn to the ground from frustration
Lord Jamar, I'ma show love to all my people who show
To me that's how it's gotta be
Peace to Prodigy and Mobb Deep
God's working hard on the streets for the love of the peeps
Niggas bring their ass in the clubs every week
Walk right past the brothers and they can't speak
All hands meet to shake, for Pete's sake
Let's break the ice, life livin love, love livin life (Yeah)
Chorus (x2)

Freedom denied with capitalist power.

True life erased for wealth and greed.

Call it a killer's exhibition, let the body hang
A real work of art, show your heart, I blow you smart
Yeah, it's the ghetto god, rep the Bronx 'til I'm gone
Was sent to prison, you know me, homie, the chromey's itchin'
Leave you holy if you rollin' with some bad intentions
Fit the ***, then again you know that
And we don't never see him in the hood and he owe rats

Lord of war, you need a hammer, Ill sell you guns
Sell *** to Pablo, sell grammar to Pun
Stop searchin' ***, I am the one
Pepper spray gangsters, show you how the iron is slung
Now I could play like Kanye and let my chest hairs show
Put on them Kool Moe Dee glasses but that just aint Joe
Play shot and then I switch up the flow
Like what the blood glock, bumbaklaat, you ain't *** with Joe
Now mama loves me, her friends hate me
Jealous 'cause they boyfriends aint me
We gettin' that baby love, yeah, we pain free
Ain't nobody pocket certain here, we paid G's

Sit back and watch the money get bricks, muh'f***

You can keep it gangsta.
'Cause she ain't no wanksta.
Seat laid back.
And I ride with a lean.
Give me that treatment.
You know what I mean.

Sexiest thing on the block, that you seen.
Oh, oh oh oh oh.

[Verse 1]
Damn when I wanna start this rap shit without even asking, my passion,
All the way in Aspen,
So fuck that, rap that, strip that, whip that, and go
And never ever fuck with a hoe,
But Ima come back like I really understand the fucken game right,
These people tell me how I changed upon the whole fame light,
Rap when I get the flowing, strap when I get the hoes in, trap when I'm stuck in holding
Resurrect myself from the light,
Bitches talking all this shit all night,
But I dont give a fuck let me keep on rolling it up,
All the way in the back of the car,
Praying that I go far, no par,
Gotta keep fucking her right like I know I could,
Went around the world, ended up in Europe,
Dam to the place yall all really know,
Everybody start slow,
Fuck bronze, get gold, get it,
Fuck an excuse, you weren't made to be winning.
[Chorus]
Everybody wanna see me fall and it's so great,
Cause I came up and I worked so hard and everybody wanna hate,
I tell them once and I tell them twice that they don't know my fucken fate,
I look at hoes in the face and say you ain't worthy of a date.
[Verse 2]
Tats on your arm but they don't always really mean well,
Made my way to the district having sex like hell,
But why is the time so slow, bitches give head to go,
Running it out the door, that is my only flaw
Until I get back on my horse and win some more like,
I used to do back on that one High School night,
But everybody keep it moving like, Mike in 91, Bird in 92,
Can't believe I almost fell for a slut like you,
300 euros for these bitches,
Life is good if you end up with all these fucken real riches,
Man smoked the best shit in the Dam and they all still hate,
2 litres of beer damn and I'm still late,
Isn't it ironic that I made it this far,
With barely a knuckle or 2 behind any single bar,
So I still drink, still smoke, still give a fuck no,
Let myself go then I really gotta say.
[Chorus x2]

Yo, I rearrange your wholesome change
Complicate your vision and make the world look strange
Try to remain calm but yet you still feel perspiration
Drip from the top of your lip - losing concentration
Don't you try to front like we got some type affiliation
Bought yourself a piece you shit to try and avoid the confrontation
Fear me, it's in your bloodstream feel the circulation
Permenantly trife and affecting life like ammunisation
Oh shit, I've got you feeling nervous on purpose (Ha!)
I love bring that shit right at you - door to door service
Instantaneous, you will still get your shit bust (Bust)
Only spontaneous, all that shit talk is miscellaneous
You be rolling shady we gonn' establish all the shadyist
Yet all of my black peoples be the most craziest
Numerals of funerals every day
When I take a closer look of all my niggas around my way (Ha!)
Ha, yeah, I love to dig from deep within
Making your head spin
Hot Fudge coming on in good lord
Hot Fudge coming on in good lord
Hot Fudge coming on in good lord

Aeiyo, you look like my man, y'all look similiar
Alibis that niggas trying use like we familiar
Fuck that! You really need to check your criteria
Violating the world, annihilate your whole area
Been in this too long to allow niggas to try to take mine
23 years deep and I still exist as BUSTA RHYMES!
Aeiyo, I'm in this to win this, gets down to handle my buisiness
While I be Busta Rhymes you still be whoever your name is
In my past life the world felt my mega blast
Now in my present life I'ma still bust your fucking ass
Yo, it's been predicted, ever since I was a child
Getting addicted to candy bars I was still wicked
Drop jewels on many fools while my niggas pack tools
In '89 when we signed this Leaders Of The New School
Four, lyrical Schwarzeneggers rolling like commanders
Wrecking shit, hit after hit, while we set the standards
Back then came leaders of the 'New it was like a dream come true
You could scream on the mic and do what you gotta do
In the meantime I show improved and stick my lagoon theory
Scream at the top of my lungs until you fuckers hear me
Yo, I love to dig from deep within
Making your head spin
Hot Fudge coming on in good lord
Hot Fudge coming on in good lord
Hot Fudge coming on in good lord
Hot Fudge coming

Who said enough was ever enough?
Will we let them make the rules for us?
And you know we shine like the sun
So put it in drive cause we're on the run
So let's break all the rules
I want you to hold me down like you love it
Kissing and touching all in public

These fools, they froze, but this g's lonely here
And gotta be working for... oh, whatever

The life binary in Morse code
Ain't really a life, right?
It hurt though, it feel like a voodoo curse
So you scream every so often to break up the monotony
You feel me? No, fuck your feeling
A real motherfucker here is tryna fuck for real
Like something's here but fuck it though
He ain't gon' feel for a while, he ain't been real for a while
So it gon' kill you to smile? So it gon' kill you to die?
Or do you just stop?
Shit maybe, you don't even know that shit crazy
Be OG and go, and get away
See, you already know they can't hate if they don't ever wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Please wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
I'm so tired of bein' alone, I'm so tired of goin' home
Won't you help me, won't you help me?
This ain't healthy to be held to blame
Once you help me, now you abandon me
What you're tellin' me by not tellin' me?
Anything, anything
I'd give anything if you'd say my name
Don't you play with me, it's an emergency
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass

She'll dance in your lap till you're ready to pop

On the late night till daylight the club jumpin'
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want
Baby, this a new age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
The smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice, baby

In her fantasy, there's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soakin'
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll

Now that that shit should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride, break it down

Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

"Let me show you somethin'"
"Let me show you somethin'"
Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East
With priests I'm from the Church of the Operating Room
With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust
I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse
Holding up office lights standing at huge heights
Back and forth left wing swing to North
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap
Look at the land... Blue Flowers!
Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers!
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers!
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow
Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you
Holding bags on down right from the hospital
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves
I see the mascot of Evil he's not Knievel
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... Blue Flowers!
It's raining green, by the pond Blue Flowers!
It's totally raining green, pouring Blue Flowers!
I smell the bees and the birds Blue Flowers!
Different aspects of life, blue flowers

Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this lama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I see ya mama through it

Throwin' blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin' to get stocked
Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block
It's like the rap games far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lane, how come? They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin' to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin' VSOP tearin' my liver
Livin' my life like I don't care I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin' I'ma make it home
The streets is funny peeps'll kill you
Over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin'
And don't keep it gully, I'm from the Bronx
Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin' that you comprehend this
Its the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
Its the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on strangers
Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up like "Yo, why me?"
I never really had a pops
But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the streets my name
And heat's my game, 'cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the cast, you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap at you though
You for real here, niggas be followin' with steps
I made my own moves, so the tokers, could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you once considered a friend
Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin' to scare society
But can't slip again 'cause my lil' man relyin' me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin' to climb hills
And tryin' to make me kill for less
Yo its the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo its the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up
Like yo, why me?
Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work
I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chaser
It ain't safe here, the bright lights cablide you
Mix sedica, swallow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin' these streets
I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin' they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin' to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin' for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin' from nothin'
Comin' from nothin', makes you struggle harder for somethin'
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin'
The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, don't make me have to spray ya
Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work

Goofy flow on records I'm Captain Hook
And my new car is Rufio
Damn where my roof just go
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for, like
Leavin' girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl, I got 'em
They can't help it,
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
But bitch I got money to blow

Binnin' out we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini's and the Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds

Tell me you don't sleep at night, I know
Because of how things have been
Tell me how you just don't trust your life to someone
Don't trust that love can win
Just as sure as God lives in my heart I'll say
Take heart, it won't say this way
If there's one thing you can count on
If there's one thing you can know for sure
If there's one thing you can count on
Things are gonna change
If there's one thing you can count on
Things are gonna change
I'm sure it's hard to be where you are now
Won't say I've been there before
But I'll be at your side in silence
Words are wasted before a broken heart
Where I've failed in the past to be there for you
You'll find this truth comin' through
If there's one thing you can count on
If there's one thing you can know for sure
If there's one thing you can count on
Things are gonna change, oh yeah
If there's one thing you can count on
Things are gonna change
Oh, don't give up,
Well, I've seen some hard things
I never thought that I would ever smile again
Holdin' on when I feel half-hearted
I keep my faith without a way to explain it
'Cause I believe it won't always be like this everyday
Hold on, and trust what I say
If there's one thing
If there's one thing
If there's one thing God has promised
Things are gonna change, oh yeah
If there's one thing you can count on
Things are gonna change
Things are gonna change
Ha!
Gotta have a little faith
Maybe add a little trust
Add a lot o' love
You see your gonna rise above the things that are so rough
'Cause we have a hope
And we'll be all

Take me as I em my friends, ain't gon' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know
I was in seventh grade when I heard the Slim Shady LP,
Ya my mom brought it down when I was ironing, irony,
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school,
Sink my teeth in anything just to think I'm cool, riding the bus,
I feel the rush but I still don't give a fuck,
Ya I wish I could agree but I've already had enough,
I've already given up from playing the same game,
Every interview I feel like I'm saying the same thing, like,
Em was great, yea he paved the way for me,
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z,
But they keep relating me, I cant get away,
Chasing me, (all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And now the masters thinks that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers,
They say "Ashers not a rapper, na hes actually just a actor",
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection,
Its easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection,
Every minute, each hour of everyday,
Im constantly on the fence defending my own name,
Explaining we are not the same,
Not much that I can say, except that im sick of it,
Critics arrogantly sparked up a flame, its on
[Chorus: x2]
Take me as I em my friends, ain't goin' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know
Now don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited,
Its like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I've been spitting,
Its so different, the image they don't get it,
Its simple I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living,
But Em was in it way before I committed ,
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it,
But each critics been picking apart my writings,
And if its not up to par then Ashers par is just a gimmick,
Is it my fault must I be more convincing?,
Y'all talk all you want, never halt me from my mission,
Using his ammunition, would you please keep dissing me,
(all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And yea the haters wanna hate because I made it and I'm famous,
But until you take my place,
Y'all never know what it takes to make a record for respect,
Take a second before you inspect,
When you look like someone else then what the fuck do you expect,
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game,
But its harder for an artist creating his own lane,
That's anonymous with his rhyming and combine with perfect timing,
All the time all that's declining and about to explode
[Chorus: x2]
So fuck it that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say,
If I don't confront the problem it will never go away,
Unless it is addressed there is nothing left for me to do,
Its impossible rejecting an elephant in the room,
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions preconceived
Sworn to all the wrongs, could of swore they knew me,
If you have no further questions and cant think of other thoughts,
Then let me introduce you to Asher Paul Roth.
[Chorus: x2]

Cash money shit, cash money shit

We've been talking for so long

You've been waiting for me, oh ho

Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

What I gotta do let y'all niggaz know?

Hardcore? Commercial?
Whatchu wanna do, you wanna wile up, you wanna dance?
Don't matter to me, I got it all locked down baby
It's not a game it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall, when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin
Unless you got my ends, I'ma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost thenbam bamsay hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, murder, respect, beer, honies and sex want here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggaz I keep, I put em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
You fuckin with reel to reel, rap axe maniac
Sound bwoy killer, hack hack chain-react
Two for one - double the death, same price
What would Big say? "Huh, you know that ain't right"
It's not a game pah sample
We're gettin paid hah sample
It's still T. Squad sample
"What you came for? Surgery, with the chainsaw!"
Watch what happens to your friend
You don't want this to happen to you
You give me the money, okay?
Word to 'Pac and Big, my glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Ain't no bullshittin, gettin the full treatment
Special two heated missles, 'til your crew's leavin witchu
I rip you in half - blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little (HA HA) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talkin loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew? Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fittin to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Grip you like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy, probably robbin your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North, stashin knives up my ass
Survivin the task, we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips, fast as fast'll spit
Add some tips for any, bastard bitch, pappin shit
Watch me rep til the death from the bassonet, beotch

These cats is no match, plus they lack a certain knack for rapping
They never catch the wagon like Re-run and "What's Happening"
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa
We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain
We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much
We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much
God bless you

I be the first ever Asian astronaut
Blastin' off, castin' off
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar
Rode a mastodon out Jurassic Park
Chased by a fan in a Tyrannosaur mask
Travel the traffic cop
Past the spot
Where the ostrich got across for the ocelot
What I couldn't of bought
'cause they wouldn't a popped y'all
Just for me to cop it one
So I had to be up
I'm going gradually up
Into the galaxy bus
Until I can't feel my lungs
I pass the family up
I see an enemy's bus
Saw the anatomy up
I catch the ballerinas
Now I was walkin' down this one block
Didn't hear a gun shot
Smellin' hell or nature
Pickin' fruit off of a kumquat
Tree another day up in this life under the sunspot
Light upon my innervision searchin' for an answer
Heredetory, man-in-glory, days of the missile fury inventory took
And while I raise
Rain began to fall from the verbal dance I did amaze all the natives
And the ladies said "You're crazy - would you love to have my baby?"
And I plays with the chief of the Mohicans and the Sheikh
And travelled everywhere from Delaware way up to Mozambique
Was givin' praise with the Deacon at the steeple
Spirit-seekin'on the weekend with a tea can and a pair of old shades
It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
And shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes it's a mutual thing
'cause it's the root of all things, and we aims to be
The venomist, instrumentalist, syllabal-mystic man traveller
Skippin' through the brakes on a Wednesday into a city plaza
Tryin' to make it 20 out of 15 pennies on the after
The cold-hearted world creepin' on my destiny like salamanders
Enchanters, 'cause I run their goose and I be the gander
Cleanin' out the digestive tract of hip-hop like cranberries
Shinin' like amber
All of the children told me "Damn you're an
Answer to our ears and deadly threat that's posed by cancer"
On Prancer, on Comet, on Cupid, I'm Santa
Got more flow than Flo Jo, while I laugh Ho Ho Ho, got jo jo dancer
Punchlines, I'm a Crunchtime Casper, and a one-time champion for it
A hundred lifetimes in the hereafter, and for the reincarnation transform
What the heck I'll come back for it
Gotta handle chores now, and discuss all of that with God afterwards
We goin' bobsled off the Himalayas
With the bottle of bobs ?
In a big ol' box full of the latest compilations
And then we won't stop til we hit the Appalachians
To the Bulletts Bargain Basement
Then 'cross the Baltic ocean basin
The ride 'cross that Oakland night bridge
A drop deposit in the drop embankment
Makin' cakes that taste like Tecrine
Bakin' ex-potatoes, raisins, plaintains, M&M;'s, peanuts, grape juice
I'm savin' my pay checks to get my plane fixed why's that
We goin' fly all night - stop the propellors and
Jump out of the side with umberellas and
Let's make them all night the caterpillars that
Take us to the top the Himalayas
It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
And shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes it's a mutual thing
'cause it's the root of all things, and we aims
A lot of people follow ? and tolerate indeed
About to lead 'em all to battle upon the bottom of the beat
And plant a seed of thought that sproutin'
Like a balance like a teeter-totter
Seen a lot of freedom ? the feat amount to beat the drama
He began to dis
Until the nurse, the passengers had grabbed his shirts
And nothin' happened assured the captain and the person
But the pressure had expanded, and inertia burst, the cabin burst
And all 'em burgers, blankets, rations, animals and drinks
They flew out
Fleeds a lots of man ?
Climb upon the wall like Peter Parker
Meeter of the creed of darker regions
Darker seasons
These are not the reasons for the grief
And now proceed to outer-reaches
How to keep styles from seepin' outta me
They flew out
The fusilage
Had blew in time
It stupid to have
The attitude
When you would dive
Into the ground
(Now) if you'd have thought
Of suicide
If you would try
But you would tie
A parachute
Onto a slide
And took a dive
Now who's alive?
It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
And shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes it's a mutual thing
'cause it's the root of all things, and we end

2 Chainz!
I keep my hoes in check, you buy Nike for yours
Say they want that loud, I'mma bring that noise
Check my watch on a flight
Yeah, I call that airtime
Murk 'em in the middle of the street
That gon' be his deadline
Yeah, you gon' respect mine, got a body on my Tec-9
Say you nobody 'till somebody gon' body you, flatline
Pocket full of dead guys and you know I'm anti
Anti-social, anti-lame
But ain't I cool nigga, ain't I?
You looking at a star that's spaced out
They try to take my style and then take off
I go to work with no days off
Everything I own paid off
Shawty pussy hair shaved off
And she did it just for me, nigga
Would skip you like a spacebar
But I much rather delete niggas
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
I've been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?
Gucci hat (Gucci hat), Gucci belt
If you wrote a autobiography
You'd have to sue yourself
Your lying ass, codeine in my wine glass
I know you had a wild past
I ain't fucked you in a while with your wild ass
I get high and I fly past
I don't know nothing 'bout iChat
I work in this iPhone they need an app called iTrap
I trap, shining like a night lamp
I just hit my girlfriend and asked her where her wife at
White cup, white hat, laying on a white couch
Got that presidential and a residential white house
Nigga saying "who?" (who) like a white owl
You can see me shinin' (shinin') with the light out
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?

Bought a new crib just to fuck you in

Turn five to a ten to a twenty to fifty to hundred
My niggas get money, I want it (BEEP)
Ride through the city my niggas got choppers
My bitch she's so pretty that's my pocahontas
Everything on me I shine like a trophy
Run up a check while they watch out for police
Versace my pinky, a brick on my Rollie
The Cali Ferrari I'm feeling like Kobe
TRU that's to the death of me, nigga
Killers on the right and left of me, nigga
My destiny nigga to get all this money
I can't share that whole recipe with you, nigga
My nigga told me "get 'em" did it I got 'em
Stand on that couch, drink out of the bottle
That .40 got hollows, that bitch she gon' swallow
Get to that money, I'm king of Chicago
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought the Benz just to fuck your friends
Giuseppe's 900 with that gold boss
Everything 'bout me raw like a dope charge
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in

Baby
Ooo baby
Baby,baby
Ooo um baby
Oh baby
We need to um talk about where
We're taking this thing.
How far we're gonna let this go.
We've been here before.
Its getting late.
It's getting late.
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me.
Watching, needing, wanting me.
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice.
Baby, oh baby baby baby
Listen, I've already been thinking about you on my mind.
Far too often for you,
To be here at this time
You see, one hands on nine and the other's on my thigh.
Look,I already played with the idea of you
Being here in the morning
And the position for the crack of dawn
And the conversation before the yawning
But aah, it's getting late.
It's getting late.
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me.
Watching, needing, wanting me.
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be.
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be.
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice.
Oh Baby baby baby
How's about I let you touch the space.
That you left behind,
The day that you stop smiling
The day that the tears started falling
But now were talking, touching
Almost making sensual again
We can taste the familiar,
'Cause, the family hour supports it.
Of this moment,but was led by the movements cause ah
It's getting late.
It's getting late.
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me.
Watching, needing, wanting me.
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be.
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be.
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice.
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby twice baby baby.
I see the memories we replayed
Same space face bodies
I know there's a method to your manliness
But ah I'm a afraid
It's getting late.
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me.
Watching, needing, wanting me.
But I'm afraid, you say don't be.
But I'm afraid, and you say don't be.
I'm afraid that you'll gonna hurt me baby, baby twice baby
I see the memories replayed, same space, same place
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, babe
I see the memories replayed, same space, same place
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, baby

Holler out your city if you ride for it
Let em know why you die for it
Same reason all these riders get high so it's
All medicinal now what you wanna buy, homie?
Bye bitch
Mob shit
Boss talk
Game rich
Name game
Gang signs
Work on the phone call it base line
(Yup)
Line dance like a ho down
Pimps up daytime
Whole block a ghost town
Ghost ride, ghost face
G's get ghost in a moment
Pour a little for the ghosts of the dead homies
Deadpan voice singing tin pan alley songs
Panhandling in front of tourists with the camera phones
Get it how you live
Or live till you get it
Get it in
When the stash low and it's no cash
Get it in
And you ridin' no L's no tags
Get it in
And she lookin' like you ain't gon' smash
Get it in
But she got her legs up on the dash
Show these haters how to go
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
(Cocc Pistol)I get it
I whip it, I flip it, I pocket the profit
Don't know when to stop it
They callin' me Griselda the harlot
My ? is erotic
Can't walk the hill is enormous
The arm in the armrest
(Click clack) these dames is dormant
I came up from boosting my garments
Switching my handbags
How I switching my polish
Never catch me in the same blouse
Unless I'm running to Target
Never catch me in a large crowd
Unless I'm the life of the party
I been hitting from September to August
Ahead of my time like lil' old ladies and bonnets
All I need is a sickle imma reap me a harvest
The hardest thing I had to do was to make a real promise
I been countin' money since elementary
That's why these broke boys ain't gettin' into me
And when the stash low
And it ain't no cash flow
Shit I go to work
Move it by the boat load
When the stash low and it's no cash
Get it in
And you ridin' no L's no tags
Get it in
And she lookin' like you ain't gon' smash
Get it in
But she got her legs up on the dash
Show these haters how to go
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Stop
Red lights in the distance
You never been to that district they reference
Trunk full of hashish and mescaline
Your mind is a mess and this bitch is undressin'
A) mash on the throttle like a G
Put a bottle to your teeth
Say fuck it, you're a free man
B) pull over to the side of the street
Keep your hand on the shotty sitting up under the seat or
C) let the cop pull you over say something slick
On some Jay-Z 99 Problems type shit
D) all of the above in your head but
It really doesn't matter cause you already dead
No obituaries for the most part
Nobody cares you're not even a co-star
Just an extra
They read about it as a number
Names got money in their wallet
When the stash low and it's no cash
Get it in
And you ridin' no L's no tags
Get it in
And she lookin' like you ain't gon' smash
Get it in
But she got her legs up on the dash
Show these haters how to go
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work
Get that work
Make that work work

[feat. Tegan Quinn]
I know, leaving's your living, built in your bones
No one can ever escape all of their ghosts
So if you walk, you better learn how to run
That's why I wrote this song
Your contrail's coated in broken homes
You polished up this pretty pearl of a hope
That I won't parade your skeletons for everyone
But that's why I wrote this song
That's why I wrote this song
That's why I wrote this song
That's why I wrote this song
I know you know the words, so sing along
She always made the best of deaf and blind
Fashionable dress of canes and signs
Tracing their apparel, like a judge of character in Braille
She never missed a lift, a bump, or line
But fingertips will drift and miss blip from time to time
And this is how we find
Secrets that slipped our grip
Over wit and charm on whispered breath
Frantically fishing for familiarness on fingertips
And this is just, shit, what is this?
This is redress
I know her cane is just a comedy
Tin cup's a crutch for crippled honesty
Her slain perception's lame deception
What's astonishing, we bought it, see
Every Harry, Dick, and Tom, left her very fickle palms
Palming a broken promise ring, you follow me?
A hundred strong men choked on the bit
While the blind bride guides the bridle toward the abyss
And this can only end wrong
But motherfuck it, that's the reason why I wrote this song
I know, leaving's your living, built in your bones
No one can ever escape all of their ghosts
So if you walk, you better learn how to run
That's why I wrote this song
Your contrail's coated in broken homes
You polished up this pretty pearl of a hope
That I won't parade your skeletons for everyone
But that's why I wrote this song
Lionel Terray said it the truest, I set it to music
We're all "Conquistadors of the Useless"
What kind of fool is so stupid to climb a mountain do it
Then climb back down to the town without a picture to prove it?
I knew it
From the moment I saw your eyes flash wide in the crowd
That you would cut and run, but it's too late to turn back now
It's when those burnt black clouds submerge the Earth in shroud
That kings earn that crown
And this is how we rise by taking the fall
Survive another winter on straight to the thaw
One day you'll learn to strain the tea through your teeth
And maybe find the strength to proceed to the peak
Press on into the thin again till I cannot breathe
I swallowed so much of my damn pride that it chokes me
The real risk is not a slipped grip at the edge of the peak
The real danger is to linger at the base of the thing
I know, leaving's your living, built in your bones
No one can ever escape all of their ghosts
So if you walk, you better learn how to run
That's why I wrote this song
Your contrail's coated in broken homes
You polished up this pretty pearl of a hope
That I won't parade your skeletons for everyone
But that's why I wrote this song
That's why I wrote this song
That's why I wrote this song
That's why I wrote this song
I know you know the words, so sing along

Uh, check it, check it
Aiyo, it's very rare that you see me an Lanson
In a club, with bub, partyin', we dancin'
If so, it's Chris, Bacardi, an some Branson
All leathered out in a Harley or a Vanson
Now I ain't dissin' chicks
But I ain't trickin' shit
That's un yo, wit me you get fish an chips
That's right exotic and we live it
But just cause I got it
Don't mean you can get it
Now I take them black, nasty, red bone, beautiful
Just brush your teeth for me, that's suitable
Don't care about your toes or your cuticles
First we lie then work them thighs
It's a one night stand, not to hurt your pride
But ma, I'm a dog, it ain't worth the lies
And tell your man chill
He don't deserve to die
Plus the nigga probably ain't circumcised
[Chorus]
Oh every beat we make, we make hot
And every watch we got, got rocks
And every car we got, we got dropped
And every clock we got, we keep cocked
To all the charts you on, we on top
And every house you own, we just copped
And all the bank you got, we got stock
And every chick you wit, we just hit
Check it out
Yo, I'm the same cat that you see in all places
Got a mil in hundreds and it's all small faces
Old school money, uh huh, we got access
What you get a year, we spend that on taxes
We don't talk to niggas, we just wait for faxes
End up wit the cash, you bent up in the trash
Leave you wet, we set, in a net, in the dash
Nigga like me been a vet since the past
Who out here don't feel I'm lockin' it yet
Video time, no props on the set
If you see a car that's my drop on the set
If you see jewels that's the rocks on my neck
And if a club scene really pop to be wet
We just bought a chopper, you coppin' Bigets
If you feel different, I'm stoppin' the bet
You rockin' a vet while we hop on a jet
[Chorus]
Hey pretty mama come wit me
If you think your a nasty girl
Your man had you livin' in a fantasy
But it's really Cam'Ron's world
Meet me at the door about a quarter to four
And bring four more girls (bring 'em all)
My mans outside in the parking lot
With the six chromed out in pearl
And yo, you know my style when we creepin' too
Yo, who that boo, your man beepin' you
Well say your wit Lexis, with the Lexus
God damn yo, I just missed the exit
I''m kinda tipsy, I don't want to wreck shit
And don't think ma, that I'm on some next shit
Just wanna know if we can get breakfast
Then go to the telly for some sex shit
[Chorus: x2]

[Chorus]
I want to be your chick
I want to be down for you
(Do ya trust me?) Yeah
(Love me?) Yeah

A your youth you know, wew
For the master has come back, gong the originally
Run for the grand finale, mi inna mi Clarky-Wally
For the master has come man, man, I do it regularly
Through every hill and valley, it's normal for me now
For the Master has come back, It's Mr. Warm and easy
She could never leave me, somebody please believe me
For the master has come back, I'm mad wid it
Boom, we learn from the old school
When strictly thugs used to run it
When one wheel really was the move
Long before Bogle start dance
And still pon deh paper money
Police alock up man fi them shoes
That simply mean the station full up
A bare Clark boot and bally
From England whe' spankin' new
Before man start to mek flex
When then used to mek dally
And speak of the rights and truths
If unno starvin' fi di brain food
Man have it fi feed you like porridge
Weh rich inna dreadnut juice
'Cause nuff a wah dem learn in university and college
It water down and dilute,
I tell you street smarts wi carry you through life like a cartridge
From a survival point of view and if what you seek is the truth
And to increase knowledge, now you surely can't lose, why?
For the master has come back, Gong the originally
Run for the grand finale, mi inna mi Clarky-Wally
For the master has come man, man, I do it regularly
Through every hill and valley, it's normal for me now
For the Master has come back, it's Mr. Warm and easy
She could never leave me, somebody please believe me
For the master has come back, I'm mad wid it
The return of the dread I when I get back
The entire empire will start to strike back
Well, a bare army green full up mi flight park
Some red eye guy wonder which bank we hijack
And a we the voluptuous girls a smile at
Any bwoy nuh like dat, him gone pon ice box
We can be dangerous like how the night black
We will dip and come up
Select and slide back and seh she loves my culture
Herbs and my locks, silky smooth way I flow
My words and my tracks
She's hoping we can spend a night at
Somewhere that's warm and cozy, why not?
She's been wanting me since my Karl Kani drop
And she needs the substance, not the hype chat
For dark clouds do bring rain, baby
Here comes the sun to shine again
For the master has come back, Gong the originally
Run for the grand finale, mi inna mi Clarky-Wally
For the master has come man, man, I do it regularly
Through every hill and valley, it's normal for me now
For the Master has come back, it's Mr. Warm and easy
She could never leave me, eve if you don't believe me
For the master has come back, I'm mad wid it
Boom! I know you're loving the goods that I'm delivering
Up in your neck of the woods so you can live again
Who is the cock in the coup which part the chicken in
And dem a copy the books that I have written in
And when you hear from the shout, dem no have no discipline
And dem a run up dem mouth, them never listening
And when the Gong no deh bout, I know you're missing him
'Cause lyrically no doubt I'm Nitroglycerin
Mi touch down it's carousels of luggages, my flip phone
My car cell, my messages, my girl bring me parcels and packages
Marijuana cigar smells in palaces,
A few coil must pop off for di charities
'Cause politition a palave' pon dem promises
A new face will fulfill the prophecies,
It's too late for two faced apologies
For the master has come back, Gong the originally
Run for the grand finale, mi inna mi Clarky-Wally
For the master has come man, man, I do it regulary
Through every hill and valley, it's normal for me now
For the Master has come back, it's Mr. Warm and easy
She could never leave me, somebody please believe me
For the master has come back, I'm mad wid it
When fire tun down low we're only simmering
Anyhow we start get cold, dem would be shivering
Not everything is gold because of glittering
Tell dem fi clean dem soul from all di littering
And they don't own di throne dat they be sitting in
And it was just a loan they're only sitting in
And when the king come home well what a bitter thing
Nashing of teeth and moaning upon bickering
Well, mind you catch the flow it can be sickening
Only a few are chosen for the reckoning
It's Rastarfari's that unno living in
And it's a lion's jungly unno visiting
I know you've seen the posters of my images
Upon your streets and close to all your villages
My metaphors unfolding with my similes
Woman can go dance again, boom
For the master has come back
For the master has come back
For the master has come back
For the master has come back

We built this city
We built this city
We built this city
We built this city on rock
We built this city (on these blocks we hustle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)
[Jimmy Jones]
Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
[Juelz Santana]
Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know, the usual
Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
[Hell Rell]
It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
My enemies can't rest in peace Jones, you see they funerals up
New gangstas in the city bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scam
If not, back to the block, ship some grams
[Cam'Ron]
If not, get with Cam
I got clips to lift a van, flip a van
Shit, they can kick the can
This cat think he sling
Cause he got a pinky ring
Rinky-dink diamonds, they don't even make your pinky bling
(We built this city) And now I'm about to kill this city
(We built this city) Cradle to 50, yeah I'm acting real seditty
(We built this city) Cause I collect mils and fifties
For real it's pretty and y'all gonna feel the pity
(We built this city on rock) Dipset Bitch
[Chorus: repeat 8X]

Yeahh
Yeahh
Yeahh
Look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat dragged
Cream of the crop shit
I got chicks all schemin' to hop giggs
They feelin ma hot shit
BP wanna' lean in ma cockpit (YESS)
Feelin ma chopstick
Diabetes, feelin the chocolate (UMMM)
Beatin it off shit
Have a three-some, peas in a pod shit (AHH)
I'm a bait artist
I done it bare back I take chances
Straight naasty I ain't glaancin
I'm a breast man but I rate arses
Late parties, but I aint daancin
courvoisier ant fillin up eight glaases
Vip shit, eight paases
Suttin freaky for me to take part in
[Chorus]
Look at the swag dats himm
Hollowman who gets the mad stacks in
Look at his, Kicks and the hats matchinn (that's RIGHT)
Look what the cat dragged in
This ain't your average bling
Look at him

Look what the cat dragged (CAT DRAGGED)
Push up your black flag (BLACK FLAG)
Buck came round
Fest juss rang, Nuts came down
Ma little slut playground
I was guilty but I'ma boss case now
I wannt a touch base now

Look round at Nuts face smile

Told the mandemm to not argue
Nuts toilet, Buck bathroom

Fest stil ringin sayin he might pass through

Cos hollowmans packagin' the right parcel
That Slim Shady like Marshall
His friends still comin' with a nice car full
[Chorus]
Look at the swag dats himm
Hollowman who gets the mad stacks in
Look at his, Kicks and the hats matchinn (that's RIGHT)
Look what the cat dragged in

Look what the cat dragged (CAT DRAGGED)
Push up your black flag (BLACK FLAG)

As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I`m dead up serious so don`t be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always want to know what makes me tick
I`ll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I`m dipped and I`m slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I`ll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC`s are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today
And if they`re ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb
But what the hell`s success if the mess ain`t changing
50`s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin`
Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`
While the dealers still sellin` so I`ll refrain from the yellin`
And the preachin` 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don`t want to stop that, they want to live fat
Who`d want to clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they`re all wrapped up in it
It`s an unfortunate state for many it`s too late
Now death stalks the streets and it`s right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain`t goin` insane
I`ll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain`t no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Life`s a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain`t the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn`t too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl`s a ho
But I don`t listen to shit unless the story`s legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I`ll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I`m hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you`ll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain`t no shame in my game

Keith e.e. emcee on a spree I'm goin for this
Cause draws applause, yes I adore this
I'll reteach with speech, I can accomplish
I've got to flaunt this, I'm not a pessimist
Yo I'm an optimist, that's why I'm droppin this
I'm good I got style, cause I've stood for a while
In the shadows of the others gettin mellow with the brothers
Called the gang, and yes I can hang
Progressin with my lesson while I do my thang
I've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
(repeat 2x)
You say your rhymes flow, I say I'm spontaneous
Rockin the place, I'm not mainly just
Sayin some words that are weak or incoherent
And it's apparent, that you fear us, the gang
But I'm still a peace seeker
I'm in your face, don't have to sneak ya
Dope rhymes speaking with wisdom of a preacher
And I'm here, cause you've been victimized
I'm sincere, I see through gifted eyes
So yo, we're gonna see what the race is
That's where you groups, will have to face us
And you can bet we'll be in tip-top shape
Nice so precise with a hip-hop update
Wait, I got a shoutout for the ladies
Come check me baby, don't underrate me
Cause I'm a man with the plan for all
The guru, to groove you, get out the wall
I've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
(repeat 2x)
I've got gusto, so I'm kickin it well
I got gusto, with much clientele
So I pump it, to a higher decibel
Have a seat, listen cause the rest it goes smooth
And improve and bust a move
I am the man with the true blue potential
I am essential, I drive you mental and back
Attack mack and rap
And as you calm I will romp
Like a giant I stomp
I've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
(repeat 2x)
Really? right, you wanna be a emcee?
Then go against me -- boy don't even tempt me
Cause I go house on the freestyle tip
Math you and blast you and then just shift
Into hype gear, no fear, I persevere
Year after year, rehearsin verse so clear
Cause I've been into rhymin man for like eons
And every stage, word I wanna be on
So I can show you how it's gotta be done
I never run or shun, I've just begun
I've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
(repeat 2x)
..
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
(repeat 2x)
Ahhh yeah... gusto...

Who'll walk up to this police car
Open the door and let me out (hit man)
Me and my family got the most game
Just to get close to me, brothers come around
And repeat my slang

Everytime i say wassup

Brothers come around, givin' us pounds

Man, you could be black with a acc.

If he pull the gat on you first
Give him everything but your dreams
Atlanta bound, homebase, 2 over
We give chase back to the beats
Passin' by the police in the streets
Georgia on my mind
All the peaches to nibble on
Back on the grind when all your figures gone
Check this out, run with the gat, ya put the clip in it
Ah ah, then you check money for the slip in it
The world is on fire, sin is murder for hire
Whatever evil shit you desire
Easy a chameleon, forever changin'
Over colors, no more bangin'
You want to keep dead bodies from danglin' on the hit man
Three brothers like backbone...

Down here it get hot, see i'm born and bred

[Reverend Run]
Now I said, now here this
Thus sayesth the Lord God
And I believe, a lot of us
Shouldn't even condemn these rappers
Because if nobody would ah told me about God
People would ah been
The church folks would ah been
Talkin bad about me
I believe we gon' have people like
Rev. Snoop Doggy Dogg up here soon
We gon' have Rev. 2Pac
These brothaz need your encouragement
They do not need you to pull them down
I don't believe in bashin these people
That are out there on the street
I believe in encouraging them
I believe in bringin'em in
Because if nobody would ah helped me
I'd been messed up
Do unto others as you would want done to you
If you see ya brothaz and sista out there
On the street
And you know they back slittin
Don't just go tell sista so-and-so
You heard what happened on that child
Go and get her
Bring her in, and this is the reason you seen her
'cause God wants you to go and get her
God wants you to love your brothaz and sistaz
Dis is not a game of hurtin each other
It's a game of helpin each other
You got to help one another
You got to love one another
You got to respect on another
We have such a crab mentality these days
You see somebody comin to the top ah the brow
You wanna pull'em down
But I believe we should help on another
I'm tellin ya right now, saints
I've given you my heart today
I'm lettin you know all the secret things that happened to me
It's not easy for to come out here and talk about
The things that happened in the past
But I want you to know somethin
That God has completely turned my life around
Let everyone stand
Give the Lord a hand clap
Praise the Lord

[Jeff Jockwell]
Jeff Jockwell and you're tuning into WBRK
Brick 169
We're about to get into the newest release from The Arsonists
For your listening pleasure. Check it out
It's real smooth
(Intro sample: I'm the Slime by Frank Zappa 1973 album Overnite Sensation)
I'm gonna blow your mind (best believe that)(could ya?)
4X
[GR8 Scott]
It was a
[D-Stroy]
Cool and lonely breezy afternoon in the crib
I just finished doing vocals time to lay some adlibs
You could feel it cause it was the month of June No Question
But still I'm ready for the session with no second (thats right)
So best belive I'll never stop 'cause Hip Hop's my center
And all you fakes'd be dodging motion sensors to enter Aiyyo
Its about that time to rhyme (rhyme) and give 'em what they like
Negative vibes scram I need my fam-i-lam to get me hyped
The Hyper-
[GR8 Scott]
Active turn a rhyme reactive at the smack of instrumental loops
And start the troop like old LL Cool J jumpsuits
The thought recruits the ghetto running youth (without the verbal abuse)
The one that finds scribbling rhymes up in the ace caboose
Could you reduce the negative a just a tad but there you have it
Balance out the scale of false-a and the
'Plause of why the truth prevail
The check is in the mail for all you
Bill collecting leeches
While your rhyme's the type to kill and
Mines'll be the type that teaches
So to
[D-Stroy]
Each his own
My microphone's turned on strictly for flexing
Don't need that comic to marvel I'm uncanny when I X-Men
(LikeTotalEclipseRobSwiftRaidaAndSinista) Uh huh-uh
Correction if I steer stand clear of my lazer beam projection
Having a hard time to get open into my C-Section with cuts
From that DJ spin one to bring perfection (Uh-huh)
You claim you're ill? I got the injection for that infection
Or who want to battle I advise parental discretion
I'm gonna blow your mind (could ya?) 4X
[D-Stroy]
Ever so
[GR8 Scott]
Fresh like sling from 1983 so could it be
That I was born and raised to be an MC
Extraordinaire many thought of confrontation but just (wrong)
Wouldn't dare so I grabbed the microphone and just (right)
Wouldn't share now I'm known to be the one to be the one
To be the known for all you're odd or ordinary
Skip your coronary rip your auditory canal for now
Livin' on the low but little did you know
You'll be into acting with the pros so
[D-Stroy]
So many people trying to dis that and the third
While I'm trying to make The Arsonists a household word
Keep it real got played so I had to change my motto
Or off the head I stay ill like (?)chapo lin corlolados(?)
See mi sabado's gigante picante's my flavor
To stay hot I savor my Arsonists' behavior (thats right)
To set fires as long as I live in this game
The center of attention so you marshmallows feel the flames
Games
[Q-Unique]
People play shame to say you overcrossed my boundaries
to keep 'em coming gave society information
Now they running for the shine
Pennies Nickels Nickles Dimes
Its a happy mother(eh)
Its the one that tapped the (uhhh!)
That you mentioned to the demons that
Went and stole the soul
And got a Public Enemy like
Chuckie straight-up say you know so (ohhh)
Watch the rhymes get written round the running of a clock
Shouts to Co-flow and Non Phixion yo I sees/sieze you at the top...
I'm gonna blow your mind (could ya?) 3X
D-Stroy and [GR8 Scott]
Arsonists is settin fires cause [Arsonists is settin fires cause]
Yo no matter what you say baby [No no matter what you say baby]
From the bottom to the top you know dat

[GR8 Scott]
What

Pick up your microphones ha ha
Pick up your microphones
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinking of all them kids who try to do this
For all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper,
Get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying "True dat"
If only they knew that,
It was you who was irregular,
Sold your soul for some secular
Muzak that's wack,
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style
Your attempts are futile, ooh child
Your puerile,
Brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take, my tape's
Laced with malice
Hands get calloused
From grippin' microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me,
I get Inner Visions like Stevie
See me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed be like Khalil Muhammad
MC's make me vomit
I get controversial
Freak your style with no rehearsal
Oh, contraire mon frere
don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego,
We go, way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or Coleco, Vision
My mind makes incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy
Or Leviticus, God made this word
You can't get with this
Sweet like licorice,
Dangerous like syphillis, yeah.
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do you rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
I used to be underrated
Now I take iron, makes my shit constipated
I'm more concentrated.
So on my day off,
With David Sonnenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out Mazel Tov
Problem with no man
Before black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla
Momma always told me "You're one in a million"
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, "How does it feel?"
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal.
Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout
Brother brother can't you get this through your head
It's a set up by the fed's they're scoping us with their Infra - reds.
How many mic's do you rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do I rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
Too many MC's not enough Mic's
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dice and dynamite like dolomite
double deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke
Startlight to starbrite the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef (I wear my sunglasses at night)
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash your squad and hide your body under my garage.
And when the cops come lookin'
I'll be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Drivin' in my fast car playin' Tracy Chapman
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do you rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, Say me say many, many, many, many
Many, many, many, moni, many, many, many, many, many, many, moni

Now you made me the proudest Daddy,
Girl I'm at a loss for words,
Can't explain the feelings in me,
So proud when I heard,
That we were having a little baby,
Girl I couldn't wipe off my smile,
Heaven went and told the world,
That you were having my child,
Words can't explain it
[Chorus]
Our first born
It's our first, it's our first
Our first born,
It's our first little baby,
Come on, Our First born,
It's our first, It's our first,
Our first born,
It's our first little baby, see'mon
When you had it something went through me, and it hit my soul,
I had no control,
This little life was mine,
And I'll do anything to protect it,
I will never neglect it,
I will always stand right there,
I'm the Daddy, I'm the father,
Now what that means,
I will always love and care for you always,
Come on just say it again,
I'm the daddy, I'm the father,
I just can't explain how I feel about our first
[Chorus]
I'm so proud that we share,
I am so proud that we share,
The most precious thing in the world,
That you could love and share,
Baby I love you,
Yes I do,
Baby do you feel me baby,
Do you hear me, Do you hear me
[Chorus]

Glorified
Glorified, Glorified, Glorified,
Verse: 1
In the game of pain that rang the outlaws
Freaks come through at a 2 no draws
Stop for a sec tiga dont take a pause
If you dont see no pigs then there aint no laws
Get beefy wit me 1 time when i rap
To all them other niggas is like bullets in the back
On the highway going fucka fucka fast
Blowing on a chopper when im mucka mucka mad
Make way steady on the dirty dirty cash
When nothing hurts tiga only when i laugh
Chorus:2x
I glorified the crime rate in my state
The mothafucka thinks is the fliest place
Verse: 2
Die mothafucka you know i aint concerned
You make a mothafucka really do learn
Popeye nigga and go home and eat spinach
Get back on the block i really cant finish
I'm ready to rap till the gods say quit
Until then freaks you gon hear my shit
Parden my manapose and parden my french
And god so check it out, put me in the mix
I'm shooting with my eyes closed at 5-0
Leaving every where i go smelling like a rose
Hanging out the car window whats up hoes
Stepped out and showed the hoes the gangsta pose
Chorus:3x
I glorified the crime rate in my state
The mothafucka thinks is the fliest place
Verse: 3
Your lucky you brothas go boom bang bang
I'm married to the game with a gold weddin' rang
Keep ur daughtars chain my eyes never change
Hard to break like a cuban link chain
Stay back fo a while the mayne in livin color
Instead of right next to me mothafucka
Die yall hi yall fry yall
Spit the truth tell the youth its a lie yall
The only advice i can give to a brotha
is fire up the weed motha fucka
Check it
Chorus:3x
I glorified the crime rate in my state
The motha fucka thinks is the fliest place
Shit can u understand now, I'm glorified

Spendin all their money for a taste of my time

And now I'm ready so baby so give me a sign
If you let me I might let you get a piece of my pie
So break me off, come get me at the front of the line

Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I'm waitin?
Hey pretty baby when you tryin to leave

You know you need me but you greedy so come on don't tease
And leave me by myself beside myself like I can't breathe
And now I'm hurtin God I'm hurtin I'm so weak in the knees
Got your lovin on my brain it creeped in like a disease
I'm as sick as can be I'm at 103, you got that big big heavy
Come and give it to me
Don't drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I'm waitin?
Oh no

Oh no

Take me home

Don't drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball

Give you all my love
Gonna give you my love

I give good love
Gonna give you good love

Gonna give you good love
I want your love
I need your love
I want your love
Gotta have your love

[Chorus]
(Picture me rollin)
Yeah, picture me rollin
Take a picture of it, picture me rollin
Yeah you should, (picture me rollin)
Yeah, picture me rollin
Take a picture of it, picture me rollin
Yeah you should, (picture me rollin)
Chamillitary countin cash
"Picture Perfect" homie, you should take a photograph
(Picture me rollin), picture me rollin
(Take a picture of it, picture me rollin)
Haha, Chamillitary mayne
(Picture me rollin)
You should picture me rollin, take a picture of me
Picture me rollin
Yeah you should, (picture me rollin)
Picture me rollin, take a picture of it, picture me rollin
Yeah, you should (picture me rollin)
Take a pict of me rollin
I didn't fall off like these niggaz was hopin, so they should
(Picture me rollin)
You should picture me rollin
See me shinin, you should picture me rollin
because I'm doin good
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just walkin this (yes), while y'all was talkin this
Burnin up the bootleg market, like I'm an arsonist (yes)
Had to get smart with this (yes), studied and sharpened it
Plot gets darker than the thoughts in a coffin get
Remember I walked into L.A. Reid's offices (yes)
Had to walk outta there feelin like I was not the ish
But they didn't owe me nothin (yes), gave me no promises
But the industry still gonna see me, I promise this
Universal Records (yes), I'm wreckin all the lists (yes)
The crane can't even lift all my accomplishments
Even when I was indie, was bringin y'all the hits
Actin like I was crazy, I got a conscience kid
In a interview they would say you look kinda pissed
Up against the world, middle finger for all the continents (yes)
F. Koopa, what's the best of my compliments?
Indie label, the hell with slavery, I'm all for this (yes)
Like this the damn thanks I get
and thank you, I'ma just focus on the bank I get
Used to be with Paid and Swisha, but I made my "Click"
The game greazy, that's the reason why I think I'm slick (yes)
Lets take it back to the beginning, when I wasn't winnin
With women and gold grinnin, my pockets were so thin and
Chamillion, before the million, no candy and chrome spinnin
Amazing how things still go sour, with no lemon
I'm poor baby, of course little nigga tacky
My Jordans isn't matchin, of course my little hair was nappy
I remember how the rest of the boys was lookin at me
The day that I got cut from the core, like it made 'em happy
Cause your spot is yours (yours), now my locker gettin clean
Not good enough for my team, not good enough for my dream (what?)
Exactly what it is a dream, I acted like a triple beam
Was under the rap game and I turned it into a scheme (yes)
Now when they speak on me, they say it's about the
time that he's got his props, hate when these niggaz doubt me
Now your with your spouse, she used to diss me and now she
missin teeth, lookin like she been kissin on coffee (yes)
I should take your confidence, throw it up in the air and gun it down (down)
But I don't knowin that was goes around, always comes around
Now everybody wanna come around, givin a brother sound
Now you speak just cause you seein how Koopa run it now
[Chorus]

Here
The E-R-I-C-K-S-E-R-M-O-N
I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10 more menace
And I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash, you ain't seen shit yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
'Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin'
You should hope that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin' and bustin'
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin'
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shits thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by U.S.A. and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people
Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin' necks, bustin' caps and breakin' jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
To whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in the wrong camp, punk, stepped on a land mine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brent wood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some bullshit charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a Tech Nine
Yes the brother's back with no knife or axe
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, with guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel
For this shit I kick, it's strictly for my people

[verse 1]
Yo, yo, I know niggas wit honor and will
That'll still crush the blow up and then pass they mama the bill
So i'ma always be able to burn my strip
'cause my bags be stuffed and I burn my tips
And it ain't no tellin what the snub'll do
So when y'all go and cop s's cop one for your mother too
And I'm way better than them other dudes
But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit
'cause I don't suck dick
Sat with the plays and I stood with the cultures
And i'ma always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters
And I control all the fishscale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the kiss is a hustler
[chorus:]
[styles:] he's a hustler
[jadakiss:] I hustle anywhere, any town, any borough, any strip, uh
[s:] he's a gambler
[j:] I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
[s:] he's a gangster
[j:] I always make the paper and the fbi got me on they list, that's why
[s:] he's a ruff ryder nigga, ryde or die nigga
[j:] by the way, did I tell you that my name is kiss?
[verse 2]
And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter'll dust you so get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue m
I'm like lou sims
And i'ma make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building
'cause now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
Alotta niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life
This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips
[chorus]
[verse 3]
Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of mauseburgs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread
Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, 'cause it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name
We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in new york
'cause some of us is runnin from court
Smokin weed, mumblin thoughts
Tryin to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh
[chorus 2x]

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
"Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting,
Scarborough ting from time, G,
Been have up di ting dem from time, G.
So I don't know what's wrong with these lil waste mans out here eh,
Y'all need to know yourself."

This is the master thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclub.net where you can read this
run a plot on a map hyper space 'ya
From the society for scientific exploration
color is vibration, vibration is sound
sound resonates through the mouth check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South, South East, West, south west, east
North, North east, North west
And the black and white images fade
to great sound waves
Track my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
with a bewildering array, of lyrical display
The best of Bis oftenly rearrange
Moto atomic elements, with a deft intelligence
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch
My circularised 3rd Eye, sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria
before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I could've learned more
about the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidian in form
ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold molded in Assyria
with processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
with my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
They burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone
and he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems
but I'll think about going
The process was slow, and the dough was low
but I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
plus I never traveled that far from home
but I heard about the beauty of Sydonian (city of ancient Phoenicia) snow
neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass
I'll be crazy to pass
I like nigerian Jazz
the blue twilight band
that plays tunes from a laser black sax
it sounds so laid back
it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing K-Pax
Ooh how I miss my nautilus
i was told faren goat and mcdotilus did not exist
you have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neo gothic anti-biotics
words concocted from the lyrical lock smith
deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
from every angle the competition gets boxed in
its Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
translate the English alphabet
to the omega text
life is now and death is next
post bond out on bail from the belly of hell
communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
these dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
use the aphrodisiac to get a female
call ginger tie her up and drink her ginger ale
grand maryey for me scotch on the rocks for you
your vocab is smaller than a cup of jewels
in the studio with james lipton
reminiscing about the script that was written
before the beginning
all of a sudden the boo's turned into applause
my jaws stronger then the kenenday Macaws
cant even count the bars
i've expended so far
don't want to rap no more its been so long
i wish the clock would hurry up and tick
im out in the bush and the sticks
humpin a hundred clicks
dr scholes gave me a good fit
me and him went to school together back in 86
when I was really ill
puttin flank energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
you wanna laugh now
and cast your belligerent doubt
show you what poetry is really about
the side affects will make you pass out
followed by skin rash
itching diarrhea nausea and dry mouth
you want a time out?
you better spit a rhyme out
before the community of real mc's die out
college students say to me "you ain't smart"
Record label A&Rs; say: "this ain't art"
these are the contents of the covenant of the art
listen to my chest beat tell me this ain't heart
You gotta be as obsequious
as the Disciples of Jesus
this is my MASTER THESIS

Yeah, some people wonder, you know, well they say: "what have you learned"?
And to your left, your right, your left, your right
It's to your left, your right, your left, your right
To your left, your right, your left, march with me!
It's to your left, your right, your left, your right [x4]
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
In the temple, we cleaning the mental; the evil it lurks
Coming up off of on the corner, with dirtier thoughts
Here's thirty seconds to start
They slither like worms, they jealous of purity
Jealous of people in love;
They caught on a women, destroy the connection, they see that you happy
And here come the scrubs, I'm tellin you bruh
They down with the serpent to get in their mind
Believe the people who witness the Christ
Look at my life, and now they blind
Nobody to find, they sellin' their souls without even knowing I catch em'
Without definitions, and give em reditions of scriptures and shit,
I keep walking knowin' is mine
I walk and I shine in the sublime, gotta ward of all the demons
Outta my thought, they caught, they gone I tell em sit back and wake em',
Literally thuggin, just come in and clog up their mind
What have I learned? What have I learned?
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
With a bounty on my head, and the county holdin' my mind
Angels grippin' my spine, dear lord, these are scandalous times
We livin' in revelations, nation against nation
Blood in the hood on the boat like Haitians
Me and little brother, we are runnin' for salvation
Everyday, comin' and facing temptation
Casin' joints, with the base and the point, the place with a dutch
Little joy, little souljah boy, you better keep your boys with no noise, no voice, and? no choice
Runnin, we stop, you better watch the cops, you better get off the block
You mean to tell me that motherfuckers is still sellin' rocks?
And they mob with the glock, and they nod... Allah
Who do you think you are? Dead in the heart
Dead man walking, man don't even start
A tear for the above, but we thuggin' in the park
Another? on the porch with a sawed of shotgun, let it spark, on the multitude, is that all you got?
Trying to shock the dude, and give him... in his heart
And laugh at him fast like... and the ark
Rubbin' the eye, you better hold that stash
Weeded out, and baby, even now
A poor child in the hood, no hood, no doubt, no wood, no mort, no dream, no style
Ambulances, coroners, and some that never know no doors
Brain cartiledge up on that floor, it's one friend, please, let me tell you one more
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
Grind in the days in a maze
Amazed with the phase in the plague of a homeboy blazed
Now the homeboy slayed in the streets, so crazed
Know that he prayed, that shit is played
It's ok, it's alright
Spirit will be better when you see that light
When you see that flight
And Allah provide, perfections, let's go take a ride
Loadin' up clips, hollow tips, ready for murder, swallow this
Follow this, model this; with death, you don't have to swallow shit
When it's bottled up and it tastes like piss
Ridin' on up...
... with the hurt and pain, but the hurt remains
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms
What have I learned?
It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern
See the good in the ones that have burned
And you never got all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord
Heavenly choir, now we are in Church

(Verse 1)
I?m the greatest escape artist the hardest situation is getting free
From the terror that keeps confiding in me,
I got to be Better than Houdini and David Blaine
With no magician, No illusions, No subliminal, No hypnosis to your brain, I?m untrained
Children should not try this at home at all, I?m a free lance professional
And this is on my own I staged the whole bit
I drink and talk a little shit and see who got the balls to pull a strap
And really use it, That?s where the fun comes in
Cause after they pop me they got to hide my body
So no ones suspicious about who shoot me
It?s interesting me to see the means and the tactics and tape
To make sure that my death is tucked away nice and safe

Sunshine?s for suckers and queers
That?s what they told me when they rolled me in the carpet,
And through me over the bridge just like I was some garbage
Of course I was uncounsous not dead in the sense they thought I was
But a slug in your dome will get you caught up 'cause
I?m not invincible I could die a million times
Each time more painful than the first, Still I survive
Both hands are tide behind my back as I?m breathing dirty water
And my legs are been mauled to death by the sewer rats
I move erratically to make them work for there meal
I?m dislocating my shoulder?s I slip out just like banana peel
I?m close to drowning again
Ten minutes and countin me to them
Is my record so I feel it like I'm ahead
In points was the view from the west but it's all good
Best believe that your boy will be back to walk the neighborhood
In no time water logged and bullet ridden
They be like, ?I can?t believe that he did it, He really escaped.?

[Not too sure about these!]
No stun, I'm runnin with some gangstas
Not no bitchass wangstas
But some real gangsta fed my legs into a woodchipper
But the blades got caught on my bones I woke up screaming
And noticed that my right foot and... leg was gone
My eye popped out the socket and dangling on the cheek
They must have strangled me to sleep 'cause I'm unable to speak
Must have screamed just inside of my head
'cause they still think that I'm dead
They usin a shovel to scrape away clumps of the red
From out the chipper they pop my legs out
So they can chop me up manual bag me up and throw me out
No sweat, give me a week and a roll of some duct tape
And a shovel to dig the rest of my body up and I'm straight
(Hook)
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain
(In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restrain
(Your restrain)
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain
(In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restrain
(Your restrain)
[Till the end]

Yo, yo
Back in black, it's your local superhero from the hood
Ironman Stark's got the good
Not that good good like Snoop
I bulletproofed the Coop'
Polished up the suit and gathered the troops
Got a brand new ray gun
Me and DOOM heading down to the range
To shoot in the matrix
Catch bullets with my hands and teeth, I break faces
Wild car chases, don of all ages
I saved the world that's fucking history pages
My Wu crescent signs in the sky at night
Watch how my eagle on my wrist take off into flight
All my might, white glass teeth that write
Ain't a bird or a plane it's a ghost on the mic
Two hammers and a diamond blade sword
Thicker than the Ford F1-50
Niggas couldn't lift me
As if, stance mad stiff
Metal Face DOOM, beware, he bear gifts
Gab for the shift, overwork, overtime
Jerk you been warned, go for mine
In the dance hall play the wall like handball
Till his pants fall, brawl till last call
Loose cannon, squeeze a drip
Off to rip this one for the Gipper, get gypped
That nig' ya dig don't tip the strippers
Foamposite mask, matching slippers
Yo where's Starks? Backpack of ammo
Warriors said let your flags blow, camo
These dudes is toys like Wham-O
Damn though, chip paint driving on the gravel with the Lambo
Blamo

[Jamie Foxx- Verse 1]
Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's
Not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
(I believe in people like you)
[Jamie Foxx- Verse 2]
So who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I think there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)
[Drake]
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk, you just saying sh-t
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, yeah, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen,
Cuz man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it and I fall..
[Jamie Foxx]
I swear I always fall for your type, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
(I believe in people like you)

And now, my name is Adrock I've got a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd, well, the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell
And when I start to rhyme, well, I rhyme the rhyme well
Oh you didn't know I got the flow
I could sing, rap, dance in just one show
With the cornbread stuffin' with the Blimpie Bluffin
Ooh, that ' Yosi with the fresh muffins
Hey, could you please pass me the peas?
And let me get a tissue if you think you're going to sneeze
I'm the player and the coach, I'm no roach
I bought my grandma a brand new broach
Well I'm MCA with a story to tell
When I rock the crowd I rock the crowd well
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme, well, I rhyme the rhyme well
'Cause I'm a craftsman, who ain't fastin'
I'll take you to task, everyone of ya'll draftsman
I'm rehearsin' and ain't maskin'
Bringin' the beat back and keepin' it lastin'
Keepin' it top notch, beyond passing
Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't flashin'
I'm party-crashin' so you better batten
Down those hatches stop procrastin'
Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well
Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
I'm not even asking, "yo what's cracking?"
Serving MC's on a platter like baked Alaskan
So start packing because I'm back in
The game of hi-phop representing Manhattan
Now push the pause button then start ducking
Shh, you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton
E.F (shhh)
Hutton

Yo, it's the nigga with the nasty flow and the clean rag six-four
With the D's spinnin' I can bag a hoe
Top down, so my rag can show, whatever in the dutch
Purple or orange, haze, it's just a bag of 'dro
Hit snatch with my khakis on, Aladdin Lounge
In Mark Jacobs denim and Don Magli's on
I'm a gangsta and the birds they love it
20 with a babyface and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
You can't buy a Ferrari, fuck it, cop lle' from J
The bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage
He order rock and cover it, the dimes is free
The quarters is 75, the ball is live
Ain't nobody fumblin' on my block
We in the field like Biggs or Marshall Faulk, we runnin' the rock
Nothin' less than a hundred a pop, anything less you a cop
Shoot you and take your vest and your glock, motherfuckers
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin' on sticky green, you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh, so clean, you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin' G's, you got to come fuck wit me
I'm in the streets like the place is mine, told to cover my tracks
I push paper to increase my shine
I'm on my chief, jumpin' out the wagon like Tyco
And get the kind of paper that these niggaz'll die fo'
Bossed out, camouflage under my vest B
Motorbike, fast cars, broads and jetskis
Rule number 1, keep your eye on your cash flow
'Cause rule number 2, will get rid of your best so
None of 'em best show, ridin' in stress mode
'Less they got petrol, pushin' that Benz slow
Pick up the Game, let's count some cash
Then we, get to the do', then you put on your mask
On some other shit, ridin' wit'cha boy now

[Shawn Wigs]
I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on
[Chorus: Eamon]
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is hold on) That's what I'm do, yeah
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is) I'ma try to (Hold on) hey
[Shawn Wigs]
I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'ma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me
[Chorus]
[Eamon]
But I'ma try to, hold on, and be strong
Cause this time, you're so wrong
But I wait, and, I long
For you touch, but you're gone
All these tears, and all this pain
I'll never, never, feel the same
I keep control, I lift my soul
I sing my song, I hold on
[Chorus: x2]

Gotta have that.....uh uh uh

Now who I am is who I'll be until I die either accept it or don't

but if we gon' be dogs then you stuck with it!
Let me go my way but walk with me

Share my pain, make it a little easier to deal with it
cause despite all the fame YOU I'm a keep it real with it (true)!
Rob and steal withcha' dog nigga what
ride till we die, on till it's up.
Love is love and I enjoy the love,
but when it's conflict then it destroys the love.
You can't toy with love, niggas take to the heart
you ain't gon' find too many niggas willing to, bark in the dark.(come
on!)
Keep your head from the start, don't fuck it up now,
later on they be hit like, fuck it how??
You my dog and I die for you, keep it like that,
give me unconditional love, and I give it right back.
chours: repeat 2x
Most niggas make movies, but niggas like us make it happen'
the shit we used to do never thought we would make it rappin'.
But now we here, at the same place at the same time,
and got jokes cause now niggas get it, with the same rhyme.
Yeah niggas is living comfortable, cause life is all good
but one thing we must remember, is that life is all hood.
And the casket's all wood and we all take there one day,(shit)
shit today is Sunday we both can be there on Monday.
Life is funny like that, WHAT bug the fuck out,
sometimes I take it to the church in terms of thug the fuck out.
Niggas get dropped the fuck out they boots, violatin' families rules
motherfucker stay in your shoes!
Now see what you need to do, is chill shorty
'body please come and get him before I, kill shorty.
I will do for my niggas as they would do for me
bust a faggot like you for free.
COME ON!
chours: repeat 2x
I'm always surrounded by dogs, for the love
only niggas I fuck wit is thugs nigga what.
Blood in blood out ???? homes,???? homes
when we smoke them chromes, and how we broke them bones.
While the last niggas is ass niggas,
the skimask niggas to trash niggas they ass niggas pussy.
And half you cats can't even flow,
and when I hear y'all niggas around my head, well you know.
But that's a whole 'nother issuse, right now we own this
we keep spittin' like this, how the FUCK we gon' miss?
Cause the camp is strong, and the stamp is strong
double love motherfucker keep the casketes flowing.
You done got yourself, caught up in some shit you can't handle
and you know I can't stand you, you're man too.
This one time I'ma letta dog be a dog,
but I'ma see you in the ringing when it's on then it's on.
chorus: repeat 2x
dog nigga what?

where's my dog?

What's up butterfly, what's happenin'?
If it's swoon I can dig
I peep out the flowers when they bloom, if you dig
Sisters do their dips to our booms cause they dig
Muslims add perfumes and the zoom be a dig
I scoped out as a sprout then mamma said to dig
The mind then the butt cause the drama ain't to dig
Lovely little honeys in their crews is what I dig
If they fake the fig it's the blues child dig
{want some of my soda?}
Fine they be mega, sexy they be ultra
But don't enroll in pageants to get judged by the chauva's
Crazy fly whips, baggy jeans and sneakers
Silver hoops and jeeps, hip-hop in the speakers
The gag rule is bunk, it's like chains on the rump
We help to liberate through this butt-shaking funk
Nikki giovanni and maya flamm
With poems so I tried for the units, cause damn
{all together}
Swoon units

To the gals I am hip
The funky naturals is the ones, are you hip?
If you dis a sis' then you ain't actin' hip
Check doodle, silk and butter cause we be black and hip
Silky like jazz silky beats to move the hip
Milky with pizazz kinda sheik and very hip
The chocolate and the braids and the eyes be so hip
That insects for the units gettin' live gettin' hip
{i think you need a quota!}
The gardens known as cities sprout ferns and tulips
A sexy "hi" followed by requests to do it
When funky duds is drapin' off the curves of a vixen
And fig leaf sugars start to sprout elix 'em
And roll with the lines, damn they be fine
Ask t from the deep, we heard it through the vine
I keep cans of bait for the fishes in aquariums
Boosting me with verve like marine boys aquagum
{all together}
Swoon units

Run and tell your mom about this
The original swarm whether cold whether warm
I, the doodlebug knowledge every form
It's a beautiful day by the park take a seat
As bosoms float by keepin' doodlebug in heat
Chocolate treats, silky bronze skin
Butter sees what I see and gives me a grin
All is good in the land of the honey-dip lovelies
Don't wanna be 'em just to see 'em
Ow!
Oh that's what's happenin' y'all
Yeah that's what's happenin'
Oh I see what's happenin' now, yeah
I see what's happenin' now butterfly, yeah

Its David Banner yall
And its Nitty yall
Chamillionaire yall
And we go a little something like this
Have you ever rolled in a Rolls Royce
If you want to girl take your clothes off
On that Rick Flair money everywhere
From the South dog, kush in the air
J's on number four, coming down clean, only with hoes
Cardiers on, or them new Saces, 50 stacks cash, yeah Nitty got me
Big cars, big rims, Southside wearin' lil' Timbs
I don't spit bars I buy cars,
Still in the hood I don't hang with stars
[Chorus]
DJ brings your girls and I can bring my G's
Rubber-band stacks I guess its all for free
We can spend money like its falling from a tree
Leave it all behind and come and ball with me
Yeah them big stacks we can bring 'em out
Poppin' rubber-bands know what I'm talkin' bout
Yeah them big stacks we can bring 'em out
Poppin' rubber-bands know what I'm talkin' bout
50 thousand up, 50 thousand down
Money in the air, money on the ground
See it layin' 'round, while them haters frown
Where the money go, gotta ghost and lay it down
European broads, take 'em over seas
Money on the bed, layin' over G's
Keep the Dessert E, I've been known to squeeze
Turn 'em round and be poppin' like its soda
I am so fresh, nobody flier
Need a breathe of a air, I am Lucifer
Open the garage, you ain't messin' with me
Two SS's like the word Mississippi
[Chorus]
'68 Chevy, what they like dog
All grown men, watch the screens fall
Now and laters in my paint
Throw a deuce up, like I'm with the Saints
Hit the block beatin', know you hear it dog
Four 15's about to knock my damn tag off
Them to the mall, watch I'm 'bout to ball
I'ma shut it down, cause I'ma buy it all
DJ brings your girls and I can bring my G's
Rubber-band stacks I guess its all on me
Makin' money easy, yall make it hard
Call Cole He tell him put it on the black card
[Chorus]
Whats up, yeah
You know what it is
Play-maker SRC
Big face lets go, yeah
Come and ball with me
Come and ball with me

Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a Greyhound
That's what he think of her
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the big apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Feel the negro that's filled with an equal match road
Destination unknown
She's Little Bow Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
She can earn with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'
She's cravin' that bible belt town
So she crawls back on the Greyhound
Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face
I know how to get there
And I give you my word that I get you there safe
I don't need to check your baggage
I don't need to know your name
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
Fresh new Gucci belt, bound
Fast to the city scape
Dash to deliver fate
Stashed in this duffel bag, proud
He's no scaredy cat
Life always spared in thy name
That the gamblers fold
No chips if the scramble got cold
But them warm cushions and them soft bus seats
Push that second thought along
Beneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps 'til it's night time
Then connects in the streets like a pipe line
In dark shades he supplies dark brigades
Of lost souls with his chemical morsels
He's no lab tech
He was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond
Assets he was drawn to
Had him spinnin' the wool over his mother's eye
He's the black sheep
His pops career driven, he's the backseat
The man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise
That the man bought eyes to his pay per view
The kind of paper make a fool shoot a staple through
And take the label too
Until he's campaign
Unitl a pancake pocket change the landscape
Take a short visit home in the town
It's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound
Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face
I know how to get there
And I give you my word that I get you there safe
I don't need to check your baggage
I don't need to know your name
All I need to know is
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed

She got me so good right now
I'm feeling so good right now
I can give you what you want baby
I'mma even let you take it all baby
I waited my turn, I put in that work
I buried these niggas, put them in the dirt
I run the Empire, the power is mine
Take over the game, I put that on my mom
You ain't wasting my time, ain't wasting my time is wasting my money
Got back on my grind, do this on my own, they know I got work
They know I'mma shine
I hear ya hidden agendas
I'm praying this shit'll offend ya
They all got they hands to the ceiling 'cause I got that work
Got that work, get employed
If you want that loud, I can bring the noise
They need 3D vision just to see ya boy
Brand new foreign car, you should see my toy
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
I got this slap from my mother
I put that on my brothers
Catch me out with your lady
I'm in that foreign, no other
Ain't gotta talk about cash, let it rain, it's covered
She just wanna drink and fuck, I told her we are not lovers
For the love of this money, I probably hurt your own family
Got that work, work, work, I know that he understanding me
Any rapper you can find, I bet you he is a fan of me
Claiming he got that crown, I put that in the hands of me
'Cause they call me the greatest, I shit on the haters
Going way up like elevators
I'm higher than y'all, flier than y'all, call me sire
Claim you do this? Claim you do that? Don't like liars
Got that work, get employed
If you want that loud, I can bring the noise
They need 3D vision just to see ya boy
Brand new foreign car, you should see my toy
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work

Know I put in work, know I put in work
Half bro hating on worth, hating on worth
I did that
They hate on

They hate on, but she know
Got that work, get employed
If you want that loud, I can bring the noise
They need 3D vision just to see ya boy
Brand new foreign car, you should see my toy
Work, got that work, work, got that work

Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work

If faith can move the mountains
Let the mountains move
We come with expectation
Waiting here for you, I'm waiting here for you
You're the Lord of all creation
And still you know my heart
The Author of Salvation
You've loved us from the start
Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Alleluia
You are everything You've promised
Your faithfulness is true
And we're desperate for Your presence
All we need is You
Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Alleluia

Alleluia, singing alleluia, alleluia
Waiting here for You

Waiting here for you
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
We're singing Alleluia
I'm singing Alleluia
Waiting here for you
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Alleluia

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 1]
Finally from every dimension with few restrictions
From up north to the youth detentions, I lay it down
Clear enough for who choose to listen, we all thorough
Infected by cruel intentions, but who the wise
The lies got two disguises, the surprise
Is to know when to utilize it, stay alert
The street talkers say the worst
So overall you gotta watch where you play in the dirt, it's just the rules
A killer could be just as cool, it's no image
Camouflaged right next to the fools, so who's who
It's the game that chooses you
A lot of shit is more easier to say than do, show and prove
Maintainers never blow they cool
Understand, every man should really know these jewels, I'm feeling live
Slim with a gorilla vibe
Away from haters 'cause I know what they feel inside, but never worry
[Chorus]
Blowing cess in the dark (What your day about?)
Playing chess in the park (What your day about?)
Taking trips every week (What your day about?)
Spending chips on them freaks (What your day about?)
Getting money all night (What your day about?)
Betting houses on the dice (What your day about?)
Got your vest and your heat (What your day about?)
Get respect in the street (What your day about?)
[Verse 2]
Young in the mind with a old spirit
Hot blood with a heart that's so frigid, melodic music
Expressed through slow lyrics
I only spit it for the niggas that hold digits, and don't front
I know about the coke blunts and Remy nights
Got a cousin up in Elmira sending me kites
I'm felt, the ice in my ears don't melt
I could drink a whole bottle for delf and won't belch
Believe it's the same me ducking the D's
Eighty-six with the do-rag, cuff in the Lee's
Appraise this, biological' I'm ageless
Psychologically, I show amazement
Salute, been blessed with the [...?] of a coupe
Hoping the real just respect what I'm trying to produce
Quiet Money is the empire, bigger than rapping
Fuck niggas 'cause I been fired, that's what's that
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
From the streets to the track board
Bubble up, from the crack to the rap laws, visualize
We all uncivilized, the trained behavior
As kids taught to memorize, copy and mimic
I travel through the blocks that's dimmest
Fly nigga, use my teeth to pop the top off a Guinness, never hate
With the hunger of a heavyweight
I stay balanced in the mind when I meditate, and blow trees
Every verse is like a o-z
I know niggas in the 'hood like they know me, so no beefing
It's nothing that could stop me from eating, too in tune
Taught to heal through the doctrines and teaching, redeemed
For women I'm the man of their dreams, stand alone
When I zone nothing coming between, let's get money
The trick is to flip money, double up
Dirty or legit money, it's all the same
[Chorus 2X]

Smoky Lah, me got flav
Smoky Gunz, Cocoa B's
Who want to look like, want to act like us
Want to be like, roll the trees like us
Want to talk like want to walk like us
Want to flip like get ripped like us
Want to act like know you're black like us
Want to flip like kick shit like us
Want to bust like you ain't rough like us
Tek and Steele, Won on Won, Smoky Guns, what?
Ding! That's the sound of the bell
"Oh shit!" is all you heard before you fell
To the canvas, all washed up like my dirty drawers
And pants get, try to challenge get damaged
Plain and simple, with bandages around your temple
Easily erased out the picture like pencil
Peeped me once, saw me again got your pistol
I put permanent fear in your heart like a dimple
Son hold my A.V. let me rock this no-body
Comin' out the closet tryin' to stop my money?
Actin' like you're sweet cause he ain't see me in the streets
Spit that blood out and get back up on your feet
You called me I was there on some Candyman shit
Wear that ass out in front your kids and your bitch
Hurt you to the boards, put the ten to your jaw
Walk away, parley in front of Achmed's store
We don't give a WHAT about you, tell them niggas who sent you
Let em come, have em all open wide like dentals
Heard they work for cheap, think I might rent you
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to
Nigga I'd wish you'd, talk about runnin' for guns
Get your Bankhead Bounce like insufficient funds
Left ass-out a home beggin' like bums
Cut off, swept off the floor like crumbs
I'm from N.Y.C.I.T.Y. stay high
Lazy eye ghetto celeb rap guy from Bed-Stuy
Splash in two lines, me no long rhymes
Losing your attention taking up your time
I gets mine and breathe, bout it bout it like P
Too many wannabe me, want to flow blow hold dough
Like Smoky (Smoky Lah), fly across seas
Blow shows for B.C.C. (knock you out), but you can't be
You heard me, you soft like porridge
You ain't gettin' money and you have no courage
(Aye yo son, let me at they ass son)
Introducing, the one who gets you bugged like a Lucie
Same height, same weight, same fight skills like Bruce Lee
Try me, ready for those who want to harm me
Don't toy with me, you want to be all you can be, join the Army
I swarm like bees plus sting too, bring grooves
I blow em out like hankies (hachoo!) nab you like cops do
For the longest I've been waitin', to take it to these Jafaicans
Corner eyeballin' on the moves that we was makin'
Thinkin' that we lost it cause our line was closed
Can't stop a hungry nigga with nothin' to live foe
I'ma see that dough, many hustlers I know
Three car longshark white chalk and celo
Yo, I think I'll take this time to remind you
Not to sit by the line, test mine, Crime Stoppers won't find you
Before we come kickin' your door to the floor
Throw you to the wall, making you our prisoner of war
Cut you too short to take walks with Tattoo
Attack you from your front open you back with my scalpel
Snatch two, niggas from the crew if they got
Anything to do with motherfuckers coming back to avenge you
I intend to, get down for my temple
Keep a strong mental when dealin' with evils that men do
Them who, fail to comprehend I
Recommend you remember you're dealin' with men who'll
Send you, off in a coffin
Cause far too often niggas are gettin' lost and it's costin'
Body parts, from anybody that starts
We play the hackers, takin' rappers apart
Dissect em, from they rectum, to they necks
Double check them make sure shit's correct then direct them
To the section, where the session's, in progression
Where you come to get blessed by Smif-N-Wessun

They killed my baby, oh, God, they killed my baby
(Order in the court, order in the court)
I will make you pay for this you murderers
(Order in the court, order in the court)
(I said order in the court now)
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendant please, rise and approach the bench
Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh, yeah, don't forget my retained balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity
Claiming demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
Can you please explain to this court
How these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen?
Be a witness, as I excersize my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz, in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth the nurses surrounded my with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell, in an Islamic Temple
I'm fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes, you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I'm obsessed
Giving niggaz brain dimples
Dragging they asses on a hook by they temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
'Cause when I kill them, I'm not leavin' one element to autopse
First I'll assassinate 'em
And them I'll cremate them
And take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate 'em
Or creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't trying to hear it
Buck, Buck, Buck, I'll give your ass a Holy Spirit
Stressed full, try to avoid all impure thoughts, I am loosing my mind
Can you please explain to this court when these problems first began?
The year 84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil gen
I realize my ideas has spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs
And shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a Holy Tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open, so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands, feet to the form of the cross, ah, I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye, refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my face
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape
Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca, carajo, cono
Calm down people, please, calm down
Let us please, proceed with the defendants explanation
Enta the realms of understanding
And take good heed and you could bleed
While I'm standing, three stages of pure hell
Justifications of red cells, rain drops hits the pelv
Path is dull and narrow
You're stalked by a shadow
I pierced your skull with a fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose
You better hurry
Don't stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there's fire
On you left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor?
It's a claw, took his fucking ass to the fucking core
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some more
And watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor
Worms that dig your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain
You can't stand, you're up to your hands in quick sand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matta
Stab you with a dagga of Jacob's Ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused, and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz
Guilty, next case

You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad
Bet they never saw this comin'
Size 5'6" crop top and hip-huggers
Cinnamon Big Red MAC gloss, her lips covered
Couldn't tell you how I felt then, hope this does it
And when we out in public, got you blushin' and all that
Hook my homeboy up wit' ya cousin and all that
We can hop in my third whip and swerve shit, my turn
Aye, how many times you heard this? (You're too bad)
But you don't make me nervous
I take you somewhere phones ain't got service
Grab a twelve-pack, let me nail that
Aye, I can't even smell that
And I can tell that you treat your body well
Gon' give 'em hell, yeah

You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad
Aye, and I never saw this comin'
Runnin' through twelve-pack magnums, them big rubbers
Now she wit' OPM, we can do big numbers
Her old boyfriend realizin' he did love her
I wake up every mornin' same time, like ten-somethin'
Do some push-ups, couple crunches to "Been Thuggin'"
Hit the studio, and I spend somethin'
Buy a house first, then I'm a go get my wrist flooded
'Cause money get niggas in the club, the list doesn't
I only wanna wear my own clothes like Ben Huggins
And stay in big casinos, navy chinos
All weed, nigga, no premos, haha yeah
Still watchin' Mo' Better Blues
Stay in, order food, white robe, get her nude (Woo)
From rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

Thought about dropping a duece but you know I took out me a 7th
Always preaching to the streets so you know that I feel like a reverend
My potna asked me for a 7th you know that I gave him a 10
He asked me for the BMW you know that I gave him the Benz
Vacuum seal a hundred up for the rainy days
Get on my knees Lord can you take this pain away
I can't even count the money up I made today
Since I ran them bands up these niggas changing face
I got that paper work
I count that paper first
I heard you niggas be snitching

You know my paper dirty
Get in the kitchen I was born for this
40 thousand for the charm for this
Swear to God I was born for this

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
Ca$h Out
Let's Go
Carter X

Cole World, DJ Khaled!
Yeah, back from the dead
Like Michael Jackson in red jackets, with naps in my head
Who's white or black, it's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with these square rappers
My guest room's got plantinum plaques, and an air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you
Word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought can occur to you
My next album flop, then I'm goin pop, like Nelly
With tops dropped on convertible Porsches
Born Sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin'
Fightin' depression I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear black nigga count stacks, count stacks
Forty thousand in my pocket (you see it)
Another twenty on the way (you see it, ay)
I got a fish for a dollar (you see it, uh)
Five hundred for the Jays (you see it, ay)
I get money out the ass (you see it)
I thought I'd never see the day (you see it, ay)
They put a price on my head (you see it)
But they don't ever have to pay (you see it, ay)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
'Cause heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day
But for now I'm cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
Now get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Tell my story I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen, one day, hey
Yeah
Omission's usually, an admission to guilt
Hari Kari yourself, all the way to the hilt
You get nothin', no love
Zip, zero, zilch
We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth
There's a Judas in every crew, concealed in a kiss
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits
Fucks sake you niggas emanate a feminines traits
Bitch nigga when could never relate
Nah, cause man you niggas is birds
You learn that at bird school, or somethin'
You eaten that bird food, or somethin'
You sick with that bird flu, or somethin'
That's my word, cause every where I turn
When folks I known for years, that couldn't pronounce my name
And asking me for pics, there's something bout this game
It's somethin' for the bitches, it's somethin' for the bitches

Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know? The nigga stole my dough
So I reached in the closet for the 4-4
(Whatta you know?)
Jus' hold on, just wait a minute it's gone
Along with my big bad nickel-plated
Whatta you know? The fucker took my phone
I still can't believe that he robbed my home
Whatta you know? I think he got to the herb
And the ferria, and the jewelery, and the Mossberg
Whatta you know? I can't find my keys to the 6-5
All the way live on D's
Whatta you know? I can't find my Rolex
With the 21 diamonds, shinin' on flecks
Whatta you know? When I find that mark-ass nigga
I'ma cut out his fuckin' heart
Whatta you know? I came up on this baller
For the dollar and the weed sack, and his impala
Whatta you think? When you can't trust your so-called homie
Like me, and you thought that you know me?
Whatta you feel? When you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?
Whatta you know? I took your loot and the jewels
With the Buddha and the laptop in the nickel-plated tool
Whatta you know? Now I run the show
With the phat pockets and the nigga's fly gold
Whatta you think? When you ass gets jacked
By a homie who was supposed to have your back?
Whatta you know? I'm rollin' in my zone
And I think I see the Puto who rigged my home
(Whatta you know?)
I got the glock in the glove, should I dump on the man
Leave him lying in the mud?
Whatta you know? he pulled out my 4-4
Now I got no choice, so I let it all flow
(Whatta you know?)
The motherfucker's all blastin' 4-5 equal
In time for some tractions
(Whatta you know?)
Slide action, no question forty-five
Slug is bad for your complexion
(Whatta you know?)
The Puto's cryin' like a bitch
Now the Puto's lyin' in a fuckin' ditch
(Whatta you know?)
You can't even trust your fuckin' best homeboy these days, homes
(Whatta you know?)
You got to sleep with one nine fuckin' open
(Whatta you know?)
Paybacks a motherfuckin' bitch'
(Whatta you know?)
That Puto should've watched his fuckin' back
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?

At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
But one day you'll pay
Doomed to this kid that you fueled with anger actions
Disgust mostly sick most never have satisfaction
Till your bones melt high incident clips and crumple zones
Hold a fix on you eternal intruder interrupting my zone
Dwell the matter I must follow why you proposed only the lonely know
Swallowed my mother when she was hollow
Who can blame a woman like her, singular parent
One love already dissolved and the solution left polluted
Two kids with a father who broke out as resoluted
So suck it she needed love and you provided false clout
Stomping on the bottom man and I wish she just walked out
Knew you was jacked as a stepfather, bit my tongue on the issue
Next to stormy weather and forced tolerance but secretly vexed
Wish I would have spoke on it but why deny the bliss
Mom's with a new husband casting needles puncture pressure
Briefly lifted the guilt from a divorce snuffing her pleasure
Now you're all up in the family tree, come broken nuclear
With termites corroded in your veins and elected to drown the pain
But the pain couldn't quite die with a thrown back whiskey sour
Puritan, crushing Moms between rocks for at least an hour
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
That's why
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have had too many beers
Now every night of my life he beats his wife
[Until the day I die]
Until the day I die
Timepiece must of read early morning at least
So I lay death's cousin, woken by the sonics of the beast
That somewhere deep beneath me a fracture had seized at my neck
Breath was it, a flag that marked the end of my peace
Conference of the birds I heard my mother dove cry
Not absurd just routine I'd learned
Just keep my fucking grill locked and hope the entropy stops me process
Stepfather's got to fight verbally when his liver's soaked
And products come in bottles stuck with drunken last nerve up too close
But I couldn't sense the distinction from the other nights' livest wires
Ceremony's sparked again a dry one in comparison to this one
Handing crutches to my psyche, I was tripping
Huddled up clutching sis I think I heard a dress ripping
I should of reacted to that
But I didn't know the extent, please
You could of caught him in time
Yeah, that thought's occurred to me constantly
Now I've been digging my head and I don't know what he wants from me
Until one of us is dead I suppose
That's why
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have had too many beers
Now every night of my life he beats his wife
[Until the day I die]
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Much more than abrupt I heard the silence erupt
But it was just a touch of tough love that I heard from above
The calm and the climate confused me
The dawn was a floozy
Barely risen but still beckoning to me
The song of the night's events amused me, morbidly
In a petrified state I wait, to Deadwood on duty
Just tempers flared I figured woozily
When all is dead and done a pair is just as fucking happy as they choose to be
Now off to where the wild things dwell for shuteye
The prospect bored me, awakened by the step sounds coming towards me
A quick glance at my mom's darkened silhouette in the hallway assured me
So I sunk with the hope that hibernation would cure me
And slept my last sleep while I counted clone sheep
And dreamt about nothing for the last time ever
The ignorance was blissful just a recollection
Of the gift of innocent times from a merciful deception
Woke to hazy landscapes to find my world defied the laws my mind mandates
Patching jugulars with Band-aids
The turn on you laid well above my bed
Were here and only barely through the shock of what her broken face told me
You should have known what happened
I was young and oblivious
He almost killed your mom
If I knew I could have done something
You'll never see him again
Yeah but I see him every night
And cover my ears in tears as he beats his fucking wife
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have had too many beers
Now every night of my life he beats his wife
[Until the day I die]

Until the day I die

Fight to win, stand up straight
No debate, pushed by hate
Concentrate, penetrate, generate
Motivate, life by faith
Keep believin, I know the reason
It's the season, now's the time
Keep on dreaming, keep on leading
Keep on fighting!
I am fighting for the liberation
Of voices with something to say
Like many before me, for glory
You have to stand in harm's way
I'm no savior, just a soldier
Soldier with an order
I have no choice but to trust the God
Cause it must be done
My only fear is what might happen
If I didn't fight to win
If I lose, then it was worth dying for
If I win, then I only live to fight again
If I lose, then it was worth dying for
If I win, then I only live to fight again
Who are? We are, they are too
Contained by ?
Who are? We are, they are too
Contained by ?
Should be proud for the courage
The courage to think out loud
You'll find your way to be foolish enough to be playful
And as soon as you see sunlight again
Get up and fight to win!
If I lose, then it was worth dying for
If I win, then I only live to fight again
If I lose, then it was worth dying for
If I win, then I only live to fight again
To your last breath
Never lose sight
?
Fight!
? that you tried everything in life
Fight!
Keep your head up

Baby sometimes I feel so naive
Thinking you would come back to me
Say I fucked up, I'd have to agree
But second chances I do believe in
Just give me one reason, we fight, make up then fuck
Girl that's the sequence
I've been dreaming about the most recent
I don't lie, no I don't pretend
And your guard up, that's defense
Let it down, girl I swear I won't let you down
I ain't 2Pac, I don't get around
Was cool at the first but I get it now, I get it now
You know all of my secrets and
You know all of my weaknesses
I can't get after someone else, none of these weak bitches
Gotta tell them hoes keep distante
This how you was s'ppose go deep in it
Please don't do that with no one else
Just me, is that too much?
Is that too much, yeah
Is that too much, oh yeah
Am I asking for too much?
Say this shit once, say this shit two times
I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine
I know I fucked up one too many times
Is that too much?
Truth be told I know that somebody
Somebody as real as me, someone as sincere as me
That's what I'm afraid of
Don't you dare give him the same love
'Cause what that man do girl, I can do it
Hold up one time baby girl, I can prove it
But this right here, so time consuming
And this right here got my mind confusing
What now what now, one day one day you'll come around
Like fuck them niggas, I'll shut 'em down
Sex Mami I'm needin' it
Thirsty much I gotta replenish
If I get it back you know I'm keepin' it
Baby, I been deep in my thoughts like
Is that too much, yeah
Is that too much, oh yeah
Am I asking for too much?
I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine
I know I fucked up one too many times

CHORUS:
You think you got it, but you really don't got shit
You be hatin' because she hopin' on this dick
We gonna get high tonight
Most niggaz hate about the shit they can't control
But I'm laid back smokin' on this dro

They were afraid and you can tell it by the feelings
They fuck it

Haters pictin' about their trap
Money keep coming
Niggaz know how this means smokin' a bucket
Never fuck with beginners
Never fuckin' with bitches
You're talkin' about bitches
They know I get this
Come on and you'll get it
You know I shit it
I left it all for my drill
They will catch phases
They saw me catching bails
Catching the paper they saw me making some sales
Before they block it, they say we're tougher than nails
Every day I had your face
You bring this shit even though haters spread
Waiting the long phase
I know the niggaz gonna feel this
CHORUS:
You think you got it, but you really don't got shit

Keeping it continental
As long as this bitch is into
Smokin this cush and I'm high
The movie shit I'm livin'
These niggaz are to survive
We're above this Chevy, lend me a 65, lend me a 64
Yeah I know this , this light is new
See we're comin' thru
I'm gonna hit my top down
Haters gonna hate me now
Cause me and my niggaz are not crowned
When you niggaz are not around
Smokin' all that shit
We're talkin' for a life
We know since I was a kid
They know I'm fucking their bitch
They know I'm rollin' no ribs
They know I wanna get in
You know why I don't fuck with them
But I got to be steady when I get in
You think you got it, but you really don't got shit
You be hatin' because she hopin' on this dick
We gonna get high tonight
Most niggaz hate about the shit they can't control
But I'm laid back smokin' on this dro
We gonna get high tonight
They were afraid and you can tell it by the feelings
They fuck it
I got to keep it on my own shit
And people smoke it
Like I'm high tonight


Verse 1:
Jump up and down if you love the sound
We rip and rock until we tear shit down
Rip rock stands for hip hop mixed with rock and roll
I'm hardcore to my inner soul
Hold on as I swerve outta control
Directly into the unknowns of a black hole
All my real niggas with fucked up neurotransmitters
Wavin' glocks and swastikas
I'ma take 40 shots of this hard liquor and swigga
'Till I'm drunk as the Pississippi River
Even though I know the shit is fuckin' up my liver
Tomorrow when I wake up, I won't even remember
How I got home
Or where I got this tattoo of a mic on my arm from
Or when I hit them bitches last night
I shoulda used a condom (I guess not)
Now that's what I call rip-rock
Rip-rock (Repeated)
Chorus (x2)
You want rock and roll? (We got it)
You want hip-hop? (We got it)
You want to wreck shop? (We got it)
We got it, got it, we got it, got it, got it
Verse 2
Yo, I want you to sucker-punch
Whoever you standin' next to
If you ready to rock with a Refugee rebel
A Navy Seal underwater in a submarine vessel
Shittin' on niggas above sea-level
I'm tired of you emcees talking 'bout loot
I'm tired of you corny drug-induced rap groups
I'm tired of the lies, the cries, the screams
Tired of gettin' my name misspelled in magazines
I'm tired of you two-faced disc jockeys
Non-believers, suckin' on my arch enemy's penis
You know who you are, I'm talkin' to you
You need to recognize
I'm tryin' to introduce somethin' new
Somethin' I would sacrifice my life or die for
Somethin' if I was already dead I would rise for
Somethin' that would make a fool
A hundred times wiser
Somethin' that would help all mankind to prosper
I'd die with laughter
Lookin' at you wack emcees
With your craft unmastered, bastards
Hip-hop in it's rarest form
Crossbreeded with rock and roll
Now rip-rock is born, mother fuckers
Rip-rock (7x)
You want rock and roll? We got it
You want hip hop? We got it
You want to wreck shop? We got it
We got it, got it, we got it, got it, got it
You want rock and roll? We got it
You want hip hop? We got it
You want to wreck shop? We got it
We got it, got it, we got it, got it, got it
c'mon (echo) (3x)
Yeah!
c'mon (echo) (3x)
Yeah!
Rip Rock!

Verse one: bushwick bill
I told you size wasn't shit
That's why I murdered your neices
Wasn't my fault they found they head cut in 88 pieces
Don't let 'em run
Hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm I grab an arm let's pull 'till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked
Means you're better off dead
I wanna see food so I fished in a child's head
Motherfuckers be worried 'cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs
Mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th
The night of the living dead
? ? ? ? ? ? walkin' 'round givin niggas head
If you didn't die, I'd say you got lucky
All bodies found dead
Fuck it, blame it on chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!!!
Verse 2:
Aw fuck, chuck's on a killin' spree!
Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin me!
When I murder, I tried to slack off
Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain!
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back!
A murder contest,
You know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin hungry
I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs!
Bustin' necks with a motherfuckin' brick!
Half my body is chuckie
The other half is bushwick
A short nigga
Always pumpin' some lead
Haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up
Get up
Sit up
You get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a uzi is my only utensils
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to try to go against chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you
How the fuck you gonna duck?
Yo,
When I'm mad, I'm ready to slay
The graveyards are packed
But it ain't nothin' but child's play
Verse 3:
You'd better murder me
Put me to rest
Cause if you don't I'll come out shootin
With my head in a bird's chest
Pissed off,
The way I'm always soundin'
Killed a punk in '82, and they just now found 'I'm
Some say I'm crazy
Some say I'm on crack
Before I die
Cut off my leg and let me die in iraq
A born loooser
Some say I'm mindless
If I get pissed off
You leave naked and spineless
Worse than charles manson
Never havin' a equal
Went sleepwalkin' last night and killed 300 people
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
When they told me what I did I killed 300 more
Yo
You wanna rumble?
Then go get your war hat
I went to jail for assault with a carjack
I might be small
But my nuts are big
The worst that you could do is let me keep your fuckin kids
Cause I'm a teach 'em how to act
And if they ain't actin' right
They dyin' tonight!
So, uh
Ain't no use in you tryin' to spot 'em
I send you a motherfuckin note that says "chuckie's got em!"

(Handwriting's on the wall)
Yeah, it's on the wall
I'ma keep drinking til they toss me out this motherf*cker man
[Verse 1]
Excuse my tone of voice but today was just a bad day
Label hit me about another single and said I ain't had play
Since Country Sh*t, hell they thought that was a regional record anyway
But thank God for Bun B and Ludacris because they had faith
That sh*t would take off and it did, guess I was too country to quit
I make albums not hits, these rich folks don't know about this
But that's cool, I'm back to that K.R.I.T. Wuz Here
Pray to God this was meant for me, a king to be
Hoping my time was near
Maybe I'm rapping in vain, maybe this wasn't my lane
Maybe I'm hurting myself, talking 'bout real life instead of the fame
How can I change? Shawty I swear I think I'm wasting time
On the phone with my pops like, "I just wanna save some lives"
I just want a deuce to ride with the ones I was dealt
My pride might be my downfall, but I ain't asking for help
I wear my heart on my sleeve, don't run into me cuz it bleeds
No disrespect to your craft, but I make my own beats
Sh*t the handwriting.
(The handwriting's on the wall...)
Man the Hennessy do something to a n*gga man sometimes that sh*t...
I just can't hold back, you feel me?
[Verse 2]
First quarter got me like boiling water with soda in it
Drop my project in the pot watch it lock up like those in prison
Gotta prove these people wrong that don't see the vision
Three nominations, number one on 106, hell I forgot to mention
Two free albums minus label support
Fired my publicist cuz I forgot what I was paying him for
Drunk til I'm barely conscious,
call Johnny tell him put y'all on 3-way immediately
Cuz I'm sick of being lied to and I'm waging war
Then I'm going back to Sippi-land and I'm quitting rap
Ain't that bad cuz when I was poor, hell I was fat and happy
Dealing with the critics and the comments got me trippin'
Like my accent and my tone make it really hard to listen
I was scarred but I was driven before the politics came
Lynching rappers and dropping albums, and watching em hang
I pushed mine back with fear that they might just do me the same
Cuz I rebel I might get shelved, but that's part of the game
Hell, the handwriting...
(The handwriting's on the wall...)
Goddamn right it's on the wall
I take this sh*t seriously man
This is my life, this all I've ever known
This all I'll ever do and I promise to God I won't
let nobody take it from me
[Verse 3]
I did it for all of mine and all of yours
Ten toes deep in the game I'm in
I'm bound to lose if I'm living in sin
If I play to win will I make it out?
I'm tired of feeling my heart Lord I just wanna scrape it out
This the road less traveled, sh*t I just gotta stay the route
I hear the hate and all the betrayal I just gotta phase it out
With another shot, better chase it down with a glass of Crown
Put that on my tab, yeah I'm doing bad
Cuz music's all I've ever known, sh*t, all I've ever had
Tryna say something, tryna do something, tryna be better
Ain't much time left, I gotta make do, I can't live forever
Ain't that what makes me me? No smoke and no mirrors
And I don't even wear Loc's, so they can see me clear
And you can say that I'm bitter but tell me if I'm trippin'
They stick their noses up and talk down on Mississippi
Imagine how you'd feel to know you work hard, and you educated
And they treat you like you never made it
The handwriting...
(The handwriting's on the wall, final curtain's about to fall
Just ain't no feelings left at all,
the handwriting, handwriting's on the wall)

It's not a put down
I put my foot down
And then I make some love, I put my root down
Like Sweetie Pie by the Stone Alliance
Everybody knows I'm known for dropping science
I'm electric like Dick Hyman
I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So Mike, get on the mic and turn it out
We're talking root down, I put my root down
And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down
I said root down, it's time to scoot down
I'm a step up to the mic in my goose down
Come up representing from the upper west
Money makin' putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Because I'm doing what I want so I never rest
Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the Fruit of the Loom guys
Just strutting like the Meters with the Look-Ka Py Py
'Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is falling, then I'm gone
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
But we kick it from the root when we break it on down
Jimmy smith is my man, I want to give him a pound
I kick it root down
I put my root down
I kick it root down
I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down

AdRock don't stop, get on the mic with the tic and the toc
I'll fill you with the fuckin' rim like brim
I'm walking down your block and you say that's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound
The Beastie Boys you know we come to get down
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
And say oh my God, that's the funky shit
So I'm going to pass the mic and 'cause a panic
The original nasal kid is doing damage
Every morning I took the train to high street station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
Like Harlem world battles on the Zulu beat show
It's Kool Moe D vs. Busy Bee there's one you should know
Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due
M.C.A. grab the mic and the Ma Bell will connect you
Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
"If dancin' prays to the lord then I shall feel alright"
It feels to play a little music
Tears running down my face 'cause I love to do it
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master in disaster with a sound that's gone
I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom
For bringing me into this world and so on
I kick it root down
I put my root down
I kick it root down
I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it?

Yeah, that shit's on down
And that's a record, that's a record 'cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record 'cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record to Mario
Awww, now that's a record, buddy

Did my time in a county jail just when
Just when things started goin' well
And I paid the price for the crimes I did
Wanna change my life, wanna raise my kids
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?
I do the damn thing, bezel and the damn bling
Sling grams, spend 10 grand on a damn ring
I run Philly, I ain't tryin' to be the damn king
But the damn thing could get pulled like a hamstring
I used to hang with these niggas from my hood man
Yeah, I showed them the world, I took 'em out the hood man
Yeah, it cost some change but it's all good man
'Cause I got money to burn like backwoods man
And we was smokin', jokin' and poppin' bottles
Gettin' open, strokin', pokin' and poppin' models
I was hopin', that they could get paper with me
But when I started gettin' cake they started hatin' on me
They showed up to the crib that my mother was at
My son, my baby mother and my brother was at
And they was strapped, actin' tough and started bustin' they gat
To protect my family I started bustin' it back
I'm an innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?
Jail vicious, it's hard to be patient and stay strong
When you get pictures of chicks half naked in they thongs
The anticipation be makin' the days long
I waited 'cause I just gotta make it like Trey Songz
My lawyers couldn't lose, they proved the D.A. wrong
I smiled at the trial, kept cool and stayed calm
I waved at my mom and swallowed my pride man
Them guys on the stand brought tears to my eyes man
The stuff they was discussin' was nothin' but lies man
They said I bust the chrome at homie that died man
I thought them lil' dudes was part of my squad man
'Til they started actin' up but they must've been high man
You see that I ain't shook from the look in my eyes man
But bein' booked was a blessin' in disguise man
I needed time to get my life organized man
So everythin' that happened was part of my God's plan, understand?
I'm an innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?
Involuntary manslaughter, just parole
I spanked the murder like a bad ass 6 year old
I knew that I was gon' be rich since I was 6 years old
Now I'm the richest rapper under 26 years old
So it's on now, I'm home now, it's a celebration
I got my drink and my 2 step 'cause I'm elevatin'
I'm gettin' hella cake and with the number 1 record
But I'll still bust my gun if you come test it
Change the life that I, that I live
Got me livin' fine, livin' negative
Need to leave the game that is destroyin' me
So I pray to God that He has mercy
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man

The life of a player, ain't no simple task
Best believe you gotta watch yo' ass
'Cause niggas and bitches stay on yo' shit
Just waitin' for a nigga to hit
But a player like me got my own game plan
And that's why I keep the upper hand
And this is the reason why I sell this
To keep you motherfuckers jealous
They can't cope with a nigga like me
Tha D - the motherfuckin' G
Now won't you come and catch a grip
And bitch, get my dick off your lip
And tell your niggas to get back
Before somethin' happenin'
Like you gettin' pimp slapped
Thinkin' of a true star
You'll come out with P-L-A-Y-E-R
The Player...
The life of a player
Straight out the money, bail to the bank
The upper high class where a nigga rank
And people always try to say they feelin' it
Then wanna come with the bullshit
I don't wanna deal with a bitch on a get-rich-quick plan
Tryin' to make a player be her man
And the niggas on the nut jock roll
Bein' a ho for a player
They might as well be on a stroll
Bring the 'K back a fat end
Just so they could be my friend
I don't accept it, I'll look you over then check it
There's another nigga who feels neglected
The punk and the bitch in a broke role
Will I ever go back to? (Hell nah)
I think I'll stick to the lick that got me rich
Slangin' this dick - the life of a player...
"An old, off the street pimps con game"
Bitches, niggas, the whole nine yards
Try to search for the play on the boulevard
The coolest nigga on the scene
Now he live his life like a king
He never rolls undercover
'Cause yo, he's a bad motherfucker
Thinkin' of jackin' my friends
Hmmm, you better think again nigga
See few have only been chosen
But this young player has rosen
With a different bitch every night
Bitches give up the pussy because they don't like to fight
And when he's done they remember the door
'Cause they know they gotta go
He'll do ya know and see ya later
That's right bitch, this is the life of a player...

[Slug]
Shrapnel...
I can't remember who asked me, but someone asked me
How long I thought that I would be allowed atop this trash heap
I didn't answer cause I'm tired of criticizing the masses
Inspired the support the devouring of the self
All the power to the people who dig potholes
Placed me in a glass case full of lost treasures and fossils
Got a right to be hostile, my love is gettin' gang raped
By an army full money hungry crocodiles
Quantity is up, market in a flood
But the party over here has never steered through this much love
I'll take the laughter, but I'd rather have the women
Who am I kiddin'? I'll be content with whatever I'm givin'
Work for food, rent, sex, money, or water
I don't know what else that you have to offer
Your first born daughter? No need, already got her
She came to the set hungry and left hot and bothered
My posse's full of women, computer nerds, and thugs
Much to my dismay, I'm none of the above.
Someday I'ma be the mack of the minute
And you were so damn good I'ma have to forget it
Listen to the mimic, it's almost on
Drink, till ya hit me with a tall potion
Think quick, how much more insult
Will it take for me to break your light bulb
Shrapnel...
[Chorus x2]
Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain(?)
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel
[Slug]
Check your mail, climb your ladder
Count the pieces you've managed to gather
Does it matter? What are you trying to achieve?
Let go of your throat if you're dying to breathe
And finally we've begun to make a little progress
Ain't a single dock in this river that can stop us
Lost in the mix like a feeble(?) over dub
Got me screaming at these shippin' till these people know what's up
Yeah Slug's back, but his collection of hub caps
Caught a buzzin' brought a notebook full of love raps
Open the pipes and tuck that voice in
I'ma sit on this corner and nibble on my poison
Baby once in awhile I find a reason to smile
But most the time it's spent deep in denial
It's all make believe, I want the cake to eat
But this lake's too deep, tryin' to stand on two feet
Wonderin' about the thunder runnin' through this blood
I try to keep my cool, but the hat fits too snug
Study the love, took my degree
Shoved it into a bottle, chucked it into the sea
Shrapnel...
[Chorus x2]
Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel
Shrapnel...
[Chorus x4]
Shards of pull cards scattered on the carpet
It's hard to breathe cause you wear a fitted target
Tug upon a choke chain, travel the cold rain
Of course I've came to show you shrapnel
Shrapnel...[repeated to end]
I am not ugly [reversed]

Fifteen will get ya twenty
Sixteen will get ya ten
Don't think it can't happen to you cause
It happened to one of my friends
Eighteen fresh out of school
Doin' the right thing playing by the rues but
One day she caught his eye thirty six, twenty four with
A skirt size five. He stepped to and
Asked her name mot ever thinking to
Ask her age she so fine she had
To be grown had he known then what
He knows now.
She was only beauty queen, man oh man how
Could this be so damn fly but only sixteen
Fifteen get ya twenty, sixteen get you ten don't
Think it can't happen to you cause
It happened to one of my friends
Let me tell you about my friend
1997 homecoming queen working hard
On her degree but one hot day she was
Out at the Greek and there he was about
Five foot nine chocolate as cocoa in the middle of
July so fine. He had to be grow
Had she knew then what she knows now.
He was only sixteen with the body of a god and
A face of a king man oh man how could this be
So damn fly but only sixteen

Squirrels,
All we really are is Squirrels,
We're being hunted we are Squirrels,
We are appealing we are Squirrels,
We want to gather nuts,
But, people splatter our guts,
When they're on a country drive,
It isn't easy to survive,
Just the other day,
I saw a squirrel get blown away,
They served him on a dinner tray,
They baked him into a souffle,
Squirrel season opens up today,
If you're a squirrel run away,
I don't know what else I should say,
Please call the A.S.P.C.A.
Fur coats from us are made,
Fur is nice but, I like suede,
They scrape our fur off with a blade,
And never bother with first aid,
We squirrels really like to play,
And we like to catch some rays,
Please don't kill us this we pray,
We're cute and harmless anyway,
Squirrels!,
We're not delicious,
Squirrels!,
We are not racoons,
Squirrels!,
Don't live in palm trees,
Squirrels!,
are in your bathrooms!
Squirrels!,
That's all we really are is squirrels,
Isn't it fine I am a squirrel,
Please help us save us,
We are squirrels!,
I wanna whip out my, squirrel!
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
Squirrels!,
SQUIRRELS!

I'mma lil mannish muthafucka
I take out them older brothas
Started out sellin' marijauna
But now I'm sellin' yola
Shit was gettin' hella funky at first
When a nigga was snatchin' up bitches purse
Ended up gettin' kicked up outta school in Vallejo
They clocked me like a circus
(Like a circus?)
I was the 'lil mannish mufucka showin' out in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me witta switch and I'd say that hurts
Get to the house, start some shit and start some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
'Cause I be movin' fast and I be tryin'na stash
Beat up the pizza man and I straight dash
Disobedient sports cut my days short
My mama got tired of takin' my ass back and forth to court
I said momma I'mma straighten up for you and I promise that I'mma work
Got me a job as a paper boy, 21 dollars a month
5 o'clock in the morning, damn I'm slavin' for the fuckin' white man
21 dollars might buy me some porage call me chicken George
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin' over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me, I was tired of being broke lookin' tore down
I came up off a twenty dollar break me down
Next thang you know, I was up to about a quarter of a key ballin'
Niggaz wuz trippin' off me cause I was a young muthafucka ballin'
Gettin' my fetti on but when it was funk I had to stall
Time to go get them choppers and bring out the u-haul
I'm extra mannish-I make ya vanish-I play for keeps
Investigate that ass till I find out where you sleep
Muthafucka, I'm Kamikaze-don't even try me I
Bars nuttin', best believe that I'mma bring the uh
Fully automatic tommy with the info red and say I'm sorry
Before I pump yo ass fulla lead and dump the body
"Extra mannish" thats what people be callin' me
Oh we can be cool until you gets to threatenin' me
I lose my temper and shit, my eyes turn red
Blow my top and get real hot at the head
I guess I'mma failure, I got no future in my frontin'
All I'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
Don't ask me why? Sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Rebuke the devil, I gotta get up out the ghetto free
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy was ever payin' me
Who would ever think that a nigga like me
Would become such a bad ass youngster?
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why didn't I wait till I was bigger, before I started drinkin' malt liquor?
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn 'lil mannish ass nigga
Guess who comes thru
(who?)
Its me the Y O U N G M U T Z
I'm just as mannish as I wanna be I pack a 30-30
Niggaz wanna blast me because I'm down and dirty
Extra mannish is how I'm livin' and I'm fuckin' my neighbors bitch and
She's lovin' every minute of the dick that I be givin'
Bitches on my jock bitches on my jock
Niggaz on the block know I got a glock
Bean cocks, Pecos, and all that
I'm beatin niggaz down witta baseball bat
I'm not the revenues, I'm gettin' paid fool
A ghetto muthafucka witta attitude
S I C K W I T I T
It's Young Mutz and E-40
This explains why its hard for us blacks and Hispanics
And why we turn extra mannish

Snoop (daz):
Yeah, what i'ma do right here is take my time,
And dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace,
And my niggas behind the wall.
See you when I get there, you know what I'm saying? (really doe)
So drip with me as I go down memory lane.
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener,
(1-8-7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor).
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up,
Some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed.
But it's a east side thang, a hoo ride thang,
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang).
I bring you the motherf**king .38,
(just get the mc and the homie nate).
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide,
As I take you on a trip nigga ride (east side).
Nate (daz):
Do you remember back on the east side?
Where all us niggas used to love to ride.
We didn't care what we did,
Time was nothing to us we were just kids.
Times are different now, but you still get stuck,
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a f**k.
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me,
Keep this in mind: I'm a motherf**king o.g.
Snoop:
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time,
June 17th, 1979.
That's my first time being arrested,
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit.
I learned than from the g's,
A g is an overseer, the overseer sees.
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced,
And besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent.
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home,
My momma's going to get me, and I flee with (? ).
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb,
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones.
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done,
She said: "playing football should be your only fun son".
I'm like "allright" so we enter the house,
Come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth.
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch,
I looked at my momma and said: "damn, why you snitch? "
They put me on punishment but that didn't work,
Now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a t-shirt.
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides,
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time.
Nate:
My homie told me one day he had a jack move,
He said: "come on nate dogg, it'll be smooth".
I agreed and said "come on, let's go and jack them fools",
Next day we were draped in the county blues.
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years),
Saying to myself "i'll never f**k with that nigga again".
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be
What I am now and that's a motherf**king o.g.
Original gangsta
Daz:
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials,
Never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile.
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an o.g.,
Beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some hillfigers.
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies,
With the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me.
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me,
Because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more.
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door,
To let you know we can't take no more.
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends,
And let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost.
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair,
And ask myself: "who the f**k should I really fear? ".
I ran around with the best killers,
Thug criminals and drug dealers.
Blasting niggas if they come near us,
(? ) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could.
Knock on wood for good luck,
Serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck.
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack,
A grown child laying niggas the f**k down.
Nate (daz):
Original gangsta (original gangsta),
Coming from long beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me).
Coming from the east side...
You're f**king with the pound, oh nigga please,
C-o-b.'s can't see the d-o-double g's, [o.g.'s... repeat 5 times]
Shout outs to my nigga mr. d-a-z,
Shout outs to my nigga mr. warren g,
Shout outs to my nigga s-n-double o-p,
Shout outs to my niggas c, style and me.
Snoop (nate):
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story.
You know what I'm saying? it's a g thang baby (original gangsta)
You trick ass bitch!

Yo, uhh
Ohh, huh, that's how it's goin down huh?

When it comes to that flow (YO!) I gets busy
Dog don't care get, bear like grizzly
Boom boom boom! ATF, who the fuck is he?
Dog is the nigga that's gon' walk through the night
Park the car twenty blocks away and walk to the fight (WHAT?!)
And go where the fuck I want cause New York is alright
The dog is alright, if the hawk is on sight
Everything from "Get at Me Dog" to "What's My Name?" (woo!)
X got a rep, niggaz trust my name
Ain't never been a nigga to discuss my fame (WHAT?!)
Fuck my fame, nigga, what's my name? (WHAT?!)
I'ma keep it real no matter what it cost me
Never one to be taken lightly or softly
Dog, I don't know you please back the fuck up off me
Before I have him, 'cause I popped you tryin to off me
[Chorus 2X: DMX]
So don't walk too fast or talk too much
Cause y'all niggaz is ass, and you know whassup
Cause y'all niggaz'll blast and we like WHAT?!
And my niggaz'll blast and Y'ALL FUCKED UP!
[DMX]
I done told you niggaz to walk with me, and stand
Now who's lookin at me, akwardly? My man
But you know who I let talk to me? My fans
Take pictures shake hands cause, that's my man
It'll be what it is for as long as I let it last
Shit niggaz put out? I'd be wrong if I let it past
Think that shit is hot bitch, just because you said it fast? (WHAT?!)
I'm about to dead it fast, you pumped off unleaded gas (c'mon!)
Don't keep goin where you're goin it's a dead end
'fore a nigga catch you at the door tryin to get it
Key tryin to fit in, fo'-pound spittin
Get what you put in (WHAT?!) bullshit forbidden (WHAT?!)
Stop talkin wreckless, cause - y'all don't mean it (woo!)
y'all better respect this, cause - y'all don't seen it (woo!)
y'all better check this cause I'm gon' bring it
Bring it? I don't think y'all really want to see it!
[Chorus]
[DMX]
Aiyyo why do niggaz run they mouth, when they ain't bout it? (uh-huh)
Ain't "Ryde or Die" but, stay wantin to shout it (uh-huh)
Stay pullin the thing out but what you gon' do without it?
No, I want to know f'real, what you gon' do without it? (f'real!)
We done tested y'all niggaz, the rest of y'all niggaz
Threatened y'all niggaz, STRAIGHT UP, double vested y'all niggaz
And it was ONLY out of love that we protect y'all niggaz
And because of a nigga in jail, we respected y'all niggaz
But
[Chorus - 1/2]
[DMX]
Be careful where you walkin cause the ground's real shaky
Nigga hold the fo' but PLEASE don't make me
Please don't mistake me, make me, angry (WHAT?!)
Love me or hate me (WHAT?!) niggaz can't break me (c'mon!)
[Chorus - 2X]

[Chorus]
Black Monday
That's what this joint is all about
Black Monday
A million men strong without a doubt
Black Monday
It's not just a role that one plays
Black Monday
So we can have justice one day
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday
Hey Yo, be, I thougt we conquered the world
When a million men came and shined like a
Black pearl
This time there was no black on black crime
'Cause everybody was thinkin' of ways that pays for
The black mind
One & equal
Not thinkin' of wealth
But knowledge of self
So the past won't repeat like a sequel
Visions of unity
Strong in the community
The same song sung for diplomatic immunity
Is soon to be reality
Not just a formality, an actuality
Built strong by our morality
Can you see what I can see
One force that be lettin' me be what I be
Without costing me members of my family tree
One man can stand for all
But who got his back when he fall
Yo, I had a dream that one day
One million men stood strong and we called it
Black Monday
Black Monday
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday
By now we all know that some wrongs have
Been committed
So be wise, organize my man
Yo, you with it?
Let's have the courage to stand up and speak out
Reach out and help out
No doubt
See we can actually make a difference
The politicians got game, but I say who are
They kiddin'
Seriously, we gotta get our own thing tight
'Cause we ain't even learned
To treat our own peeps right
You don't have to be a scholar to acknowledge
You shouldn't harm your own just 'cause your
Fiendin' for dollars
That's messed up, so fess up
It's good for the soul
Repent
Change your ways
Exhibit more self control
We must be willin' to stop the killin'
'Cause if not
We'll destroy what our forefathers were building
Step up
Do something
It's your duty and purpose
All the material pleasures ultimately are worthless
Curses
They are not needed to explain that
You will wreck your brain
If you do not maintain
Reconciliation, restoration and resolution
Atonement
Completion of perfect union
Black Monday
[Chorus]

I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that i can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor, i suggest you stay fair with me
Been payin dues for a decade plus,
Before that i was just another face on the bus
Tappin my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreamin 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom, i promise im gonna be large
Someday im gonna stop tryin to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, its just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didnt hear, fuck whatevers heard
I think you got the sickness i suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix, of a bottle full of fix
Im gonna hobble down the street 'til i reach knob creek
Its not that i dont like you, i just dont wanna speak
You fuckin freak
Now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever youve added and subtracted
Im pushin on the hammer, to trigger the brain
Embrace how i live it, god loves ugly
[chorus]
God loves ugly...
Once upon a time in minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage, who is it?
My names slug ive come to kill a couple minutes
Whats up with the way, that everybody gathers around each other
So they can steal each others sound
If its all about gettin down with the get down
How long i gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when youre standing in a storm
Abandoning the norm, and handling the harvest
Measuring the worth by the depth of the hardships
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held on to the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin short on rations
I began tappin the egg, to spark the hatchin
Make it happen
And take this captain to the gallows
I keep steerin us into an area thats shallow
Talkin to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
He said i should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
Im gonna creep through the night
And put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows
And the dam starts to overflow
Ill float atop the flood, holding on to my ugly
[chorus]

Yeah, Webby, it's that shit you just roll to
You know what I'm sayin'?
Hop in the whip... and roll.
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
And I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart aint nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
But I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
And I roll I roll
Still like a kid but I'm newly 22 though
They know me as the chew from CT to Pluto
Walk around town everybody givin' kudos.
Michael Cera didn't hit it I'm the one who banged Juno.
I live life mucho, bueno, smash coolo
Shows every week since I linked up with New York,
Now I'm on that new flow doin' what I do bro
Buzz gettin bigger than an uncut jew frow.
Who knows, I would achieve on this level
And prove my teachers wrong cause they said I was a rebel,
Who never would amount to nothing doin' what I want
Always showin' up to class smellin' like a fresh blunt.
But I always had it in me I just needed to apply myself
And rap's all I've ever loved besides myself.
Ha, maybe I'm a little cocky dude but if you spit this tight
Then you'd be cocky too.
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
And I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart aint nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
But I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
And I roll I roll
I roll, roll like a Michelin, everyday I get it in
Pop another Ridalin, listen in,
I was a goofball never the sober guy,
Gettin' high rollin' up, J's playin Golden Eye,
Star fox in a ship facing Andross,
Zelda, Gannondorf in a standoff,
Battlin' with Bowser fireball flower
Sittin' in front of my TV for hours,
And though you grow up you still hang on to the past
Being young was a blast and you clean up your act
And try to make somethin' of it, don't listen to the haters
And if you got a passion, then you follow it if you love it
That's what I did and shit I'm alright
Still livin with my parents but I'm livin' the life
I'll be wakin' up late and I'll party all night
Cause I'm doin' what I love and the future looks bright
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
And I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart aint nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
But I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
And I roll I roll
You can find me eatin' bacon grilled cheese with my grape juice,
Donkey Kong in the flesh like that ape loose,
Yeah that's f*ckin' right, I could snuff a mic
Since I rode my dirty black and white rusted huffy bike,
Soon enough I'm in a two door drop
With a stack of money greener then a newport box.
So I dare you to go and find a dude more hot
Buzzin' CT so big I made New York watch
Now everybody be recitin' all my raspy quotes
Of the skinny white boy with a scratchy throat
Now my mix-tapes, everybody has it,
Cuz in your iTunes got more Web than your attic does
Get it? Just nod if you follow me,
You don't gotta like it, but if not just acknowledge me
I got an army of ninjas across the US
And I'm just doin' what I do best
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
And I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart aint nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack.
But I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that
And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap
And I roll I roll

The bronx making them records cause we always prepared

Violator motherfucker
[Mysonne]
Yo, yo

Y'all give me sixteen yo I'll tear this whole city up
And niggas don't believe then tell em put fifty up
All bets is down, all my thugs do dirt, all our tecs spit rounds
My ? playas disrespected clowns
Bringing guns, weed and coke to connected towns
See I pop niggas like corn, and real killers do killings wit the lights on
I knock em out, cause I don't like to fight long
Remember me lefty gun up in my right palm
It's mysonne, see mysonne is the one that knock on your door
You open up, you see a whore wit the glock to your jaw
See mysonne is the one that hit the blocks wit the raw
For his money, mysonne air the block wit the four
Y'all cowards don't want war, yy'all can't stand pain
Cop you some gators, drink champagne
'Cause when it comes to the street shit, I let the heat lift
Murder scene police lines nigga white sheet shit
Y'all roll wit niggas, I'm the one they roll wit
Y'all go get niggas, I'm the one they go get
Y'all niggas don't want nothing to do wit me
'Cause I spit guns and rhymes like their's two of me
Motherfucker
[Prodigy]
Niggas can't be serious, we wear guns like clothes
But only show em when it's time to blow em in bulk
We been through way worse then war, razor fights and more
Left niggas wit leaks, holes and wide jaw
Be the quiet storm, appear how you want to scale bar
Check out your weight, see if it's worth to war
We did the street life y'all niggas just got involved
My appetite for guns is similar to carnivores
Dislike me you head on, fight me you dead wrong
'Cause now a days you only get wet wit my dead on
Don't let this song push you, the fourth hit you
Have you keyed up gasping for breath on the floor cripple
Infamous we take it to the extremes my words
Especially when a nigga mistake me for herb
Get buried over words, I'm loose wit the dessy bird
I can show ready or tell, y'all niggas heard
[busta rhymes]
Now gitty up now, it's lighting horse back saddling
Rob beaches like we rowing a boat and we paddling
Down a stream of water, wet any nigga challenging
Blow one all in your knee cap leave you staggering
Scrambling cause theirs a whole lot of shit we be handling
My hands all in the money, fuck it we dibble and dabbling
Got you imaging how this could really all be happening
My landscape of live niggas stretch from here to Maryland
Blaw put one in a nigga who be rambling
And blow a hundred thou if y'all niggas is really gambling
Gritty niggas feel the snap pop leaving it crackling
You know the bouncer keep all of my live niggas wild wit him
Traveling to see niggas from Howard through grambling
Ha round up my niggas to form a large gathering
Yo rattling niggas who walk bad limp
Beat you in the same place till the blues start blacking
CEO niggas stay general managing
Flipmode throwing those heavy bundles we carrying
Yo analyze my many live niggas cramming it
We throw a three pointer, while y'all niggas throwing javelins
Sweating your whole shit, feel your clothes damping
Dancing in a line of four wheel drives we lamping
The [unknown] arms length up in the draw paneling
Or unraveling the truth on how niggas remain champions
Ha, ha, ha
[Busta rhymes]
Flipmode, violator, we always silence shit
Fuck is wrong wit y'all
Cut that shit off now
Cut it off nigga
Cut it off nigga

[Sauce Money]
(*Laughing*) Brooklyn
This is the set-off
Kay Sleezy
Take it to the streets nigga
Word up
Sauce Money
Uh, uh
Proper set-off
Don't get it fucked up 'cause Sauce calm wit his grandma
'cause I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
'cause like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
'cause bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip
[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot glock
Blaaat!
[Bun B]
They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
VA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me "Your Highness"
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
'cause we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
'cause the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
'cause my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, glocks and lugers
AK's, are 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...
[WC]
Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, 'cause lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly
'cause this'll leave your teflon holey
With the forty glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene
It's the Ghetto Heisman and the Drama King
[Joe Buddens]
It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!
[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year
(*Gunshots*)

[Verse 1:]
Tell me what should I do, what should I say.
I'm lost for words so I'm coming to you, sistas.
Will you help me, see I don't know, where to start, to find the keys to win over a woman's heart.
Well first, things to remember when your game comes into play.
Gain your composure show respect and you'll be okay, because the ladies really like it when.
When you don't succeed, don't get offended.
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend.
[Chorus:]
Ooh ooh ooh. I like that girl. [2x]
Yeah she says that she like you, too, but she's too shy come and talk to you so.
Boy, you have to make that move if you want her to be yours.
[Verse 2:]
Show me a man that will be me, love.
Love me for me.
I'm not asking much.
See true love don't come easily and if it's meant to be, it happens natuarlly.
If you don't look for love, it might actually find you.
Now tell me what you want, what you need.
Cause I be thinking ya'll be bout diamonds, pretty necklaces nice cars, bling bling.
I thought ya'll made it clear, love don't' cost a thing.
Tell me if I'm wrong or right.
I don't want to make the same mistake I made before, she walked out the door cause her love I ignored.
I just want to take my time and explore her world cause, truth be told, I really like this girl.
[Chorus]
Now it don't matter the size of your bankroll.
Cause I'm an independent women, I can take care of my own.
I don't care bout your escalade or your sprees sitting on chrome.
Cause when it comes to a woman, you need a girl that you can take home.
[Last chorus:]
Ooh ooh ooh I like that girl. [2x]
You know, mommy, you're the best thing I ever seen come round my way and i.
Want you to be down with me like I'm with you, yes, you, girl.
You know you drive me crazy.
Ooh ooh yeah.
You got me saying, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me going, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me singing, ooh ooh yeah.
I'm feeling everything ya'll been talking bout.
And for her it's time for me to kick the player out.
With no doubt it's been running through my mind.
Settling down, true love I have found, my world she's forever my sunshine.
My pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, see, love is not about the material. but it's mental heartfelt
And spiritual.
I like that girl yeah [4x]

[Chorus: Ellie]
Where do I begin
To tell you all the things I feel when you're with me?
The day we met I knew I'd fall so easily
You must believe you're givin' everything I need
Never to much..
[Ghostface Killah]
Snatched the Princess
Tricks keep searchin for the glass slipper
The first time the brides maid zipped the zipper
Then walked down the aisle, look at little pretty Roxanne's smile
That's right, she big head child
Spot the glass on the hand, white valor laying across the floor
Draggin' damn, she got a good man
Family in the back, one half on both sides of the church
Look at Keisha in the tight ass skirt
Mom Duke in the front row, Grandma Pearl sittin right next our row
Beside Uncle Joe, then right before her eyes
The preacher ask, "Would it to death do you part if one dies?"
She replies, "Yes", the winnin words that described best
Grandma pinned sittin 30 on the right breast
Now she searchin for the slob-down, the block's slick vitamin joint
Mad water in her eyes at this point
The man holdin the Bible announces, "You're married for life
Sign my cheque, peace to the bridal"
Recall this one girl's marriage, one girl's carriage
One with the lucky fingers, grab it, she attracted to magnet
She might have cracked the safe, seen the cabbage
Now it's one love in the tablet
[Chorus: Ellie]
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay
[C-Wiggs]
Cobra popped, a bottle of black Burgundy, coversated
I stared at your green eyes stagnated, your butter milk skin
You smelled good but you taste even better
Eye ball walk/talk was first on the agenda
I 'member the first time we engaged in the act, in the ac'
You jumped on my lap and pushed the seat back
Passionate thoughts, I knew you would be the wiz
Now you hold my kids, my divine little wiggs
The grand souflan cuz of your presence
So I'ma take it back to the essence just like Valentine presents
Long tongues and wet kisses, sex positions
Buy habista, siesta key, Florida visits
You exquisite young heart, I held you by afar, unchained
Our physical's 33 within the Range
Things have changed over the course of time
But you are mine, and I'm yours
I'm lookin forward to you after tours

[Intro]
Let that water cleanse yo' mind
Feel it tricklin down yo' spine
It's all about the wills and won'ts, do's and don'ts
and the price they'll pay to shine
[Bubba Sparxxx]
Now I done came a ways up this long road
In spite of the lies that y'all told
Believe me these folks is all cold
From the Polo Club to Paul doe
They all know Bubba ya boy who cut her without a rubber
But you couldn't look past my skin
So me and Ken wrote about the water
Now it's true I babble on about blotter and tales of beanstalks
But peep it it ain't no secret I'm reachin beyond that cheap talk
Cause we fought battles and this water make yo' trunk rattle
So if it's beef you searchin fo' I run with poachers who hunt cattle
And it don't matter, if you crunk in the club, or drunk in the pub
Bring that notion to my ocean boy you sunk in a sub
I'm crumblin buds of homegrown, ponderin shit that's gone wrong
But fuck it it ain't productive to dwell on somethin that's lone gone
My dome's blown, from twenty plus years of experimentin
with whatever drug you pedalin, from acid coke to heroin
But lately I've been settlin for liquor and herbal treats
I want the money, the hoes, and the house on Myrtle Beach
[Chorus]
Let that water cleanse yo' mind
Feel it tricklin down yo' spine
It's all about the wills and won'ts, do's and don'ts
and the price they'll pay to shine
Let that water cleanse yo' mind
I pray it opens up your eyes
Cause can't nobody call, tomorrow at all
So we live for the present time
[Bubba Sparxxx]
Next time you in the A-T-L get on 85 South and travel
sixty miles to Legrange, but watch yo' chrome off on that gravel
Then mount your horse and saddle cause you in the country now
The birthplace of Bubba 'kay now leave before the sun is down
It's funny how you look at us as nothin more than crumbs of dust
that's scattered on your wall when just like y'all in guns we trust
Run with us for bout a week, let us teach you how to speak
with this jazzy rural grammar to get them hoes up out they seat
Bouncin beats all down the street out them Buicks on chrome'n'blades
And even though it's Christmas day we still eatin on foamy plates
Ain't nuttin, we gon' be straight whether you accept us or decline us
I ain't Baby, Shan ain't Mannie - but I still feel we +Big Tymers+
Them classics all designers, unforgiven and livin
like today is forever cause tomorrow is for the vision
Based on optimism and honestly I can't see it
I'ma crank it up tonight if tomorrow comes so be it
[Chorus]
[Bubba Sparxxx]
Man I'm feelin day to day, on dope quotes
Ridin a boat that hope floats
With an entourage of po' folks
who smoke dope but don't cope
I swear to y'all I won't croak, before this dream is realized
No confederates in this settlement but trust me the South will rise
It ain't even about the rap shit, we already mastered that shit
All the water in this well's for country folks who never had shit
Did you know they closin down the only factory in this town?
But still you got the nerve to say it's plenty work to go around
I asked the Lord to hold me down 'til I find me some distribution
He kept me up for seven nights then finally hit me with this solution
As a result of this pollution it seems my water is now valued
at twenty dollars a jug, so yessir, we puttin it out soon
But in the form of loud tunes to soothe your troubled heart
What many call salvation is really just Bubba Sparxxx
So when I'm easin up them charts, say thank you cause this for y'all
Pay the price, live your life, and that money, get it all
[Chorus]
If you need to bathe, then bathe
And if you want to drink, come on and drink
from this well
[Chorus]
.. Bubba Sparxxx, huh, Big Shan, J.J., Southwestern Clay
.. Collabo, two geezy, huh, y'all hurtin for this
.. Huh, you need it, Bubba

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo!, Gas Mask down
It's revenge mode
I gotta level my levels
So I don't explode
Gotta stay focused
Put on the Killah face
Figure how to get em' all in the same place
Plot thickens, it's all about the strategies
I look down in my bag and see a stack of cheese
Start making calls, buying artillery
Landmines and shit, niggas is killing me
Aiming for the block where all the magic happens
Call 911 report a kidnapping...
[Verse 2: AZ]
Fuck a Glock
Hundred shots from the ooo-wop
Let's bring it back to them blocks off the new lots
Who a cop, nigga? I started from the shoe box
You grew a lot
But I schooled you how to do drops
In my tube socks spraying from the rooftops
92' props
Banging for my blue tops
It's me and you Ak , Biggie verses 2Pac
You forgot
I'm the one who let you rock
Yellow brick squares yeah
Nigga I'm the wiz here
Can never fear
Fuck boy you just live here
Kill your kids here, put you in a wheel chair
And leave you there with that ice grill stare Tony
You know you know me
The one and only
The ruler of Eukanuba
Do my dirt all by my lonely
Motherfucker
It's me nigga!
You know that work I put in!
You really feeling yourself!
Should've stayed gone, motherfucker!
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Raj came quick
Like he's suppose to
I'm going postal
Caught a gang member - Blew him bi-costal
Brains all over the block - it's hot
Crooked cops running up in the game to see my plot
They about to meet in the street where the bomb's set
Detonate like a war vet and jet
Duck behind cars, Blowing ARs
Glock 9s poppin, Bodies droppin'
I'm taking out knee caps - Anyone standin'
Perfect timing, Perfect plannin'
I'm filling funeral homes and graves
It's no surprise
GFK the only one to survive!
You know what I mean?
Cause when the real kids come at you, nigga it's over

As I expand.... you
[Iriscience]
Ay yo amplify, magnify, broaden my reach
Expand, exercise, ex-get increased
The 'e' and the 'x' are connected like excellence
The 'p' is for peoples that Dilated represents
(Evidence: A-N for all night) PM to AM
and D's for droppin rhymes with no delayin'
Even numb from Novacane you feel the slow pain
See flames but fuel the fire like propane
(Evidence: now hold that) keep that lock and less beats
War's not the word to play its like peace
I'm a cyborg connected with a mic in my hand
[Babu scratches]
As I expand... you know I am..am..
A... triple optometrist mental megalopolis...
A... student on these L.A. blocks...
Raakaa Iriscience rapid fire how I transmit
[Iriscience]
Ay yo me and Omega, Devious Doze used to pose
Hypothetical flows gettin' thrown with no foes
A decade ago- introduced to Will Copper
And out the other side of my fear- a field trooper
Son of a preacher- in school a student teacher
But I'd rather read or hit the theater for a double feature
Bored night creature well I used to trade books
When science appeared fellow scientists trade looks (y'all see that?)
A brick by brick builder I learned to mix mortar
Gettin' smarter and smarter from Homocide and Law and Order
Street poet, mild man or reporter
Til I flip like cool Kieth drippin' droppin' like water
[Babu scratches Dilated lines]
Raakaa Iriscience...create to devastate
Why wait... put your gloves out
Expand and dilate...
As I expand you know who I am...Its the expanding man...
A... triple optometrist mental megalopolis...
A... student on these L.A. blocks...
Iriscience...you know who I am...am
[Iriscience]
Now I haven't forgotten all the drugs that Bush brought in
Its funny how its maybe his stash your son got in
Man, Uncle Sam facilitated the plan
Got weed dealed in miligrams and grams and kilograms
(Evidence: Yo, word to our lye) they can heal a killa man
They might have a plant they can if they got a pill to can
Body upon young body into camps
but camps turn to pen when boys to turn to men
War bein' used to both profit and clense
War spoke- why it camouflage the feds
I'm a freedom fighter, reader, writer, rapper, and fan
[Babu scratching]
As I expand you know who I am...
You know who he is
As I expand you know who I am...
The expanding man...
As I expand you know who I am...am
As I expand you know who I am...
Its the expanding man

Piakhan floating on the mighty clouds of joy
Building a future, yo, for my baby boy (uh huh)
I moved form the hood yet the shit still in me
And your opinion is nothing to me
I have plenty like bein' out of prison
With a roof over my dome
And possessing the gift such as sparking the microphone
Accumulate the provolone makin' it happen with talib
A nattian cat we got em' snappin' roberta flackin' the track and
Killin' em softly with out flossin'
But yet the shine is glossy and
The run the lyrical train through your brain shit
Strategy pain, I'm on some clubber lane shit
With the iron, ain't no use in you trying "I ain't lyin'"
Through your ears mesmerize em'
It's about time we started risin'
Once again replace bullets with words, try to make it fun again
We make the music that change your life

Terrorist hijack on hi tek fly tracks front don't try that
My niggas got my back, you gotta relax, ease back
What's that all about with the feedback?
All up in my mouth we don't need that
Enjoy life open up a tree sack
Take a trip past thought no passport just leave that
The asphalt is the place to be at
Where the people fire burn so bright you can see that believe that

We make the right music (true)
Keep it tight music (yes)
Affirmin' life music (come on)

My favorite part on the face is the shape of the lips
Yeah I wanna touch you there (right there)
Your mind is my concubine, when I deliver shivers up your spine
Wordsy and that's your soul like the bread and wine
My brain is embedded with rhyme, that's ahead of they time
I rock the better design
You cats ain't got the touch
You all suck, like getting head from a dime
I run up in em and, touch them with the rhythm and
Clutch em' if they tremblin'
It's a rush like adrenaline, at a point break the joint shake
When you play this (yeah), your crew is haters when they come
Through with the newest latest (like that)
Reflection eternal
Shine light bright like the day till the sky turn purple
And the moon arrive, reflection through the night
That touch you just right
With the rhythm, the rhythm, god bless the rhythm
It's the rhythm, rhythm; yes ya'll the rhythm
Shorty on the dance floor giving me rhythm
Hi tek make ya'll nod ya'll neck to the rhythm

and stop making songs so cheesy
now manny fresh is actually fresh
and juvenille
i like his style
but the worst rapper i ever heard is the whack ass mutha fucka birdman
what about silk the shocker?
my name is silk and i shock u
ive just been shocked by silk the shocker!

get-I get my paper all the time, I keep tellin' you
[Swizz]
Cassidy the problem, c'mon!
All my people out there, gettin that cake man
Take somethin out your pocket, and put it in the air like this
Put it in the air like this, and say some shit like this, c'mon
[Chorus]
I get my paper on my block, I get my paper from my block
I get my paper ALL THE TIME I KEEP TELLIN YOU~!
I get my paper on my block, I get my paper from my block
I get my paper all the time I keep tellin you
[Cassidy]
Look if you deal coke and you still broke, start grindin more homes
Cause I'ma drug conniseur homes
In the hood good jobs is hard to find like dinosaur bones
I'm tryin to start shinin more homes
That's why I make 'em hurry up and buy like that china store homes
Cause they'll give you time for a dime or more of stones
And tellin ain't my twist, I ain't that kind of boy homes
But a lot of niggaz singin like the Commodores homes
I'm ridin when it's time for war homes
The chrome on my hip, can flip a fully grown dinosaur homes
I'm the kind of boy known to split domes when I pop the Taurus
I spray rounds that could lay down a tyrannosaurus
My mind like a thesaurus, I'ma shine regardless
My brain a dictionary, lames I'm quick to bury
I spit scriptures and put pictures on obituaries
So get your own sound or hustle a home now, nigga!
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
[Cassidy]
Yeah! E'ry bar that I write like a brick of that hard white
I've truly been blessed, it's a gift from the Lord Christ
But yo if you livin the hard life
You can't get back the hand you was dealt, so play your cars right
They say you ain't promised tomorrow right? (Nope)
So I stay in the street, like a deer that stay in that car lights
With the high beams on and the fog lights lit
I get, my lean on on some B.A.R.S. type shit
Until, my cream gone I'ma ball like this
In my all white tee and my all white kicks
And I still toss the white on the strip that's why I floss like this
With the frostbite wrist cause we all quite rich, I love this life!
I threw different color ice, in my cross like Swizz
And all I give broads is hard type dick; have 'em twirlin they tongue
Yeah I know I got a girl and a son, but umm
It's a man's world and I'm as thorough as they come - WHAT?!
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
[Cassidy]
Yeah! I'm from a block where niggaz get it poppin at
Where cats is known for boxin and poppin gats
But you gotta aim low when you poppin that
Cause that hot shit got kick like a soccer match
I'm from where the M-1's and the choppers at
Feel me where you can come to go gun shoppin at
You rockin plaque, got your chain with the watch to match
Watch your back if you go and you ain't got your gat
Cats'll jack your pop he ain't got a strap
Cats'll rob your mom if she got a stack
Cause niggaz tryin to get paid
And niggaz not tryin to get waged when they rockin the stockin cap
Round the way they got gourmet pots of crack
And you would spend like 24 for a block of that
My niggaz tryin to get the cheese but no not the rat
I'm from a block where snitchin ain't a option at
[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Chico]
Lady you've been on some bullshit
Listening to your jealous friends
Don't you think I woulda left a long time ago?
Uh, it's been six months
I work hard to make the ends meet
And what's bad, you got the nerve to disrespect me
Your girlfriends wish they had
One half of what you have
1 -	[Chico & Joe]
You don't understand
The make up of a man
If I treat you like a dog
Then you want to stay
If I treat you like a woman
Then you want to walk away
I don't understand, listen to your man
2 - I'm your man, baby
You're my girl, lady
Tell me what does that mean to you
In a middle of a fuss
Tell me who you're gonna trust
You cousin's baby's momma's best friend?
Listen to your man
[Joe]
You say I am only just a loser
I'm gonna use you, they got your mind twisted
You messed up, broke our contract
What's up with that?
Don't know what to do
It's unusual how they run your life
And behind your back they're telling lies
Repeat 1
Repeat 2 (2x)
[Both]
(Think) Think about it baby
(Think) Think, think, think about it baby
(Think) Think, think, think about it baby, whoa
(Think) Hey think about it
(Think) One more time
(Think) Two more times, had enough baby
(Think) Of your stuff
(Think) Jealousy
(Think) And envy
Will mostly bring you down
(Think) Jealousy
(Think) And envy
(Think) Look at your friends
(Think) They'll know me
Give me a chance
Listen up baby I'm your man
Listen up babe understand baby
Understand your man
(Think) Think about it
(Think) I work too hard
(Think) I pay the bills I work too hard
(Think) I pay the bills
(Think) Come on baby
(Think) Come on baby
(Think, think, think)
(Think) Think about it
(Think) Think about it
(Think) Think about it
(Think) Think about it baby
Repeat 2 (2x) with ad libs
Listen, your man ain't your man unless he wants to be there
Think about, think about your choice of friends
Cause you give up running and booze that don't mean jack
If you knew what you got you would trust your respect
If you can not trust in maybe you should leave it
Repeat 2 with ad libs until fade

Pay attention it costs less than paying a lawyer
Taking advice could help more than taking an offer
That came from the court full of racists who judge on basis of color
We grace with, they hate us, we slaves no longer

[Chorus]
All day and all night
Nigga anytime you see me I'ma keep it super tight
I'm an underground king reppin' UGK
Don't give a damn what a motherfucker say
I'ma keep it (100)
All night and all day
Nigga anytime you see me I'm reppin' PA
This is UGK for life long live Pimp C
And I'ma never let a nigga pimp me
I'ma keep it (100)
Cause its all that I've ever known
All that I've ever been, all that I've ever shown
Get your shit together clone
Build a better prototype, you lookin' like a mop
And I'm lookin' for a floor to wipe
I heard your album man if thats what you call it
Another gangster fairytale for that shit we ain't fallin'
All you talkin' bout is slangin', bangin', bussin', and ballin'
But I ain't see your scary ass all star in New Orleans
I'm gettin' tired man this shit is gettin' older than moses
Pussy niggas always poutin' with poses
But all it really shows is how hard you ain't
A nigga bust your ass in mouth you probably faint
Not from the power of the punch, but the shock
Cause you a coward and niggas gonna devour your lunch
A bunch of niggas done tried, but ain't too many don't it like me
Its Bun B the G and I'ma keep it one hundred
[Chorus]
Cause thats exactly what the trill do
Ain't nobody tellin' me what I wont or I will do
If I don't feel you,
You lucky that I don't kill you
Leavin'you leakin' till your out of mildew for real dude
I got this skill to don't make me have to show it
Cause it'll be over before you know it
You get one shot and I suggest you don't blow it
If I do it I overdue it make you have to goin' sew it
I'ma revolutionary black pistol
You fuckin' with fire, fuck around and get a blister
I fuck with a poppa then fuck around and hit a sister
I'm an underground king motherfucker call me Mister
Kilogram, Mr. Woodgrain, Mr. Brick,
And unless you the Mrs. get off the Mr. dick
Cause this the shit that have motherfuckers runnin' for the hills
From the king of the trill, cause I keep it one hundred
[Chorus]
Cause now a days motherfuckers lie
Some to the face, some cant even look you in the eye
Some in this place, some just have left, and some just comin' by
A little later probably a little hater
And they goin' feel the faders
Tryin' to prove they the greatest
And they still gonna be wronger than fuck, so holla later
I'm leavin' I'm not a waiter
But ill end up serve you, tryin' to step up to the likes me, why the nerve of you
Well I never and I do declare
I'm bout to fuck the game up now its best you prepare
Put on your bib cause I'm fittin' to be spittin'
That hot fire so you better bring mittens
Cause yous a pussy and your partner is kitten's
I do 'em and when I'm done they be like no he didn't
Get your toilet paper nigga cause I'm fittin' to be shittin'
Diariadict on haters with no quitin' and I'ma keep it one hundred
[Chorus]

You say you wanna love me, you say I'm just a fake
You say I'm just another one that never had your back
Do you feel my presence, maybe I should go?
Maybe I'm another that you need to let go, see
One day if you let me I will try and mend this broken vase
Yeah, my heart will save us cause I am never giving up on us
So if you love me, you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
'Cause if you need me, you should have never pushed me away
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you never see
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
They say that I'm a liar cause I'm from an estate
But what you say behind my back you know I'll say it to your face
I wish we could let bigons be bigons and so on and fire on
For you I swear I'll catch another case (hey)
So if you love me, you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
And if you need me, you should have never pushed me away (hey, hey)
It's like you've been waiting on a different me (it's like you been waiting)
You say it could get better but you never see (you never see)
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me ('cause I)
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it (when it comes down)
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
I weren't brought up round money so I didn't know how to treat it
I helped everyone round me and spent it all just when I needed it
I made a mil' and splashed it, did it all again
This time round, can't even trust myself, let alone my friends
If I'm the man why they don't play me no more?
That can't be fair right?
Just don't get it cause I'm on their side
I wish they wore these Nikes, took a hike
To see what it's like, in my spare time
And then come back and tell me that I deserve to lose all my air time
So don't be waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you never see
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you never see
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya

The Villain ain't rhymin off cred alone
Let him get some cognac, a mic and a headphone
Smoke the mirrors, caught her in the mix
Couldn't read the shorthand for mortars and bricks
If any negative thought linger he let it vent
Wrote this one with his middle finger in wet cement
Did it on the sly
Before he's gone bye bye spit it on the fly
Brush your teeth, rinse and gargle
A true nerd who messed with new words since Boggle
And used slang in Scrabble
Rhymed with a Northern drawl, twang and babble
Flossy pen jargon to break the world record
Do a Faustian bargain and tape the girl naked
More spots than a leopard
Then he had to stop, the block was hot peppered
Shepherd, leading the sheeps out to slaughter
Kept your soul and repped it, everytime he saw ya
Tryin to douse a pinch of weed in a frat street house
I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!
Welcome to the show
Remember whatever you do, do not boo the flow
Schooled the dumb on the number one rule of thumb
What a fool; still you never met a cooler bum
Give the drummer some rum, I'm sure he could use a shot
Just to get his cues hot, ensure he don't lose his spot
A stranger who speaks to you vocal
Danger made the beat get a freak to do the bogle
No bull, everything he wanted they grabbed and took
Whole lab looked like an ill left jab and hook
Even had a secretary to take the calls
Shake it and make it fall, I told her don't break my balls
Wherever Mouse go, trouble follows
The bounty on this pro was mills and "double dollars"
Vil's spills muddled flows that befuddle scholars
Thick Buffalo girl with the bubble hollars
She rocked leather and gold, a fat blouse
And need a brother with soul to let her cat out
Even if the rat couldn't compete with Kraus
I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!
Tap ya toe, grime and strapped for dough
Rap for show, to let the whippersnappers know
Sucks to be them, now pass that loot
Up under the tux he wore a hazmat suit
Sounded like froggy, sip the groggiest of potions
Be up in the party with the foggiest of notions
On the list of lobbyists who save the oceans
Gave his donation to the lady with the lotions
Swoll hand itchin, the old man bitchin
Switchin with the fan with the gold band twitchin
Spittin like a bionic sneeze that freeze vodka
Just to clear the air like the Ionic Breeze Quadra
Sleek enough to outsly a fox
For a chicken pot pie, thinkin outside the box
Enough to taste her goody
But got no time to be wastin chasin putty
Out for Daffy Duck bucks, Porky Pig paper
Bugs Bunny money or Sylvester Cat caper
Offer DAT tape of rap, country or deep house
And
I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!

[Chorus: x2 Chamillionaire]
Can't like the hustle man, don't hate the player hate the game.
Gotta love it man.
Catch me flippin' grippin' grain in the turnin' lane, trunk on bang.
Cause its an underground thing cause I'm an underground king.
[Bun B]
Its Bun B the king of the Trill and I'm bringin the steel
Bringin' the maximum bitches that gangsta shit im bringin it back.
I went from slangin' the crack to slangin' the tracks and slangin' my skills
Since 92 and slangin' it still
So bring who you feel bring who you feeling
Bring em around and I'ma lay them down its just another sound boy killin'.
Rude boy wanna test better make sure rude boy got on his vest
Walk with a bunch of bananas on his chest.
These monkey niggas on that monkey shit.
Best keep a revolver I boss like a gorilla and kill 'em with a revolver.
So go on pimpin you's a chimp and I'ma do that
You ain't ready for the blow-back
DJ you already do that
So bring who you wanna bring on I'ma go King Kong
I'll squeeze him till he come up off his cream like a ding dong.
Standin' on top of the towers the trans go beatin' my chest
So it's best you and your mans know I'ma underground king.
[Chorus: x2]
[Pimp C]
I'ma underground king for life, get my good and put in your wife
Tattoo thats you on a island nigga you a pig you buyin' the q.
Sound scan and short bro bump right like a tylo.
Fake price buy ice use it for the ton of snow.
Ball faced lier try to call me a snitch I ditch
The full population with a ball faced bitch
If it wasn't for that Bun niggas might not know my name no more
But every time they gave me my mic he told them hoes to let me go.
DJ trippa suckin' on nipples pimpin on grands she playin' with cock
Pull that zippa she aint Twista she get money fast now its in her mouth
Nigga you know what I'm about if you silent I'm gonna ride
I run the south this is my house I tell the truth even when I lie.
Atlanta is the country and Georgia boys cool
Its all you out of town fagot niggas fuckin' up all the rules.
That ain't blow thats reckon
That ain't dro thats popcorn
You fuckin' right they comin' back
Like you sellin' it cheap cause they stepped on, bitch
[Chorus: x2]
[Chamillionaire]
No reprise for the cars I'm stayin' up in the foreign.
Wanna wake up my neighbors and the other clicks in the mornin'
If me and Bun wasn't tourin' I swear the game would be borin'
If bein' fake was a felony all yall rappers be starrin'.
In Americas most wanted I missed that Pimpin' and Pac
So it seems that me and Bun B is the realest people you got
My paper chase gettin' faster I'm even beaten the clock.
When it comes to gs the tick tock is gonna get beat to the dock.
Gave birth to the hustle so let my fetus be shown
When I pull out them baby Benjamin's and I skeet on your dome.
I'm secreetin' the dough so don't leave your women alone
Ill turn my dick to a dollar and give your women a loan
My presence on the Texas streets is somethin' easy to spot
I'll assassinate concrete for the G's I'm bleedin' the block.
Boys'll see me on swingers and think its easy to plot
But I bet them boys behind me wont be beamin' up Scott.
[Chorus: x2]

Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
'Cause I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R-ah
Okay start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models, "shut up bitch, swallow!"
If you can't swallow, shut up bitch gargle
Straight up out that water with my Marc Jacobs goggles
Fresher than a mother fucker, yep I'm a mother fucker
No I won't take your girl, but I'll sure take her tongue from her
Can't you tell I'm in love woman, like no other woman
Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
'Cause I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R-ah
As I recline behind my desk
I ain't got a lot of Nikes but I got a lot of checks
Got my own shoe brand, new on the set
Went from sittin' in a cell to sittin' on a jet
From shittin' in a cell to shittin' on a jet
I lost too many friends, but I won too many bets
I made too much money, but I ain't make enough yet
So I scratched and, yes, Jr. is the best
So many niggas from my hood on they back
So many niggas from your hood on they back
That's why we so paid and it be like that
I'd rather pop a bottle before I pop a Gat
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
'Cause I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R-ah
Yeah only sipping red champagne
White tee red hat red bandanna
Uptown, choppers for companions
Fuckin' with the Birdman then we fuck up your companion
Fuckin' with my son and we run up in your mansion
Chopper make music, bitch start dancin'
Stunna man back so you know the circumstances
And I'm cookin' up the Carter 3, no advances
All my cars automated, automatic
No lie we don't even drive no Astons
Uptown we packin' and we stackin'
Young Money, Cash Money we the champions

(quik - talking)
Wow, for real though
We need something just a little bit different
Ya know, it's a whole lot goin on right now
But y'all can calm down though, y'all can
'cause we 'bout to change the game

If you really wanna change the game let me hear ya say 'ohh yeah'
Haha, I just had to do that once
Ay, t-p-t style
Jumpin up outta the burb', park mode
And 18 inches from the curb
While I'm smellin them stanky stenches from the herb
Red-eyed flight, and I'm lookin for my red-eyed homie
Black tone, 'cause I said I might
Just hafta pass through, and let 'em hear some shit that's pretty fat
From spade ty to king tee, this is where it's at
Nigga, makin million dollar deals at a checker table
And my nephews gonna be the youngest niggas with a record label
I'm the only nigga that promised to show up
With more talent than any nigga and I didn't wanna blow up
I shine like glitter 'cause I'm natural
If on the first night I hit, then that's a hoe

And I'll make a statement only on a brew and a joint

Dollar signs, attitudes, dog in a real way
Condos to sky scrapers with my name on it
Desk, big see-e-o, rider from the black tek

{Bubba} Feel me
{Timbaland}
Uhh! .. Uhh!

Catch me on a, backroad, or cookin in your momma's house
In your daughter's guts, or just spazzin out
Me and Bubba know what the hell we talkin 'bout
Pickin up Betty's like they was beans and brussel sprouts
We got the clout to make you bounce a little
We got the clout to make you down this pickle, until you gettin tickled
c'mon Bubba let's surround this biddle
While you work the back bit Timbaland work the middle
Uh-oh, uh-oh! I see ya see ya smile
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Down comes your blouse
Timb' been around 'em all
From white to black, even magnoli-all
To hit 'em in project halls
In back of the streets maybe right in front of y'all (ha ha ha)
Timb' and Bubba is a problem y'all
It's like hip-hop, meets effin Tim McGraw
We two fools and don't take no mess
Bitch lumber logs just to work the chest
He's country finest, I'm country best
Puttin lights out train, just get in that dress, now c'mon
{Chorus 2X: Timbaland}
Twerk a little, twerk a little, let me see you drop it
Work the middle, work the middle, let me see you pop it
Go on! Witcha bad self
c'mon! Witcha bad self
{Bubba Sparxxx}
I brought enough with me to start this bitch a college fund
Fitted Boy and Polo, and she ain't even got a son
Timmy kind of shy, told me to tell you drop it some
Here Betty, take this grand, get your monthly shoppin done
You can shake for dem but bet that you don't profit none
I got a coochie fart fetish, baby pop me one
While you by the bar I grab your boy a shot of rum
I'm the shit to the point you gotta stop I got the runs
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Why they all on Timmy?
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Ten grand is all they give me
Still got a grand left, can I let my hand rest
right there on your damn chest, fondlin your tan breast
I might just snap back and cuss a broad
But this bitch is truly blessed so I must applaud
In and out of every club in less than a hour
Sprinkle on a little Pervis like I'm fresh out the shower
Ohhhh! And rest assured Timmy runnin with Bubba
We gettin slurped by two sluts right in front of each other
And we'll probably do the same thang next Monday evening
I gotta ride this Bentley home cause Timmy's out so we leavin, now
::Chorus::
{female singer}
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh
{Timbaland}
I'm comin baby as fast as I can
So while you're waitin won'tcha go 'head and talk to my man, uh
{female singer}
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh
{Bubba}
Thank you Timmy, I don't mind yo' sloppy seconds
But when I send her back to you I bet we both infected
{female singer}
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh
{Timbaland}
Bubba won'tcha just do what I tell ya
She got some good snapper (yes she do) damnit didn't I tell ya?
{female singer}
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh
.. Won't you put in my mouth, won't you put in my mouth?
{Bubba}
Now, that's what I'm talkin 'bout!
{Chorus - 1.5X}

Our evening began in Peter Seychelle's comfortable study
In his new york townhouse
Where the candle light was just right
The hi-fi was in the background
And the wine was delicious
What's the secret, Peter?
Naturally, I'll say it's the wine
Mmm, it does go well with the chicken
Delicious again, Peter

[Krayzie: x2]
People ask me how do you maintain
You got to keep your mind on money (T-H-you-G)
Don't let the snakes ever short you for ya change
Nigga, let 'em know how much you want it
[Krayzie]
Nigga 1993, hooked up with Eazy-E
1994, rushing through the door with the Bone flow
Nigga was creeping on a come up, doing it for the love of money
1995 we really let 'em know, Cleveland is the city where we come from
Brought styles motherfuckers never heard before
But we never got our props
'til we dropped that said song, see you at the crossroad
But the man know, Eazy running with the lost souls, rest in peace
That was 1996, we back in the mix
I guess they thought that we'd gon' quit but we got love for this shit
But everything started changing, business rearranging
Then the time when Bone and Ruthless wasn't vibing
Tried to keep my mind together through that industry shit
Somehow I'm feeling like what I deserve I didn't get
But I'ma stick it out, believe I'ma keep my head up
And show my loyalty for Eazy E, even though I'm fed up
1997 hey, everybody grab ya weapon, its the art of war
It don't stop, it won't stop until we drop, body rott
Not to mention when we venture through the family scriptures
1999 nigga, still struggling
Trying to get some money with this mastermind I'm juggling
Sharpen up ya thug mentality
And by the year 2000 I'll be thugging, but so immaculate
I gotta get some money, blast if I get hungry
So if you read that I done flipped, then you know the story, about me
[Chorus]
(Ed. note-I'm not too sure about any of this verse)
Take a good look into my eyes, and all over my face your bloody death
With a bloody bloody, mess, I'm serving you none the less
? that crazy motherfucker from the world's most dangerous group
Mo Thugs Nation, ? on your life
That's absolutely what I'm gon' do
Blast at them niggas who thought they knew me
Now I'm that motherfucker that be ?, the nigga that bust all y'all
My mission in life to be the coldest nigga that ever spit shit on the mic
I'm coming in smooth, rocking this hip-hop music just the way you like
Telling all biters to please stop trying
Let it go fry fool, when I make my move all y'all gonna die
Split up and fry, open his eyes ? pop,
Shot one through his head
Oh my, oh my, now look what you made me do, this nigga dead
It ain't my fault, you niggas too soft, ain't got no skill
Now look through the ?, stop steel
Y'all some fake-thug living tryna get notice by hanging with stars
No need to say no names, niggas know who the fuck you are
We all true sound, nigga united gathering souls, how we roll
And that's love for the paper, folding, I saw these hoes
But I had my ?, nah nigga that's my nuts ? don't touch that
And then he won't hesitate to buck for the love
You can't dust on these bustas, so they die
They only got love for those who love me
In the meanwhile I main to keepin my mind on my money
And no, this shit that we spit ain't funny
Especially when you hungry, nigga
With no hustle, nigga, to get them funds
[Chorus]
[Bizzy]
In '91 I'm running from the fucking cops, don't ya know it
That bitch was trying to find a hiding spot, he show it
Know niggas that'd had no pussy
Said that would never read or get to L.A.
And niggas went cannibal on 'em, either
Smoking that reefer, niggas know how I'm living
'Cause I was having children when y'all was looking for women
But mine aside, so why you telling your same ?
When niggas ain't have shit, tell me who's the one that ride
We gon' ride ride though, you can call me Mr. Murda-mo
Get ?, burn the whole store down all by myself
? for fucking with the Bone flow
Heaven and Earth, God and my loved one, and ya gotta roll
And what you want my people to hear, that I'm a fucking sell-out?
But who's the one on solo shit, and who want me the hell out?
I'll bail out with a ?, that pussy makes me change
Or expansion on the mansion or acres in the shooting range
Shooting things (shooting things), it don't make you a villain
The villain is chillin with his children
Bitch, I keeps it real!
[Chorus]
[Layzie]
I keep my mind on my money, my money on my mind
A straight up soldier in the field out here pushin my line
Nigga designed a gold crime as I'm racin through this obstacle
007, Layzie Bone, knew it was possible
Got shot, got out the hospital, started on my mission
Listen, nigga pay attention
Oh, and did I mention, had a tape before I crept on a come up, Faces of Death
Blessin 40 o-z's, Lay and Leather face and double Z's ?
Niggas often wonder why my mind on my money
Nigga these bitches all up on me, and half the industry phoney
It's like this nigga, I don't even fuck around
If a nigga ain't got no money for Lay, I'll come around
Ain't it funny how niggas turn funny-style
When they think they fall in trinkets, ain't even ran a mile
See my niggas doin a damn thing, Flesh
Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls, just to let you know
Heaven's Movie, yours truly, Mr. Gambini
(Krayzie)It's the mentality, and next to the baddest, little Stevie
And when you ask me how I maintain
I watch my niggas rule, act a fool, and ace the game
Mo Thug one, witness the Family Scriptures
Mo Thug two, Family Reunion comin to get ya
Mo Thug three, presentation of the mothership
Niggas on some other shit, by smoke and maintain
[Chorus]

then I went to church the next sunday and prayed for him
I said jeepers creepers i be my brothers keeper
so i blew his head off with the street sweeper
wicket shit starting off the blunt i was sparking
I had to shoot my next door neighbors dog, he kept barking
kept me up all night, when I was tryin to write
this very suicidal wicket shit i had to recite
wicket walking, wicket talkin while the chickens keep squaking
let my paper keep stackin, twelve dozen eggs is crackin

vultures circling the sky awaiting your end
like a fortune telling witch, follow me I know the way
use your head as a crystal ball , I see your dying day

I black out then you black out when you thought I was your Friend
just when you thought your life was coming together for the better
the wicket shit strikes again, forever It'll scare ya
I hear some screams at night, for I see the fear in your eyes
I snap out of it, but it starts again at Sunrise

it breaths, it eats, and it hates
the only way to beat it, is to think like it
(equipto)
i suprise with the amazin the fires ablazin
all suckas gonna hate when i arise to the occasion
you ran off with ? hide in the basement
could study your whole life just trying to taste it
we rat pack take over the stats and trophy
talk trash and really got a choice like (sophie?)
so o.g. never caught livin a movie

from the bay like gp, like floyd i'm sleepy,
on your weak ass raps so leave me
(andre)
breath easy, my tony brakston tha passion
my lucky ass mind got me into newest fashion
rap blastin, silver surfer on the glide
a hoarse kick just like a colt 45
man all up in your mind like a (cardier?) design
and i'll be standing right behind when your credit card decline,
get outta line
i spin a web like a spider
man hit the ice house in the middle, yell fire
man do it how ya wanna man and take it how ya gonna
cause all ya gonna hear is no contest ya honor
i live the lifestyle of the wild crocadile
man pull ya under water then i giggle when ya drown
men theres nothin that the law allow
take it with a frown
my mug shot before they took the picture had the smile
man holla at me now
4 or 5 rounds
cutting through the make-up just to shake up these clowns
(equipto)
ya quezzy ? blunts, and fat dubees

i swing the bat, and i love to singin rap, on a track,
and i'll be the one ya point ya finger at
i'm gonna do it like a master

Esham:
1st verse
When i wake up in the morning i got to puff the gan
a pocket full of money saying IM THE MAN.
got a bitch on my line im gonna fuck today cause i didnt
get a chance to yesterday
ima hit the buzz spot and cop a bag of true
no im bout to tell you what i fina do
ima call this bitch set this date see if i can come fuck
before eight
and if i can come fuck, bust a nut, all day i be talking
bout nigga what
i got a homie in jail doing life for sure for living in detroit making it
snow
Got a nigga on the west side buying my o'z, behind closed doors he
sniffs it in his nose
want to be like scarface sniffing the white im fucking this niggas bitch all last night
and she telling how the nigga aint fucked her right, telling me all the news like Walter Kronkite
i said look here bitch i aint your man, the shits played out like dapper dan
and if you looking for love you end up wrong place
get your panties out your ass and get the fuck out my face.
2nd verse
First thing that i learned when i got in the game.
was never talk down on a player's name
like steve russel and white boy rick got the fbi all on my dick
Im a young ass nigga with lots of loot, the aligotor boots and aint afraid to shoot
if you bitch on my line nigga i did that cause all hoes recognize me as the mac
i dont care who tell i want to do the brat, pull th ebitch brains and fuck her from the back
i want to smoke me a blunt with cheech and chong, niggas get fucked up all night long
I want a check on friday to buy some boones a fresh pair of khakis and some fruit of the looms
take me out the hood but not the hood out me
an oz began and some hennesey
see i dont give a fuck you dont like my rhyme
a nigga like me high all the time
and we al

So now lets let into, in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic, black ethic lack
I walk again, you were shade gray, come display
Mazes in black, fire in the west
Shit is shakin', it's fly
I'm in lookies when I'm pushing vinyl time
Up the fort, where I'm caught
And my thought to shakin' up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot, KRS One
Cause we fade in and out, are you swinging or coming?
I'm solid on this thought, this ain't living
It's heavy every setback, even when I was a shorty
Now we catch you in your four, thrice
Check me in another place, space, and joy
Nothing you could serve could ever
Ace me boy
Fat laces, I'm out, fat and no babies
"That's right baby"
That's right, sho you right
I got Harlem on my mind, Darren on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and butter's on the track
I got insect thoughts, catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz, the jive, the poetry
The style, the lingo, the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock, I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot, they can't won't don't stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit, with my bugged out clique
It's Doodlebug, give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice, it's kind of rough
Sevens never bluff, I had enough, eleven
That's right, sho you right
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevin's braids, we got four in the lac
As we swoop at warp seven, holler don't crowd cats
Cause look, corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber I'm saying oh
And we keep it popping on hot days
Shit, I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out, fool
Easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
I'm fro, blow, got that right
Groove with soul and I'm still spinnin'
Cross 110 and indicate them something else
Blackest space, deepest sea
(Scoff) My shit's, a natural high, the man can't put no thing on me
So dig me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black
Time reaching into end, nappy afro blue
I swoop, out and inside the corners
Do my tha-a-ang like Huey with it, nigga
That's right, sho you right

Boogie Down Productions will always get paid
We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
Cause then you'll begin, to master
Rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'
Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's [ass]
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls
Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go
I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher
You're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing?
I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both Criminal Minded
We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for 87 not no 1983
Well versed, to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rocking parties now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way
Criminal minded

This morning I woke up and something had changed
I felt kinda good and it felt kinda strange
There's something going on here
And maybe it's a brand new world or I'm just crazy, insane
So, every thing's different, well, I guess that's okay
'Cause those thoughts that used to hold me down have all gone away
I feel like I can take on the world
So come along for the ride or just get out of my way
Come on, come on, get up, get up
Let's go, won't you follow me?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Come on, come on, get up, get up
Let's go, won't you follow me?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
So tell me your secrets and I'll sell you my soul
There's a shovel in my heart and it's digging a hole
The devil and the God in my head
Are having breakfast in my brain and it's driving me insane
Come on, come on, get up, get up
Let's go, won't you follow me?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Come on, come on, get up, get up
Let's go, won't you follow me?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Won't you follow me now?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Won't someone follow me now?
Won't someone follow me?
Come on, come on, get up, get up
Let's go, won't you follow me?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Come on, come on, get up, get up
Let's go, won't you follow me?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Let's go, won't you follow me now?
Won't someone follow me now?

Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, I guess you just might
Want to do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
No matter is you or your brother's a star
He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, just to get a rep
Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, "we'll hurt you"
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, "yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?"
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said, "now" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah-yeah
Uhh, this goes out to all the wolves
Hah, in the streets and in jail
Yeah, yo it's your man big L
139, danger zone
I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out, uhh, bust it
Aiyyo I just left the studio and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin' a song, now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And it's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep, my voice is hoarse, barely can speak
I called back on the cell, it's Corle', mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
"I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn"
"It's my wife, you sure?", "Yeah I'm sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door"
"Say no more, which one?"
"The one in Jersey son, right over the bridge"
"We goin' hurt those hoes"
"And hurt both of them kids"
Now I'm in the range
Switchin' lanes, doin' a buck 'n change
I can't wait to buck them lames and them fuckin' dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggaz fuckin' up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin' the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin' like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin' the cup
Lookin' like he can't wait to start sprayin' shit up
"Yo, who that in the background?" "It's Tommy Gibbs"
"Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down"
Son you ready? We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared, it's no time to back out
We gon' take the back route, pull the gats out, throw the mask on
We ain't leavin' 'til everyone's dead, and all the cash gone
We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do" "So let's do it"
I stepped to the desk clerk, put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
"They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?" She paused and said, "212"
I took the steps now I'm out of breath, I gotta stop smokin'
Them cigarettes gon' be the 'cause of my death
My heart beatin' fast now, 'cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced, I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggaz ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin'
These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate
We know they got stacks
'Cause they don't fuck with nothin' but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose
And then I kicked mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
"You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at"
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 ki's in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass and two million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
Then put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Corle' done popped them punks
"Aiyyo fuck it l, we might as well pop these studs"
Now that's four bodies, two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money three ways
Now we all laughin' hard, gettin' nice and weeded
Celebratin' nigga, heist completed

Verse 1
I don?t want tragedy to be the only
Thing that leads me to your throne
With every moment of my life
With pain or joy I will cry
You are God alone
You?ve given me the choice to kneel or walk away
I?ve struggled with surrender long enough to say
Chorus
I choose now
To be humbled in your presence
I choose now
To fall on my face
Cause one day
Every knee will bow but Jesus
I choose now.
Verse 2
I have the scars I can?t deny from
Thoughtless words and foolish times
But you still forgave
I wondered down a thousand roads
Lost my way but you led me home
Where I was safe
I know heaven is a gift of your grace
But until I see your face
I choose now
To be humbled in your presence
I choose now
To fall on my face
Cause one day
Every knee will bow but Jesus
I choose
Bridge
To glorify your name
That?s why I was made
To worship and obey
I won?t wait
I choose now
To be humbled in your presence
I choose now
To fall on my face
Cause one day
Every knee will bow but Jesus
I choose now.
I choose now
To be humble in Your presence
I choose now
To fall on my face
Cause one day
Every knee will bow but Jesus
I choose now
Jesus I choose now.

They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
"Atmosphere finally made a good record."
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt a sinking contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cinnci'
"Get real." they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it
Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Mrs. Pac-Man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be askin', "Yo, where did all the passion go?"
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes (YES!)
God Bless America, but she stole the B from "Bless" (Accept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'ma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps (You know!)
[Chorus x2]
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God, oh they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance
[Slug]
So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and sense
It's eat, sleep, fuck in self defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait, let's prey on blind, deaf, dumb, dead
Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hands
Yeah I got some last words, FUCK ALL OF YA'LL!
Stop writin' raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of droppin' these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive that's why you're killin 'em
Guilty of settin' my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium
[Chorus x2]
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God, oh they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance
I gotta find my balance
I gotta find my balance
[Slug]
Now all my friends are famous
It's either one thing or another
They all don't know what my name is
Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier
I'm just your next door neighbor
Workin' hard at tryin' to stay sober
You wait for the car at the corner
Pretend like you know what the pot is
Won't quit till I hit California
And make you my Golden State goddess

Yeah! That's the beat right there.
I'm about to black out with 100 bars on some professional shit.
So don't try this at home yo.
Yo yo yo
My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans
Because I recognize its all about timin'
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science
In front of 20 ft. bonfires lookin' skyward
Calculating May 5 2000 the nine planets'll be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit
Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet
With mercury ion rockets
And a big ass "Canibus comin soon" poster on the side of it
I'm known geographically and intergalactically
That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me
They even tried kidnappin' me
And they would've snatched me
If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity
Engines stalled and failed. Crashed into a farmer's field
And that's really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12
Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal
Lyrically I'm off scale
So all hail or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y'all feel
Briusin' niggas, confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds
Wack niggas want to be down but its not allowed
Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth
With the southpaw southern fist
I'll bust your shit. Swell your lip and get the Bubba shrimp
Back the tougher shit. What a wimp
You giant Goliath. Niggas get shot with a rubber sling
I'm an experiment gone bad.
My brainwave's on an ????? graph. Yo, I'm stark ravin mad
Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast
When I throw the ????? flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode
And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircrafts
Trained in chemical weapons class
Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last
I put him in a leather mask
Spray his ass with a can of ???? gas
Then watch him grab his neck and gag
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh
"You want to battle?" is the type of question you should never ask
Nigga, pick a tougher task. See who the fuck'll last
Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass
You need to recognize
My hand is quicker than the eye
Quicker than the 5 speed Jamiroquai drives
A lifespan longer than 9 lives. Infinite rhymes that can't die
A nigga with a divine mind
I dedicate this to the wise. Dedicate it to dames
Dividin' myself into 100 ten times
You can't deny the offering's an offer
Flows that glow with aurora's the spark of light
Water fly like a saucer
With the torque of a Porsche
Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins
Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'm a live long
And I'm a be gettin' it on till I'm gone
Look at all the stages I been on. All the songs that I spit on
I took an oath to rip everything I get on
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndromes
In the wristbones from grippin' microphones this long
I'm just a small fish in a big pond
And gets pissed off whenever I gets picked on
Nigga try to flip and get flipped on
My army march a million strong
Like the nation of Islam with suede timbs on
Extremely hostile
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles
A lyrical lynch mob
Shittin' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on
Duckin' down low like Vietnam fightin' the Vietcong
Screamin' "incomin'" when I see a bomb
Speak to your leader. Surrender your arms
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus 800,000 to even consider a war
And 200,000 more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors
And smash y'all. Attach y'all to the back of my horse
And drag y'all across the motherfuckin' asphalt
9 out of 10 niggas is frauds
You know who you are always talkin' about your bitches and your cars
Your jewelry and your girls. It's like we from two different worlds
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves
'Cause I'm beyond them, on some futuristic cyborg shit
I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what picture crossed in
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience
To barbecue your brain organs
You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven
I flame broil suckers and hit 'em with some more shit
The raw shit. Call my reinforcements, the four horsemen
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit
I dare a motherfucker to cross it
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin
Tell him it's important. Tell him to call Sting 3 way and sing a
[Chorus]
Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers can't record it
Call the news, I'll kill your reporters
Start a lawsuit, I'll kill your lawyers
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y'all think
My album's gold cause my album was the bomb, shit
Y'all niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys
You fuck 'em in the ass, then you give 'em cash for it
That's some sick shit homeboy
A hundred years ago, they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud
You fraudulent. Feminine. Fragile as a feather is
With an effortless blow, I'll crack your whole skeleton
You think you're better than Canibus, where's the evidence?
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
You need to shut the fuck up cause your breath stink
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Battlin' me you never win
You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in?
Nigga guess again
'Cause after I'm finished wreckin this shit
I'm a drink a whole bottle of Henney and go fuck a lesbian

Sometimes I stare at the bed
Knowing that no one's there
Something is telling me
That you feel the way I do
I dream of you all the time
Wishing that you were mine
I'm feeling so empty
Hoping you'll think of me
I need ya here tonight
[Chorus]
If I'm all alone
And you're all alone
Ain't nothing wrong
Having someone to hold
Oh, your tender touch
It means so much
It feels so right having someone to hold
It's very plain to see
I want you next to me
Give me your hand and
I'll try to understand
Girl I love you so
I can't let you go
Ain't nothing wrong with having someone to hold
Every now and then
I get to wondering
Are you with someone else
Or could you be by yourself
I turn on the TV
It's a picture of you and me
And I'm going crazy
Cause I miss my baby
I want you here tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
Baby, I love you so
And everything that you have done for me
No one has ever done before
And I'll never let you go
You mean the world to me
And baby the way you make me feel
Whenever I'm alone with you
Is irreplaceable
(Girl, there ain't nothing wrong so)
[Chorus]

Yeah yeah yeah
Say I don't care
I throw my hands in the air
I do it my way
I got no fear
Say I do what I want
Yeah I do what I want
You know I do what I want
I do what I want
Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Wild out stylin', I came to get down
And ya can't believe that FM on your dial
Hatin' on my crown 'cause the kicks stand out
When I kick the raw sound, then I make ya walk it out
Yeah critics try to test the best
I'm flippin' nose at shows 'cause i dress the best
FM on my chest, I rep the west
I'm world-wide, haters on house arrest
So when they tell ya how to do yo thang
You tell em step off 'cause the kicks so clean
I got no shame, I'm proud like a champion
I'm at the top of my game
Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yo, why you on my grill?
Homie fall back, just tryna chill with my Pontiac
Pick up a girl, maybe pick two
Im'ma big deal and I'm from a sick crew
It's the 18, we get the job done
It's 24/7 always on the run
Reppin' LA, that's where I'm from
Aim for the top, coming straight from the slums
Sick of the hate that's pointed to my dome
Quiet all the yappin', you fake Jenny Jones
How can you doubt me, I got to much passion
Reppin' FM till they drop in my casket
Try and tell me this and try and tell me that
But I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It goes in one eat and right out the other
'cause I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't
Yeah yeah yeah
Say I don't care
I throw my hands in the air
I do it my way
I got no fear
Say I do what I want
Yeah I do what I want
You know I do what I want
I do what I want
Workin' 9 to 9, I'm just tryna sing it live
Is it really any different that I'm wokin' on my rhymes
'cause my swagger to sick, all my flows too cool
Or the fact that I wear my shades in the early afternoon
Really buggin you? Sorry I didn't know about the rules
But I'm pretty sure that mama didn't raise no fool
You can say watchu will, but it ain't no use
Im'ma still low ride, throwin' up the double u
I got my vans on they cost a billion
I do what I want and there ain't no stealin'
Flow so cold 'cause ya boy is chillin'
Haters can't fight the feelin'
Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah yeah yeah
Say I don't care
I throw my hands in the air
I do it my way
I got no fear
Say I do what I want
Yeah I do what I want
You know I do what I want
I do what I want

i like the strawberry sauce on my cheesecake
i dip around the lake when its quite like a wake
and when it comes again i try to crack it like a safe
the sun goes down and disappear in the shadows
or you reappear on the streets of seattle

Mama ain't got no cash, daddy ain't got no doe
So daddy went to my mama and started pimpin' that hoe
Man it's hard times, niggas ain't got shit
Nothin' but billy clubs to they head and they ass kicked
Heroin in they vein, cocaine up in they brain
Man what you expect, America gave us pain
So fuck it, now we thugs, ? mean drugs
And takin mean mugs, and fill 'em with those slugs
I gave up fake gods, and Jesus don't look like us
Why y'all think we gon' kill and just don't give a hot fuck
Devil that's how you made us, ? us up in the pen
Man we came out blind, that's why we goin back in
But God, I'mma teach 'em, reach 'em up in these streets
Bush, I'm runnin' up in this shit like a track meet
You murdered, up in Texas where killin' is such a sin
The first month you in office you started killin' again
But shit, we just some niggas and that's how the game go
Y'all took us up out the state moved us straight out to Death Row
Y'all may of, made us slaves but never make us your hoe
God, you my pimp so let's start exposin' these hoes
y'all judges some weak pussies, y'all preaches some rapin' fags
These people that made us slaves, these niggas wavin' they flags
America ain't shit but home of the hot lick
They hang us all by rope, then laugh and cut off our dick
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
All the things we been talkin' bout
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
All the things we been talkin' bout
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi
Have y'all niggas ever thought about
All the things we been talkin' bout
Down in Mississippi

Its a Ghetto Fairy Tale... Ya ya ya ya
It was two weeks before my son's birthday,
The "DT's" were ringing my bell.
(ma'am we need to ask you a question)
They told me the raid, would go down any day,
And if I was smart I wouldn't tell.
It was all over him ya'll, my boyfriend the criminal.
He was caught up in the game, and the F.B.I. warned,
If I didn't go along,
They'd make sure I never saw my son or my boyfriend again.
(Remember This.. u are a convicted felony on probation)
But how could i just turn him in?
(ma'am if you dont help us you'll never see your son again.. trust me)
He would always tell me
I know you're afraid,
But you can't leave me now.
Lean on my shoulder,
Soon it'll be over.
I'm try'na build our future,
I'm doing this for us.
Your're the only one I love,
The only one I trust.
I'd been with him for about, four years,
And I swear he gave me anything that I could dream.
But the life that he lived was a nightmare, I swear, it wasn't clean.
He was blinded, by the cream.
All the murderous capaz, the trip to Las Vegas,
Making millions from paper blood-stained.
Stuck in my head like a song,
I saw every sin, I knew every wrong,
And if I didn't go along, I'd never see my family again.
(so whats it goin to be?..
i know my rights!
one phone call from me and your son is going to a foster home answer the question!
i dont have ta answer shit!)
He would always tell me.
I know you're afraid,
But you can't leave me now.
Lean on my shoulder,
Soon it'll be over.
I'm try'na build our future,
I'm doing this for us.
Your're the only one I love,
The only one I trust.
It was saturday evenin
we were home watchin t.v., he looked in my eyes, i wanted to cry
my son ran to hug him and kissed him goodnight
How could i do this? pledged to do this but i knew he would die!
The FEDs rushed the door. yelled "everyone on the floor"
my man pulled his "9" n started to Fire
he was a soldier of course, and war he couldent win
but without him i coulednt live, so i stood by his side...
and went down with him... :(
OOOOOOHHHH, no no no no, no no no no, ya ya ya ya, ohhhh.. wooooohhh
he would always tell me...
(rep. 2x)
I know you're afraid,
But you can't leave me now.
Lean on my shoulder,
Soon it'll be over.
I'm try'na build our future,
I'm doing this for us.
Your're the only one I love,
The only one I trust.
Im sorry... im so sorry

Three minutes my nigga, y'all know what it is
JUST BLAZE!
("No more fun and games!")
Gangsta gangsta, that's already evident
Nigga Witta Attitude, check check my residence
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, homey that's irrelevant
I with the D.O.C., there's nobody better than
The West coast felon when he on that lowrider bike pedallin
Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin it
I'm wit'cha homey Doc Dre on the television
While these niggas movin peanuts like a elephant
I move cars like spinnin rims
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem
Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia Keys dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
Cause ain't ("No more fun and games!")
Gangsta, gangsta! ("That's what they're yellin")
("It's not about a salary, it's all about reality")
("I ain't gotta tell you this but one mo' time..")
("Leroy!") (".. now pay attention")
I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin Detox, this his only run
Mase comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryin to play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be
Gangsta, gangsta! ("That's what they're yellin")
("It's not about a salary, it's all about reality")
("Nigga I just came out the hole, I done did my time")
("Nigga what you know about time?")
I've been rappin for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, "Wanksta" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew where Mike lived
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for them Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah

Dont need no ticket
Dont need no reservation
I've got my table set for two
Don't bring no money
Just your imagination
for all the things that we can do
I skip my entree
n' stick to table water
I've got my main course for dessert
I dim the lights
the DJ can take a hike
cause we dont need no chaprone tonight
Cause all i want is what you got
All seats taken
And all i dont is what you're not

Loaded and cocked for any hard rock

Keep your face down as I take your pound
Don't let me see nobody get up, just hug the ground
Stay still and don't make a sound

Verse 1 - Sleep
Blue skies Im dreamin where all my troubles leave and
Can shape the puddy mountains that surrounds my private Eden
the window pane framed my innocence and I dreamt
what was on the other side of the mountain where brand new begins.
The lightning was an Omen for the path that would be chosen
for the monsoons that would come soon on my quest to know this
Where new windows opened then closed, to catch my frozen breath
and I scratched a slot to see, but its out of focus.
Whats left of me feels hopeless sitting next to me is the notion
that Ill never make it In front of me jaded behind me smoke and mirrors
and the years it took to get this lost
and Ill toss them all away to find the pieces of my heart.
Chorus
Im so far away
from the place where I used to dream
the moonlit window seal that framed the smile
when it was new to me.
But slowly, its grown old to me.
This cold and lonely road.
Still Im not where I want to go,
But Im so so close.
And Im running out of hope
And I dont know how long I can hold.
Verse 2 - JM
Hold on baby! Your love is the elixir to sustain me
You can save me or I can go crazy!

Getting high/ just Wishing you would die

Gut busting, but nothing, fists clenching

Yo the brooklyn bridge is gonna collapse y'know?
Yo this wyclef jean and the refugee all-stars up in here
Yo what's this I hear about the police in brooklyn?
Turn this jam up, yo, yo
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay
I want the whole world to hear this joint right here, yo
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay
You asked for it buddy, here it comes
One two, watch out for the man in blue
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore
Five six, you're beating us with nightsticks
Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your chin
*repeat 2x: first time "ah"; second time "once I leave the pen"*
I'm from a land of black bats, alley rats and cats
Scratch up my car, set me up for the carjack
Under pressure, I gotta leave the gat
Two straps, a total of sixteen caps
Say something positive? no positivity
More positivity, more positivity brutality
Thugs get angry, the violence increase
You want peace, make wyclef chief of police
Riding through the hood, it's the same ol story
It's either you play ball or you drug dealy dealy
Standin on the block when the spot get hot
Guaranteed to get set up, by a crooked cop
So I'm sittin back, rhymin on instrumentals
Anything I touch, it turns monumental
Me and jerry wonder, we keep it credible
For the streets, at the same time, we gotta eat
When we commercialize it's to enterprise
We guarantee to sell a hundred mil before we die
But jerry is broke, that's the situation
Nine-seven, it's like no more eviction
No more war milk, no more government cheese
Police keep on shootin at our bulletproof bentley
Yo this the type of jam that be getting no airplay
The brooklyn bridge about to collapse, apocalypse
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay
The ghettoes are fed up, we got the arms in the air
One two, watch out for the man in blue
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore
Five six, you're beating us with nightsticks
Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your chin
[manhunt]
Yo bust this
Forty caliber, seventeen through your character
Waterworld's world, underwater, sub mariner
Derringer, twenty-two one in the challenger
Seven, four-eight, 23rd on the calender
My word verses, burst raps you rap nervous
It's worthless, you get smashed up, on the surface
Projectile, my forty-four style, blood on silver
The red ripper, fill up the resevoir nigga
Armageddeon, you smack dead on, a world crisis
The nicest, for sixteen bars, of preciseness
[wyclef]
One two, watch out for the man in blue
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore
Five six, you're sticking me with nightsticks
Seven eight, I'm forced to call canibus
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin
[canibus]
You got a gat nigga, use it, go 'head pull it
Scientists got raw footage of me dodgin bullets
I walk the streets with heat, three biscuits
Outnumberin niggaz twin glocks with triplets
When I spit shit I lace it, you get punched in face with
Puncutations of five-knuckle phrases
I assure you the vocalist standin before you
Will destroy you with temperatures hot enough to flamebroil you
My tongue moves much faster than yours do
Every three thousand styles I change my voiceboxes oil
Embarass you in front of your crew to annoy you
If you know some chicks that suck a good dick, then I'll employ you
To this hip-hop shit, canibus stays loyal
That's why every killuminati I battle somebody for you
I'm warnin you, me versus you, I hurt you
My balance enables me to squaredance in a circle
Your head'll spin so fast you'll catch whiplash
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass
Make your hard drive crash to c colon backslash (c:/)
Go back to the roots and reprogram your wack ass, nigga
[wyclef]
One two, watch out for the man in blue
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore
Five six, you're sticking us with nightsticks
Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin
Where brooklyn at? where brooklyn at? (right here, right here)
A-ight? new jersey in the house...
The people versus gestapo, what what
Yo, there'll be no sequel to this revolution

CHORUS (Jimmy Cozier)
When love, takes me over
Its paradise
When love, takes me over
It's always nice
VERSE
Touch pon di ends
And a incense, herbs and oils
Scrapbook newspaper
Clippings and files
A view of di countryside
Remind me of nine miles
Where di trees are green
And di people smile
After few water crackers
And some warm milo tea
Rub massage home made
Coco butter skin cream
Interior design of
Ights gold and green
And the vibes are pure
And the thoughts are clean
She collect her own
Dividends weekly
So mi know ah no money
Mek she seek me
Cool me down
And tie mi knotty dem neatly
Draw close
While whispering sweetly
Mi teach her each and everytime
That she link me
We haffi bun
A five bills bag a stinky
True she roots and culture
She win me
I even had to
Introduce her to Cindy
CHORUS
VERSE (Mr. Cheeks)
VERSE
Well I was sitting
By an open fire place
In my flavorite dungarees
I play a few strums
Upon my guitar
And It sounds so good to me
Big skunky blunt a blaze
And plus
My flavorite stooks beside me
I glance over
Just so I could see her
But my locks got in the way
Cool breeze a blow
Through the weeping willow
She always leave
A fragrance on my pillow
When I'm ready
She will always follow
Me to the place of
My old sleepy hollow
Soft silky voice is
So sacred and hollow
Cause out spoken noisy
Streams run shallow
Reach to the stars
When I launch the Apollo
Could a land up ah Sao Paulo
CHORUS

Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song
This is not a love song, song
Cuz I keep try to function
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
Gotta juggin' on me, I don't wanna back down
Your body do me like I'm bumping like that
Big boss need a hash tag
Surely I can show you, know how to get the top down
Now bring it back, take it low
Now bring it back, now take it low
Can I get it, can I get it
I'm a tough boss, ht 'em with a though source
Top, she can hide, took her to the top floor
Bubble up ? like I'm James Bond
King I am feeling in my kingdom
Surely on me, talking like she own me
Make a right move, her body linking over
I'mma down but she's ready for the ?
This is not a love song baby
Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song
I can't get a love song
This is not a love song
Cuz I keep try to function
This is not a love song
Ooh this is not a love song
All the models in the club well on my glow
How they dancing like is young with his polo
We, shout it out like they show low
In the shave I will bring all along girl
Bring it back, now take it that
I never got, well I'm not
Gotta seek it, can I get it?
When it come to the game I play it like none
Please tell your shit, I'm Mister Siaghan
Shut it and hit it like some cuz we living like we wanna dive young
Shout out to my DJ, put that shit on replay
Now I gotta, now I gotta dancing in the beat
Come and get your present, get to know me better
First name John, last me forever
Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song
This is not a love song, song
Cuz I keep try to function
This is not a love song
But this is not a love song

Chorus: (Sung by a woman)
We'll never part (through) sickness and health
You are my heart
I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep
It'll be all right I'll be there for you
If you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you......
If you tell me all your secrets
Verse 1: Canibus
Aye Yo!
Boy meets girl, boy really likes her
Boy loses contact with girl but he finds her
Girl has no clue that boy is a liar, and he has no honor.
So she dates him regardless, 'cause she thought he was harmless
And he had her believing' he was the man she wanted.
To spend the rest of her life with. The words "I love you" are
Priceless, unpredictable like rollin' dices.
Nonetheless in spite of the fright
And repercussions you might get people still risk they necks.
Of course it's nice the feelin' of courtship
Roses and stuff, women never get it often enough.
And the reason people love they mother so much
Besides the fact she carried you for nine months, is trust.
It's a five letter word, that should only occur between him and her
Before the bees and the birds...word!
Chorus 1x
Verse 2: Canibus
Aye Yo!
I heard a soft moan in the middle of March,
Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart.
On your mark, get set, GO!
I was off, flagella was my propellor wiggling back and forth.
Then I set across for the border, Mother Nature's ?comma?
Calling me to the rock of Gibraltar.
The compitition tried to be smart but I was smarter.
My competitors was swimmin' fast so I swam harder.
Submerged in water, prayin' to my heavenly father
If I don't make it through I'm a "goner."
Screaming out death before this honor, because I'm awesomely
Stronger, my stamina last longer. I was destined to be a son
Instead of a daughter, XY is the male chromosomal order.
One'll stay alive, and survive, the rest'll be dead
'cause I'm a be the one to fertilize that egg (echoes out)
Chorus: (Sung by a woman)
In the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you....
If you tell me all your secrets.
Verse 3: Canibus
Aye Yo!
Mommy I'm up in your stomach, buggin'. Whenever you
Rub it, I love it like a comforters covers you warm as a oven.
Your husband...stubborn, how can you love him.
Smokin' cigarettes by the dozen when he knows that I'm comin'.
Bad move, you hopin' that daddy improves.
Knowin' in your heart that's bull, because he's too cruel.
You've been abused, used, you got wounds and scars.
Stick with your mind not with your heart, let's go to grandma's.
Terminate the lease call the landlord. Give your job two weeks notice
Pack up the car, and go to New York. What part.
They got a little borough called The Bronx, Mom..
And I heard that's where hip-hop is gonna start.
Yeah, I think we need to be right there. Four months
In your stomach and I already chose a career. When you cry
I hear, and I wish I could dry your tears, but I can't 'cause I'm stuck
in here.
Five months from being able to lay against your chest
I can't even hold you in my arms, 'cause they ain't developed yet.
But I swear to you, as the God Almighty Truth
I'm a be there for you
I'm a be there for you.
Chorus to fade

California love!
California, knows how to party
California, knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin!
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens,
Lean mean money-makin-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre putting it down for
Californ-I-a
California (California) knows how to party (knows how to party!)
California (west coast) knows how to party (yes they do)(that's right)
In the city of L.A. (city of L.A.)
In the city of good ol' Watts (good ol' Watts)
In the city, the city of Compton (city of Compton)
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin! (come on, come on, come on)
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it, shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby (that's right, uh)
Shake it shake it baby baby, shake it shake it mama, shake it Cali
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreaming
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side player where cowards die
And its all war
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballies (that's right, uh)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sactown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Cali-love
California (California) knows how to party
California, knows how to party (come on baby)
In the city (south-central) of L.A. (L.A.)
In the city of good ol' Watts (uh, that's right)
In the city, the city of Compton (yup, yup)
We keep it rocking! We keep it rocking! (yeah, yeah now make it shake, c'mon)
Shake it shake it baby (uh)
Shake it shake it, shake it baby (yeah)
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali (shake it Cali)
Shake it shake it baby (shake it Cali)
Shake it shake it, shake it shake it mama (west-coast) shake it Cali
Uh, yeah, uh, long beach in the house, uh yeah
Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
Frisko, Frisko
Hey, you know LA is up in this
Pasadena, where you at
Yeah, Inglewood, Inglewood always up to no good
(Tupac) Even Hollywood trying to get a piece baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where ya at? yeah
Throw it up y'all, throw it up, Throw it up (I can't see ya!)
California Love!
Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know it's the best side

I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner trying to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion
Its all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
'Cause I think I started hallucinating
'Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I can do is follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like I'm Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya
Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, I'm not in the mood so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke
I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
To replace next up Veronica's boobs
And uhh, paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for or
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen
Thought I'd give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps
Relapsing under that
Well that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like its a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
'Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked, I'm coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
But that passionate hunger's back
The fantastic juggling act
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics
But in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped the duffel bag to my back
And stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back lash
On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal
And just asked him to come crash
And I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
And ceramic construction hat
Rubbed my magic mushroom tat
Fell off then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas, lungs collapse
And that's more likely than finding someone that's
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"You're top ten ain't cha?" stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
I came to fuck with your occupation
You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
Dug him up Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles baking
Fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
Since they all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Doctor Dre
So then what does it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption
Here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
Till I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm fucked up with constipation
That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that's
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen

[puff daddy]
I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?
[mase]
Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope harlem will blow up be my last request
[jadakiss]
Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a nantucket
Then go get a jar from branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the eddie bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what
[black rob]
You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the tavern on the green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter
[1] - if you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?
If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?
[sheek]
What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit tnt
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me
[styles]
If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds
[dmx]
Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but i'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', i'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on wall street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame
[repeat 1 until fade]

If you know God is working in your life
Shout it
If you know God then you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you know God and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know God then just jump and shout it
Shout it
Time wastin'
All things that I'm chasin'
Eatin' but don't like what I'm tastin'
Every day I'm gonna want it
104
Have me wondering
But then I wanted it for
Keep down the roll pass, self-destructive
What's my fuck shit?
You know I am for something
Lord let me know if my suffering will be in vain
Lord how much longer will it be?
Lord how much longer will it stay?
Lord how much loner won't the pain let me feel good?
If you don't got what they mean
Then shout it
If you know that you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you don't got it and you know what's it like
Shout it
If you know about it just shout it
Shout it
I'm a try harder
I know the only way to make it
Is going to my father
Stay right beside me
Where is right and love
And for me
They will tie me up
I'm lie top on, top on
She was right on time
But I was so happy to see her
It had me crying
You enjoy it
No you got to save you, save you
Starting to be changing
Never hate you
Look you wanna shout more?
I think you wanna live more
You can do it out more
If you wanna dip more
This is what I live for
This is what I do
It ain't for me
It's for you
If you don't got what they mean
Then shout it
If you know that you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you don't got it and you know what's it like
Shout it
If you know about it just shout it

If you know that you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you don't got it and you know what's it like
Shout it
If you know about it just shout it
Shout it
Where's your head at?
We know where it is

I was sold to slavery
My brothers moved by jealousy
Father's favor to a well
My master's favor to a prison cell
But still Your kindness stayed with me
I knew someday that You would set me free
Through it all Your grace was shown
My confidence in You has only grown
(Chorus)
When I pray
I feel that You are near
When I cry
You're there to dry my tears
When I shout
You're the only One who really hears
When I pray
I was in the field the day
That Your anointing came my way
Through the lion
Through the bear
From the giant to the Kingdom's chair
From deadly spears of jealousy
To weaknesses exposed of me
Cast me not away from Thee
Create a brand-new heart in me
Praying in Gethsemane
I know You saw the ones like me
The cross You freely chose to bear
It was my sin that nailed You there
Now You mediate for me
So I can pray confidently
When I pray

The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The sun may never rise again
The question ain't if but when
The sea will mourn, the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again
The silent war has begun
We're staring down loaded gun
No refuge found no solid ground
Assuming race can't be won
Don't wait to say goodbye, you're running out of time
Whatever you believe, it's easy to see
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode
The whole world, the whole world
The whole world, the whole world
The future is a dying art
Laying in a ditch in the dark
I need you here but all I hear
Is the beating of a broken heart
Don't wait to say goodbye, you're running out of time
Whatever you believe, it's easy to see

Aceyalone (spoken):
Excuse me, sir
Whose microphone is this?
"I think it's that guy over there"
This guy over here?
Excuse me, is this you're microphone?
"yeah"
I mean, I've seen a lot of mcs on this microphone
But this is your microphone, right?
"yeah, yeah, it's mine"
I mean, what I really wanted to know is,
Is this really, I mean really, really your microphone?
Aceyalone:
This microphone is mine
Whenever I hold it, I transcend time
This microphone allows me to shine
Bright, with the light
This microphone is my weapon
This microphone is my confidant
This microphone is my magical wand
To make all y'all, all y'all
I mean all y'all respond
Yeeeaahh
This microphone takes me one step beyond
This microphone helped to save my soul
This microphone helped to pave this road
They say "what do you do? "
I say "what do you mean? "
They say "what's your profession"
I say "microphone fiend"
This microphone is the one and only thing
That lets me live, lets me open up and give
This microphone helps me not be broke
This microphone helped to feed my folks
This microphone always keeps me awoke
I tell the truth and I don't tell jokes
Now check it
I tell the truth and I don't tell jokes
Now check it out
This microphone, when it's in my hand
With or without a band, or a mic stand
I command, even if it's static-why and distorted
I still gotta automatically record it
This microphone, connected to the power supply
My thoughts blossom, like flowers in the sky
This microphone...
P.e.a.c.e.:
Deactivate factor
We fracture microphones
Is that a microphone? a microphone?
Go on and roam, take out loans
If you wanna own, backpains, swallow it down
Live from la, it's peace and aceyalone
Speak rhymes over cell phones
Now I know you not gonna sing that song
Why? 'cause ain't nobody gonna understand that, homes
This fool is the most assured ? ? and thongs on
Down car phones, somebody passed out
With the car door opened, assed out
Run up on him, see what he got
A nice box of microphones, microphones
These are the same ones being slung to the clones
Oooh, another busted busta getting broke by the microphone..
Acey (spoken):
Okay, now I see you proved you're point
So now, I do have another question for you
"what's that? ", "why so many questions, man? "
I want to know, who's style is that?

[Chorus:]
Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it`s time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
I`m one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don`t understand, see I`m a grown man
And I stand 5`8" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I`m like the sergeant
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I`ll put you down about the brothers who think they`re the boss
Think they`re getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain`t the way to go out
Even take their boys with `em cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They`re like crying like weeping, want to call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who`s to judge when you`re trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you`re hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!
Like I said I`m an ill kid, so never dare test me
They want to arrest me 'cause i`m causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma` tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it`s a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There`s another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He`d pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn`t give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There`d be no hesitation he`d just shoot
It`s like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it`s reality and you don`t see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he`s got a rifle to stifle
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who`s been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he`s out the joint and he`s like flippin` on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin` their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there`s a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I`m meaning
'cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I`m like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can`t hang ha
You`re making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect
[Chorus:] repeat
Yo money don`t front you know you blew your chance
And now it`s my turn so Imma` take command
'cause I`m like the one who`s got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I`m like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now I`m past the point and I ain`t gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain`t really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I`m living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!

"If you like the sound of what you've heard so far.."
[KRS-One]
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music..
You're tuned into that easy listening sound
with a cap and gown, not a CROWN
No glitter, no makeup
Just smashin lyrics, that make up
the be	, D, and the P
You pay for the hits, the advice is free
In this industry, we gotta grow
Commercial some go, but, why'know
just as important as they are
so is the underground superstar (like me)
You gotta ask yourself one question
Do I speak facts, or do I start guessin?
Learn the lesson, before you plan your career
Commercial or underground, where
do you fit, cause BOTH sides write hits
And all is rap, I'll admit
But what I've come to EXPLAIN
is that these people LOVE to play a game
They want to make it seem like YOU'RE WRONG
for writin the reality song
(Don't touch those issues, don't talk about dat
We don't take knowledge rap)
What? They want you on their bases
Cause if you bring out the brown, you're racist
But if you bring out the pink, well wait, it's OK
Yeah, they won't stop it
I guess it's alright to act demonic
I guess it's alright to act demonic
But that's another chapter, in another book
I've come to show a different look
And that look is the WHOLE of rap
Not just the commercial pap
but the UNDERGROUND, that RAW ghetto sound
from which rap music was found
So you can't deny it, you cannot refuse it
I'll be rockin that GHETTO MUSIC
People keep tellin me, "Kris! You need more radio
Yeah man, that's the way to go!
You gotta be like so-and-so to go platinum,"
then I attack em!
I rhyme for the ghetto, I teach the ghetto
I cannot let go, change up? Heck no
In the ghetto, I stay mellow
We're in effect yo, ready, set, go
FRESH, for nineteen eighty-nine you suckers
Peace to P.E., and the Jungle Brothers
Others, have come, to master the art
They start, with heart, then fall apart
Like a dart I shoot for one target (BO BO)
Ghetto music, yeah they'll never chart it
Cause now in eighty-nine, the purpose of a rhyme
is to strengthen and uplift the mind
Although I'll achieve and achieve and achieve
it's simple, I'll never leave
Cause every time you front for respect you LOSE it
I'll rock GHETTO MUSIC
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music..

[50 Cent]
Yeah, F-50
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye
As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high (yeah)
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye
[Verse 1 - Tony Yayo]
740 I, with the brand new shake (uh huh)
Got me pissin' on hoes like the R. Kelly tape
If you see me in the club, nothin' but Cris poppin' (yeah)
See me in court, my lawyers plea bargainin' (woo)
Tryin' to turn a 3 to 6, to a 2 to 4 (uh huh)
Or 1 to 3, for an extra G
RIP to Etho, I miss Hevo
When I die, I hope heaven look like the ghetto (yeah)
Picture me trick, and take a loss
I'm cheap like the Chinese man with duck sauce
This Tony homey, I walk around with a big chrome
9 L's will hit ya passenger, hit ya driver
G-Unit, you don't know a fuckin' clique liver
(You heard my nigga, you don't know a fuckin' clique liver)
[Chorus]
As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die (yeah)
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high (uh huh)
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye (eye)
As times go by, I twist a lot
Fuck with me and my niggas, somebody gonna die
You think I'm all poinry, cause you see me gettin' high
But my knife, I'll have yo ass seein' out one eye
[Verse 2 - Tony Yayo]
I never mix money and product with my friends (uh huh)
These chips, make relationships come to an end (what)
I pull the graveyard shift, gettin' money non-stop (uh huh)
And been on the block, ever since bunny tops (c'mon)
250 grizzies, scrape the plate (scrape that plate)
Got me on 750's straight from the plate (straight from the plate)
You can call on your soldiers, call your recruits (uh huh)
I do you dirty like Raheem did Dirty is "Juice" (Juice)
Allow myself, to introduce myself
This is Tony, the talk of New York, I'm holdin' the belt
I got thug in my blood (blood), game like a pimp (pimp)
And wrote my first verse, takin' baths in the sink (yeah)
And yo I fear no man son, I never heard of a fair one
Never gotta borrow a handgun
Niggas on the street, gettin' smoked like bran son
So I stay dirty like "Sanford and Son" (yeah)
Groupies gossipin' stay runnin' their lips (woo)
Cause they seen the Gucci seats in the 6 (uh huh)
And seen the Fendi grips on the four fifth (what)
Shit, I sell bricks, shit, I sell shit on a stick (stick)
Enough of the talkin', let's take it to the valance (uh huh)
The New York streets, will leave you physically challenged (challenged)
Don't be surprised, If I spit at you
Then come to your wake, and serve fiends at your funeral
Our bread is goin' towards a brick of dope
Cause I've been goin' hand and hand since "Different Strokes"
I'm a 50, an eighth, you a half a blunt
You the nigga in the mirror that practice stunts
WHAT!

Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Why'know how we swing this shit, look
By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin is
I changed gears but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
Not if they got niggas, doughboys and hot niggas
Who mighta shot niggas but only by strugglin'
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin' past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat, don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece chief
No grief niggas here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside exposed to the streets nigga
I changed gears but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number one in the nation
I fucked the world, the judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
Gimmie mine, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch, 'cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries bleed
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man
I changed gears but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up (You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
I changed gears but I'm still the same old rider
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggas don't know me
Why'all know that nigga on the rap song
Why'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz,
You fuckin with a changed man
You fuckin with a changed man
I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin with a changed man
Changed man

Hold on
Yeah it's gonna be alright, don't trip baby
It'll get better
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong
I know them ain't tears comin down your face
When it's on it's on but
Wipe your eyes
Hold on, be strong
In this world
When it's on it's on but
Only the strong survive y'know
Hold on, be strong
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
When it's on it's on but
Welfare
Hold on, be strong
AIDS, earthquakes
Cause when it's on it's on but
Muggings, carjackings
Hold on, and be strong
Yeah we got problems
'Cause when it's on it's on but
But believe me when I tell you
Hold on, and be strong
Things always get better
Cause when it's on it's on but
God don't like ugly
Hold on, and be strong
And God don't like no quitters
Cause when it's on it's on but
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
Hold on, and be strong
God bless the child that can hold his own
'Cause when it's on it's on but
Y'know?
Hold on, and be strong
You got to stand strong
Cause when it's on it's on but
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
Hold on, and be strong
You stand there to they face
Cause when it's on it's on but
Tell em hold on, and be strong
Hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
'Cause when it's on it's on but
Hmmm
Hold on, and be strong
This here is black main
Cause when it's on it's on but
If you don't never leave nothin, learn one thing
Hold on, and be strong
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Hold on
Thug, for life feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin, hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic

This goes out to everybody in the whole wide world
Fresh coast gettin' rowdy

We showin' out
And we about to tell y'all what it's all about
So as I ease back from this microphone
I'm a let it go to Aceyalone
Little somethin' like this
Check it out people whoever you are
Whoever you with where ever you at
Wherever you from where ever you goin'
I'm 'on' put you up on this here cause youse not knowin'
Let me take a little time out to holler at ya
You go get your partners cause I'm fit to drop a bug in your ear
See what we have here is uh ruh yeah
The helluva ill type shit you fear
That's cause we knowin' but you don't really know
Cause every nigga that call himself rappin' don't really flow
Really though
I'll open up my mind and take you places you can't go
I woulda been a catcher behind the plate but you can't throw
Cause you don't know but you don't hear me though
Yo check this out
My body collapse in the raps
And snaps like a wild mongoose in a trap
Better watch your table manners boy and give me room
I'm servin' shit constantly tune
And laughin' like a ticklish baboon
On the way to the moon w/a stick and a broom
And the cream of the crop hip hop cause we be
Crackin' the whip on the poppin' be pimpin' the whole punk block
At the junk shop
Fellowship shop shape sha-bob-a-lob-a
Sloppin' the side of a pig pen with the grape ape baboon
Wanna see this jack o'lantern panted planted ball that don't bounce
Against the wall like you think
Well thanks but no thanks
Pranks or no pranks
I'm a let 'em know they can't rank bank or no bank
I would if I could but I can't so I ain't gon' stop flowin'
But I'll put you up on this here cause you's not knowin'
Damn Acey flay me he kinda hittin' I ain't bullshittin'
Written into the Fellowship you know freestyle
Meanwhile back at the hall of justice
Abstract bust this this track ain't for suckers
Immediately exceeding the reality of normality
By radically and automatically startin' off rapidly
Rap w/me
Come on perk a little work a little
In the middle nuclei we are responding
Stimuli dim the lights
I gotta really grab you
Cause you just not knowin' about flowin' I can climax to
You rap too short too long too slow too fast
You lacks on point you wrong you won't last
I'm up on a good foot you're out on a bad note
I'm dope
Ice
Fresh
Automatic oh yes
Creatively talkin' about how I'm fadin' you vocally
Your mouth's not openin' man you just not knowin' damn
These niggas got me fucked up aw what up Abstract Rude
Rap dude ain't nobody fade the fresh coast
You know them Heavyweights you know what I'm sayin'
That Ganja K you know what I'm sayin'
That Dolla Holla comin' w/that Watts up you know what I'm sayin'
It's like I ain't even tryin' to understand why people comin' at me
W/that nonsense
They ain't knowin'
See I engineered it I geared it I steered it
I took it to the whole world and everybody cheered it
I hauled it I yes y'all'ed it and they feared it
I called it I outlawed it and they cleared it
Now I am I and it is it and that's that
But ain't that a bitch
It ain't shit
Think it ain't all that that they say
Forever and a day
To live and die in L.A
California u.s.a
But I am a universal soldier
Ok
Walkin' through the party tryin' to find my way
Bumped into my main man Ganjah K
I gave a nigga a pound and he lit up a j
I took a hit and a half and got high and a hey
My coconut was mellow but my vision was gray
Looked on the dance floor and I seen my DJ
Cool hands Kiilu Grand he knows what to play
So we headed for the booth to get the party on the way
Walkin' through the crowd I heard somebody say hey
It was Mikah 9 he said what up double A
Tryin' to make my pay tryin' not to stray
But you know my forte I let a sleepin' dog lay
We on that old missin' link
In between the baboon and the common man
They don't understand tho
They ain't even tryin' to know
Check this out
I and I echo with old sentiments
Rudimentary tenements
House reverberates
Richochets to small invertebrates
Even all these spineless jellyfish
Rhyme-less bass with no taste jazz
Enthusiastic spastic hemophiliacs
Memorabilia or acting siliac sense(less)milia
Minature expenditures
Spine tingling adventures
Keenly architechtures
Of a lecture
That blockade and bust dental caps and dentures
Hey! let's start a new business venture
No you're not dreaming i'll be the Pincher
The millimeter by millimeter Doberman Bull Mastiff mix
Where Rottweiler while a rhyme of
Graffiti traffic autobiographic
Ethnic cleansing benzing lacing
Culture oscars inch by inch Deans and Costners
Who foster my rhythmic memories
Collectible sacks of my Mossberg and telebeam
Scope enemies with enemas
I'm leaving them helpless and hopeless like the
Running victim that falls in the scary cinema
Huh huh it was like three black guys and they like had skills
Yeah skills
They were like kinda kinda funky and fresh and stuff
Yeah nigga you just not knowin'

Intro
My high hat connected to the snur drum
And my snur drum connected to the kick drum
And my kick drum connected to the beat drum
And my beat drum connected to the bass
Bridge
Imma see you when I see you when I'm riden through the hood
And if I don't say nothin homie know its all good
Cause my speaker steady bumpin and my trunk beat thumpin
Got a pocket full of dough and your whole block jumpin
Chorus (x 2)
I need my high hat
I need my kick drum

Outro (x 2)
High hat

[Intro: Bizzy]
Ha ha ha ha, and it's on
Once again it's on, Bizzy the Kid
The Midwest Cowboy, in the place to be
Holla at your boy
When I see-ee, I see-ee, who I be (who I be)
Ain't no adultery-dultery-dultery
And it damn sure ain't gon' be no blasphemy man, holla at me
[Bizzy Bone]
The valley of death, go peak in the shadows
and gallop to gallow, the way that we ride
Probably think that it's over the other side
baby divided go peek at the time
Reminded to open the people the blind, look at the duty
don't think that I look at the booty
From everything that I was listenin
rippin the tip of the dirty the mind
God, how could I know somethin?
You know that they tellin me I don't know nothin
They wanted the confident, competent never be pompous
The drama they given 'em dozen
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
Feelin the love and the beauty is real
The beautiful field, remember thou shalt not kill
Whenever you need me it's never exceedin
the beautiful lessons and beautiful blessings
And daily distressin, not here to impress 'em
I'm guessin the expression is plain as steel
Look at the metal, the metal, the metal
Now let me go grab it before we collide
The rhetoric, never be hesitant
Never my love, the Lord provides
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I am what I am, no adultery
And who I be when I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am, what I am, what I
Now come in the light, up out of the darkness
When I see-ee, I see-ee, no adultery
Remember the judge is hard
Put up the cards no disregard
[Bizzy Bone]
Yeah, come in the light up out of the darkness
fillin the void, and feelin my noise
And feelin the poise and feelin my boys
and feelin my voice and fillin my voids
Now come in the light, out of the darkness
fillin the void and feelin the noise
And feelin the poise and feelin my boys
now look at the temple the Philly
Look at him grow, look at the heart the mind the soul
We lovin the Lord, the Lord control
Get out of the knowledge
You know that the brain is just so slow
Plant the seeds, now all of the leaves
Remember the boss, remember believe
Remember the E, never no drugs
These liquid slugs, the love is from up above
No adultery callin me, baby we ain't fallin
Ain't know motherfuckin time for that
Now don't you abandon the rules, the rules is quickly focus
Say - all in, y'all in, all in, y'all in, y'all in
It's never the time to question, be attentive of the kindness
Never the blindness, when they find us spiritually fallin, and pausin
And brawlin, the birds keep on flyin, they're soarin
Whether it's - Saturn or Earth, God please prepare 'em (heh)
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I am what I am
Ain't no adultery-dultery-dultery
When I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am, what I am, what I am now
Ain't no adultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am
[Bizzy Bone]
Now flow with the movement, shakin the dust
Now look at the world, now look at the lust
I'm praisin the Lord in the name of the Father
the Son and the Holy Spirit plus
Flow with the movement, shakin the dust
Look at the world, and look at the lust
Praise the Lord in the name of the Father
the Son and the Holy Spirit plus
All of his saints, remember the war pain, givin the best we must
In the chastisement we must pay attention, that's what's up
So we tellin 'em baby to realize, the supreme almighty one
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit they feelin the rush
They feelin the drum, feelin Cheribrums
Feelin the love of the Lord is just, plush
And all of his workings and the twurkings of us
Remember the humbleness, of course we love to play putt-putt
And plantin the seeds in us, I'm finna sacrifice the love and the price
And the pipe, even the ice, up up, it's time to shine
Anytime, give me some wine, hahaha
What a collision, plowin the brain until it listen, no reminiscin
Of course I'm pissin I'm feelin pissed, pull out the whip list
And I've been bitten to the crispiness, drippin in the (haha) blood
This is the way we do when we them thugs, now find some religious ones
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And when I see-ee, I see-eeeeee
I am what I am, no adultery
When I see-ee, I see-eeeeee
I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
No adulteryyyyy, when I see-ee
I see-ee
[Bizzy Bone]
It's like the covenant, Moses made
With the Lord, and valuable lessons
And valuable jewels and the valuable rules
Praise God for everything
Lean back chillin, everybody wheelin and dealin
I don't have to work or make a million, million
Say, lean back chillin, everybody wheelin and dealin
I don't have to work or make a million
When I see-ee, ain't no adulteryyyyyy
When I see-ee, who I beeeee (no adultery)
When I see-ee, ain't no adulteryyyyyy
When I see-ee, who I beeeee

[ VERSE 1: MC Eiht ]
Don't nobody move, look at the Westside rulin
Never hot on the spot, cause Eiht keeps coolin
Doin my part, company charts, keepin it smart
Cause I give it my heart
Hard to understand why the fools keep trippin
Ladies on my jock, cause they want me to take a dip in
The ocean, geah, I cause commotion
Cancel your promotion, rub my lyrics in a potion
You laugh and it's good to be a teacher
To be sweated by a sucker who's weaker
Compton is the city, you want us to description
Eiht and Chill puttin suckers in a painfull position
So back up, slack up, before I just tack up
Any soft new jack, I just rack up
Throwin up the 'W' as I bail
Eiht is down as fuck - no, hard as hell
I give up nothin
[ VERSE 2: MC Eiht ]
I caught you, give up the confession
Eiht'll put your ass in a state of depression
You're kinda angry cause you're jocked by none
Try to voice your opinion, get smoked by the gun
Conflict you pick, you dick
Your strategy apalls with a subordinate clog
Despite the fact that I'm a criminal
Deliver the wild cause I'm the pinnacle
Just like a hologram to find out that you're hollow
MC Eiht is the leader you follow
Rhymes that flow, I never practice
Pray for help, but you suckers try to whack this
I stake my claim in the lyrics of humanity
Put me on a stand and I'm claimin insanity
The boy brutalize another soft-ass punk
Need to calm my being nervous, so I hit the blunt
I give up nothin
[ VERSE 3: MC Eiht ]
I gotta get you hot in the last verse
Complication of styles that are bust, it gets worse
Eiht, the rider, the partner, the back-up
Yo Slip, blow the beat, so we can stack-up
Suckers on the tip with a fool attitude
Slow your roll, don't make me get rude
Cause if I get rude, I proceed to start jackin
Never sweatin it, I'm known for packin
I see you're kinda nervous cause I'm representin Compton
What do you want, before I start stompin
Take a sec, so you can witness the sound
Never half-step in my path, because yo, I am down
I'm more than a MC, a assassin
In other words, Eiht is a black Charles Manson
Waxin up suckers with the lyrics of one breath
Kill em off till there's no one left
I give up nothin

I mean I mean
Y'all know what that is right?
I mean I mean
Y'all know what that is right?
Lil mama show me how you move it

Tags on the back of the lam say B Dub
Every night I'm in the streets and I'm G'd Up
5th album and I'm still banging out ya speakers
So so def nigga can't nobody see us
You know i keep it fresh when it comes to the fashion
At age 10 is when my mama heard the passion
I gotta stay stunting and i gotta keep flashing
7 figure checks is the only thing I'm cashing I'm stashing
Everything I get on it look tight
Ain't nothing like a hump when it jump and it shook right shook right
Ladies on a homie like I'm Denzel
Shirt off big chain rocking like I'm LL
Since 12 i done had a mill sitting in my garage
The Brazilian? girls coming giving me a massage
Before i was, people was treating me like a big star
Its a test if u wanna b in my entourage
Lil mama show me how you move it
Lil mama show me how you move it
Lil Lil Mama show me how you move it
Lil mama I wanna see ya
Lil mama show me how you move it

Yo, why you buggin?
I stick a 16 shot slug in your ear
Put it to my dick so you hear me comin
I. C.U. Critical, up on a stretcher
The 45 undresser, put on the pressure
You need a bulletproof overall suit to protect your neck up
You dealin then shuffle the deck up
Fuck the IRS, I'm the NRS
Nigga Revenue Service, talico inserter
Murder, a six letter word to convert a
Beef you better off flippin beef at Fat Burger
Yo Keith, pull out the burner
(He won't move any further)
Yeah, tannin your body more than white boy surfers
I carry tools like Sears Surplus
So when I spit you catch heart murmurs
Word, you sweeter than cupcakes
I concentrate to blow blocks where your crew pump weight
Each generation, rules the nation
Rock more spots than a hundred one dalmations
I'm not a hog I'm a big dog wit big balls
Lock it down like pit jaws to Crenshaw
Then why'all be like
He's jiggy like fat bitches wit cellulite
Chicken might dine like cops
First of the month these thugs
Will leave your bones in harmony from the slug
I beat pussy down when I'm smokin the la
Bitches leave the room screamin "Oh na na Oh na na"
E dog the mic demolitioner
The black superhero Def Squad's the clique, we rock shit
'Cause we flossiest
No thug cats show us often this
We the boss in this
Why think of double crossin this
Your first joint so wack it made me confused, forget who I be
I'll catch you eye then, ya heard
I live the life that's quite chill
On the hill wit a glass of water and 20 mil
Believe you me, E
I got a fresh flow I keep it blazed like dat fo' sho'
Some cats are sheisty, so I pack toast
My name ain't Next and, y'all Too Close
The rap emperor, scorchin hot
Be the temperature, let's see, think I'm funny
I make you laugh goodfella
I smack you down in front of your fans
Then watch the show, in the stands, nigga
Don't fuck around that's what I mean yo
Def Squad comin through again, El Nino
And why should we listen to you, anyway
You's a sucker MC wit a sucker DJ
I hit you with the all in the hammer
Cocksucker, niggas in DC say bammer
Master thrasher, on a binge for revenge
Make a hardcore nigga cry when I kill all his friends
And force destruction wit my coalition
Bang a nigga in the chest for frontin when he should be listenin
I comes through too true
Like a half pit, half man, HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!
Shut the fuck up, fuck you part two
I kill a rock and put a brick in the hospital

So light it up and pass the thang to me
I'm fresh off parole I could smoke a whole p
Can smell it in my clothes you can smell it in my seats
That's how a nigga rolls I was raised in them streets
I'm rollin up a sweet
I'm fillin' it with keef
I'm too high to talk bitch keep it real brief
If it ain't about money you don't even gotta speak

And nigga I'm a stunna, I got runnas
And we keep them shotguns like huntas
We smoke thunda, it put me under

And I stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the Maggie on me like Homer
And I'm too sick man I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, y'all blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around

Wired geechie suede, be right there
For this caravan, to relieve the bread
Harlem brook bx
Catch the character that snatched the goods
Huggy bear
Put me on to the will on it hit the gas
[Geechie Suede]
I got the wire
Ignored it, then poured it real slow in tekida's glass
Her radiance, radiance smilin', diamonds giorgio splash
The suede is aroused and caress and caribbean gems
The squeezin' of jizza is stimulated now on my bend
Lent symphonies, left a crystal rock i copped at tiffany's
She sniffed her arm, let her hair down and paced the balcony
I scraped the well
Dada have her on the score for years, but backed into hawk
Who pullin' shiest maneuvers on my camp, yeah
[Sonny Cheeba]
I don't understand, what the fuck is up, where my man
Eat a bowl of hot cock, now sonny cheeba volume one
Catch the mighty bullion cat, comin' out the door, what what
Arby's over top, mop 'em up, juke his monkey ass
Chorus
[Geechie Suede]
My huggy bear connect, connect
Me cautious, I enter a flamin' scorch, you by the door, moolah
All over the floor time to gather
As much as i can tryin' not to get blam off in a vicious
Get message to cheeba, in need of assistance right now
[Sonny Cheeba]
Then i get the rumble on the hip, i hit her fuzz
Gotta split, give my peeps who wants sober
Suede in town, bridge bound
See the shiesty eyes, filled in double o
This is it, through the corridor
Hit the floor, time y'all pack it up
What y'all laughin' at
Loose cannons, blaze my hathaway
Shake a leg, into the hallway, vision geechie suede
Coolie high cats
Back to back, bout to see the gates
Twist of fate, ease up into the room, let the guns play
[Geechie Suede]
Avoid the penal in jeopardy with no ammo to blow
But me and my a-see goin' out in less than zero, oh no
Now here come the crooks
Paradin' by storm with the luegers and oar
We conquer ground as usual
Lo empire can never fall
yeah
Chorus x 2

Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
Nigga never ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louis Vuitton, too
[Verse 1:]
Reality is wisdom, perspective
I like Horus, I don't like whores
Hindsight oh my I adore, for the time being yes I am yours
Drunk my card it's the ace of spades
And I hate to go away without getting this money made
But niggas be telling to believe in the reason to actor
Nigga lose his job, blame it all on bad luck
Known to coast and my eyes not open
The cold comes every season, trick
In the summer we smoke hunnids, my fall comes often evil shit
Just spews from my mind, I get confused all the time
My wall of space is confined, so you better elevate or lose time
Just lose time
[Hook]
[Verse 2:]
Shady, I don't play that
I be acting as if I'm a better man
And my mother to my brother from another
Boy oh yes you can
From my sisters I keep the shit right
And my mothers that kiss you good night
40 slugs in my liquor cup
Sick of shot and I pick you up
Bang bang from the same gang
Kick rocks if you can't hang
Lil nigga what you saying, mayne?
Roll up while the blames hang
Growing up was a plane, mayne
In the hood it's all good, made our own Hollywood
Took a picture the system my mental track me like a alien
I combine thoughts with divine course
And exhale exhaust from my skeleton
Tell her I won't appear again
Fuck that, if I'm going who will even care again?
Hate to be American, get away from experiments
Cause the truth in the pyramids
And we all fucking immigrants
And you're lying through your filaments
Lay back if you drink a bit
And indulge in this nigga shit
And that real nigga rhetoric
Dissolve all that simple shit, play a different game
It's too easy to be ignorant
Just lay back and think a bit
[Hook]
One time
Fuck all that other shit
[Bridge:]
One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo
Two times, two times for my ladies that are not a ho
One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo
[Outro:]
Angel but she want me for my peso
Telling other niggas she ain't never gonna wait
So by smashing the Range Rove'
Beat beat then I add her to the payroll
Smoke another doob with a cousin and a bro
But I won't say it slow
Misrepresenting the people who won't grow
So I carrying through the weapons that beat you through postal
Where we gon' go? Where we ever gon' go?
To the highest of the Horace eye
Fuck thoughts I am going 'til there's no reply
Flatbush Zombies
They try tah
South by southwest, all the way from Brooklyn

40 ounces of tha liccer
16 in tha clip
Crumble the herb
Roll a spliff
Bout to make ya brain split

Where we were, kinda thing, betcha crawl, all alone
Who am I?
Rec League, I ain't payin' to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah, I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah what you saying to it?
Old money look new money go do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ey
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her Booty)
What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke a niggas when they Black & Mild
So we acting out
Ok cool
Where we were, kinda thing, betcha crawl, all alone
Blue dream by the bouquet 'til I'm blue faced on a Tuesday
(Can I have some?)
#NiggasBeLike
Put a plus eighteen on that e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah nah, they can't hold me
June/July, drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like 2 Chainz
Blue Blood like he both gangs

[Featuring: Steve G. Lover]
[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party 'til the sun up
You ain't liking what we doing shut up
You ain't liking what we doing shut up
We got that extra life, n*gga one up
[Verse 1: Steve G. Lover]
F*ck the recession, I'ma keep this thing going
If you ain't know 'em, bet you probably still work for 'em
Chick from Bermuda, that's right I get my work foreign
They don't get paid, I got hard d*ck and purp for 'em
N*ggas out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for 'em
N*ggas wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for 'em
OG status, my job's got perks for 'em
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain't ever gotta search for 'em
You know what I'm doing, n*gga I'ma do things
Getting to the money, I guess I got a few things
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I'm Usain
Fresh from the haircut down to the shoestrings
Hoes talk about me, I'ma need a new name
Steve G the prince, I'm looking like the new king
All I do is win so who the hell's losing
[Hook (x2)]
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly
I heard you was so east side and that pussy's your Achilles
But really it's time to get up, smoking on that get up
Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit up
I'm feeling like a winner, my living be so easy
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Ukemi
So illy, I got espressos, mi mami give me besos
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low
D-Money get his name, these other n*ggas lame
These n*ggas used to hate me, I guess ain't nothing changed
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don't know where we going
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren
It's that city where Luda be, stunting was new to me
But now we killing paper, f*ck it I might just shoot a G
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it
Nobody need to see nobody leaking, believe me
[Hook (x2)]

(Blood spillin in the streets!)
(Blood spillin in the streets!) The what?
(Blood spillin in the streets!)
[Journalist]
Uhh, yo, yo, aiyyo
Aiyyo wit two precise niggaz, holdin the right biscuits
There'll be a lot of cats leakin out they life liquid
Niggaz who actin hard this ain't Columbia Pictures
when we throw two in yo' ass while you huggin on your mistress
From Philly, where cats quick to mute you at
Cuckoo cats, twist back your FUBU cap
Crucial black - two chicks to screw you at
Then they shove a poolstick where you doodoo at
While you checkin on your pagers, weapons in your faces
Shot blazin, cops section off the pavement
Hoppin out with gauges, prepare for the occasion
We throw about eight in, the house that you was raised in
Mouthin off fakin'll make you a loud patient
Achin, with your arms in a alcohol basin
And while your brain's achin I'ma have your dame slavin
Cocaine and apron, over a flame bakin
Chorus: Journalist + Canibus
[J]	Niggaz take it for granted -
until they layin dead on the granite
[C]	Innocent bystanders get shot by standin
[J]	Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon
[Both]	or why'all be checkin for leaks -
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin in the streets
[J]	Niggaz take it for granted -
until they layin dead on the granite
[C]	Innocent bystanders get shot by standin
[J]	Y'all shoulda ducked when why'all heard the cannon
now you layin deceased
[Both]	Niggas'll leave your blood spillin in the streets
[Canibus]
Can you feel it? Nothin can save ya
Cause this is the season of the infrared laser
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
is show you how you can get spotted by one too
Cause I don't give a fuck, I just cock back and bust
With more arms than an octopus, as if one gun wasn't enough
I fuck around and pull eight out
Blast your face off or blow your brains out
Nigga, I'll leave you laid out
Then I pull the gat in my waist out
Put it in your mouth
and keep squeezin til the whole clip is sprayed out
Take the gun in my ankle brace out; shoot you in the stomach
till I see the last meal you ate drain out
Your face look spaced out, I gut you like a trout
Scream my name out while I'm scrapin your rib cage out
Squeeze with the index, spray like a bottle of Windex
Bullets buzzin by your head like insects
From your head to your mid-sec'
And I ain't even shoot you in the legs or your limbs or your dick yet
Your masculinity is questionable, you probably a homosexual
Just the thought of havin a woman lay next to you
probably threatens you
You probably look at grapes and see testicles
You probably fantasize about vegetables
like cucumbers and bananas havin sex with you
And you probably let gerbels crawl up your rectum too
Shame on you; I (*defecate*) on you
and simultaneously (*urinate*) on you
and pour some acid rain on you
I stop your heartbeat with heat
You weak nigga, I'll leave your blood spillin in the street
Chorus
[C]	Ayyo Journalist what you workin with?
[J]	Old school burners with
barrels big enough for you head to fit in the circle shit
What you holdin Canibus?
[Canibus]
30 bulllet banana clips
Just to handle the kick I gotta glue it to my hands and shit
We got permits to murder shit
We critically injure niggaz who deserve the shit
Put em in a tournaquet
[Journalist]
Bomb proof Suburbans with tractor-tread tires
so we can ride through the dirt with it (drive over curbs with it)
Merc in it, even over slippery surfaces we can swerve in it
(And crash into niggaz who don't deserve they shit)
Try stoppin the dudes, you gotta be bruised
Cockin the tools that knock you out your socks and your shoes
[Canibus]
We'll leave you shoeless and keep shootin
Look how much life liquid you losin
You need a blood transfusion
[Journalist]
In the back of a medic truck, shots in your neck and gut
while we holdin our weapons up, I'm still reppin' Philly - what?
(Blood spillin in the streets!) The what?
(Blood spillin in the streets!)
(Blood spillin in the streets!) The what?
(Blood spillin in the streets!)
Chorus
.. The what? .. The what? ..

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
Was born in a small town (?), California
Where them gangstas bang ghetto life thuggin on the corner
Youngest child of six
When I came pops split with momma
Used to visit on the weekends
Till he moved to the north side of Cali
14 he died, 15 my moms died
Alcoholic diabetic forces were my life too
Moved with my older brother taught me discipline
But I wasn't ready though still shocked and holding pain in
So I skipped school got F's got the posters on my wall
takin down no TV times I felt like ya'll ain't want me around
Set up in my room developing the mind of a loner
Writin rhymes rappin out my days instead of homework
Through it all my three sisters placed the place like one time
As I was like this rap thing is gonna pay I know that I was triflin
But still set in my ways livin for better days
Until I die I'm startin if I'm broke or with that cheddar check
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
purest purest
purest purest
purest purest purest purest!
Love
The two realest cats I know? My two older brothers
The most beautiful woman in the galaxy? My mother
The strongest black women raising kids alone? My sisters
The best part of my future is my present love interest
The most important time? Right now and ever after
The greatest expression is love, happiness, and laughter
See life is a book and this song is just another chapter
I'll stay down to earth and real if you speak I'll speak back
I'm not a preacher or a scholar I'm merely just a rapper
I probably don't fit in to the current state of -
- what you consider that to be So you ask how can I rap
if I ain't thugged out, pimpin, flossin my ice, packin a gat
Man if this is what I got, I want dough I can't lie
But never sell my soul 'n front inside mainstream's eyes
The purest love is how I'm driven, sent, and reach for my goals
If nothing else I'll leave the world some songs that speak from the soul
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

Military perfection. Fragile tranquility
Artificial familiarity. Civility
What happened? Noisy neighbors died of suspense
Have a nice day and stay on your side of the fence
My crew was called the Right Angles. We made a remark
We played in the park and we're afraid of the dark
Declared destroyed and paranoid in the bathroom checkers
3-D movies and Pat Boone records
At noon that tune becomes my own truth
22 grown youth crammed inside a phone booth
Davy Crockett. Magic tricks. They call me "Crazy Pockets"
Butt kicked. A-bombs. Sputnik. Navy rockets
Napalm and mustard on hot dogs at the diner
Shoulder blades of older dates and waitresses on roller skates
Solar plates and gasoline. Vaseline. Oh, Fanny Mae
Hardware - the family trade. Planning a panty raid...
What'cha gonna do when the bad man comes back?
What'cha gonna do hu'h?
What'cha gonna do when the bad man comes back?
What'cha gonna do hu'h?
Beach blanket party. Clean faces, serene places
Silence between spaces and submarine races
Obscene cases of extreme racists. Stone jerk
Diminished and degraded when I'm finished doing the homework
White bread. Nose bleed. Chose speed. Don't need to
Grow weed. Law abiding citizen. Exposed greed
Two-shoes. Optimistic, hoping for better weather
Pretty girl with a pony tail I'll let her wear my letter sweater
Working up a sweat. Bench press. Chin up curls
Action-adventure in my bedroom with the pin up girls
Perry Como. Johnny Mathis. Astronomy classes. Crap
You've been slapped wearing a coon skin cap
Fingers and demonic jaws. Peace treaties. Atomic laws
Cosmic flaws. Conspiracy theories and the Masonic lodge
Milkshake - spilled mine. Guilt finer than silk twine
Baby-doll: built fine. Lighting up the tilt sign...
What'cha gonna do when the bad man comes back?
What'cha gonna do hu'h?
What'cha gonna do when the bad man comes back?
What'cha gonna do hu'h?

"Live Your Life" take T.I.-M-E
"Day and Night" just like Kid Cudi
You'll think of me, you will oh
Drake would say that you're "The Best He Ever Had"
Rumors come and go but you keep your shadow
Everywhere you go, it follows
Can't understand I still love you
(Watch the thugs talk about this one)
Cause I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like, damn you let me down, down, down
You're famous girl for breaking hearts
You're famous girl, girl, girl
You're famous girl, girl, girl
You're famous girl, girl, girl
Shoulda known you'd break my heart, heart, heart
Keri would've said my love knocks her down
Keisha would've told me I was sent from heaven
Sorry B, I don't wear no "Halo"
You were first to play the game, though
Sorry I bust the windows out your car
I might of cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia"
But I meant it in "Forever",
We were supposed to be together
And I can't let you go
Said you thought you find the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like, damn I let you down, down, down
Yes I'm famous girl for breaking hearts
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart

I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart
(that I would break your heart)
Many hearts we shoulda left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure, I wished I was frozen
See, we lost our way now
I hope you're happy being famous, girl
You're famous girl, girl, girl
(Shoulda known that you would break my heart)
You're famous girl, girl, girl
(Shoulda known that you would leave me lonely)
You're famous girl, girl, girl (yeah)
Shoulda known you'd break my heart, heart, heart
(That you would break my heart)
(But then again)
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
(I've broken my share of hearts)
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm famous girl, girl, girl
(Shoulda known from the start that we would break apart)
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart
(Yeah)

And I freak like that
Cause my be	-bong is fat
[Digital Underground]
You need a digital lover
You need a digable brother
Yeah, you need a nigga to love ya

Buy my posthumous full-length
My colorfully packaged disembodied shriek
Converted to ring tones used in car ads
Sung by winged gnomes over the head of Dick Clark
Cover pages graced by the chiseled hard abs
Of this now charred slab of dead pop diva
Recreated as the head of Biz Mark
Spliced on top of Hello Kitty
On a virtual land mass with a hip-kink
It's lip-synched to my song and committed to telecine
And the nothing left of me is left to bask in a camera flash
I've never been so successful 'till I died
And my label wished my heavenly chariot
Pre-board defunct
I didn't die in a hail of gunfire
I died doing extreme sports at a resort
On a bungee cord on a ski jump
No need to ask how a dead rapper can be a label's cash cow
They just record me months before on G-funk string chords
Add an R&B; chorus
Hit a keyboard key to punch
Even though I'm dead
I was booked on a fortnight
To exhaust notes dressed like a cockroach
Now I'm cooked and ate with a fork and knife
As your reheated pop sensation
I'm framed under a caption reading "prog-rap"
And given open-handed god smacks
By partisan zealots who not only think I draft-dodged Iraq
But that my back catalog is wack
And for it I should be flogged and smacked
But little do they know I'm dead already
And their complaints are small and petty
My autopsy was broadcast and shot on a webcam
I'm a dead man with golden blood in my bedpan

Check this out, bust it
This is like a rocket, you never packed
This many condominiums in your pocket
Uh, you never smoked this much weed before
Where else can these niggas go
Don't know tomorrow, it's about today, bruh
I want some coochie that I ain't gotta pay for
I'm the one that holidayed ya
ATL, land where we par-laya
No nigga jealous with his gat wanna clown
It's enough females in the streets to go round two, three times
Atlanta, the doctor's home
Always somebody hoggin the payphone
Say homes, where your daughter
She'll tell ya I'm pure like Artesian water
Feed me a quarter like a jukebox
I sell rhymes like rocks, the police oughta stop checkin
The Lord gave me a blessing
Long as rocks I sees with you
Think the Lord pleased with you
Uh, you think he kissed you
You think he kissed you
Or he dissed you
Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
Yeah, Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
Bust it
Suits of brutality patrol sectors
Day care centers ran by vestors
Drunk drivers behind the steering wheel of liquor trucks
New comers think they won the diversion on pure luck
Shark pools in the hall, one drop can start a frenzy
Feeding off of your ignorance of the law consider no excuse
We here by being careful, vigilence
Vampires lace personal pants with blood
Just ask for the special
Crackers crave samples of niggas urine
Strands of hair and semen
Blue lights in the basements
Having conversations with voices between four by fours
Rack 'em up, I'll bust your head
Stay playing the role of executioner, been years on death row
Now he don't wanna die for arranging his wife's murder
Equal opportunity, designated bullets don't discriminate
Like unemployment, officers doing break
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
One deep in this team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
(Poetry runs deep in this team)
Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
Yeah, Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
Bust it
Belligerent thoughts of militant ways
Camouflaged in the brush, love or lust
Which can we trust hidden in the cuts
Terr-i-ble they bounce 'em every third month
Yeah, after the big flood of truth
Caught in your own evidence
Now you hesitant to believe me
You back to hangin with Parks
That's what you called her
Now you run cause you know that's what you want
If I felt like everything was good
Maybe then I could knock on wood
To protect the good
That surrounds my innermost thoughts
Until my thoughts were caught unguarded
As hard as it is to be perfect I try
And I still flaw listening to the next guy
That knew more and saw it before I did
Came up big, to dig an early grave
Get locked up, and turn a slave for the rhythm
We rap, still get slapped by the system
Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
Yeah, ooetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green

This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
Hidin' under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
Connivin' Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin', "Let's get it on"
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin' your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music
You know why my hands are so numb? No
'Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't come, oh
Smacked this whore for talkin' crap, bitch
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin' hate you, I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you, hell yeah
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin' a hot dog readin' the Holy Quran while I'm on the John
Tired of wearin' this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs, thong, thong, thong
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms, fuck your love songs
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump, click-clack
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin' out this fuckin' club in your drawers
We lovin' the broads, there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source, it's fight music
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin', "You hear that?"
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin', came back and fucked up
His pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin, it's fight music
These beads I'm swingin' is stingin' 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin' 'em
If any nigga lookin' too hard, we Rodney King 'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin' 'em with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin', right when your wife's lookin'
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin' your life music
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's and you Nazis
Watch me 'cause you thinkin' you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise 'em 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and it's called
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid, it's fight music

What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
"I remember it clearly, even today"
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent
Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds
(They shall not escape my vengeance)
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)
And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey

360 seconds it's on, unlimited firsts from calibers unknown
Come wit it in ya verse or take a job and stay gone
I don't care if it's rehearsed or off the top of your dome
With this specified time you can do as you please
Make a decision to create life or spread death and disease
We got 360 degrees of emcees
That make these rap niggaz sound like they swangin' from trees
Everythang from brain food to puttin' broads on they knees
We do it all for the love and never all for the cheese
Hot tub, bubbling like warm water call me, hot tub
Cut your wife and daughter like a meat cleaver, we be the Dungeon Family
Niggaz up under the step from A T L to over stand me
D F, is the clique I represent, puffin' purple
Poppin' poppers, spittin' straight pimp shit
Conversation without compensation, we sensed it
It's not to mention yo' girl, your persistant in
Nothin' physical happened but give me 6 minutes
When ya off, somebody gonna fit in it
Say no names, wear my hair longer than your first strang
Yo' girl wish she was drafted for the Georgia drill team
But I ain't gon' say no more
You need to catch somebody else I'm 'bout to hit the door, I'ma
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
Fine lil' mama, my home gon' be a palace
Laid out like a salad, keep a nigga from malace
I'm movin' things to the south
A dog like me need a pussycat 'round the house, with a row bone
Ain't nothin' like me, you baby with no clothes on
I'm tired of runnin' the streets all night
And a girlfriend ain't gon' stay down witcha like a wife
I can't let all you girls get to my head
'Cuz you know what I want between them legs
Hey I'm just walkin' outta foot locker strollin' through green briar
Stepped in the food court just gonna but a bean pot
Ay cool cool cutta, cut her to the finch
If a girl gotta future behind her, I'm up in it
And I like a pretty lady with a tailback mouth
'Cuz if you hit the right spot, she'll go back runnin' her mouth
Now every time I meet a girl she puttin' her hand in her purse
And when my next record drop I ain't wearin' no shirt let's do it
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
Hats off, nigga can we put a fist in 'fore we handle business?
Hallelujah, for the bank
Benzes, houses, hummers, tanks and all that
Gon' see, that they meet shack in the end
The world was my enemy, that's who was my friends
On the strong delucious, unstoppable, followin' the tradition of men
Can't say aww look at that man
He's too dirty for industry dead ass, or is he!
Five minutes and fiftynine seconds gone by
Are you really ready for this lyrical high?
We can shoot without bullets, D F to the fullest
Should it, ever come to light it's true art, not hype
Comin' strong, take the mic, make sure it's tight
I rock a party all night
With my team on the right, straight ready for the
Lights, camera, action, Ms. Jackson
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
Introdu, introdu, introducing ice cold water
We stay sharp as a broke glass bottle
Just as sure as four quarters make a dollar
Ten dimes do too and I ain't take none shorter
Pay attention to every quote we say
'Cuz I got this here like it's in stores today
Holla ready to rock, when he step on the scene
'Cuz shorty stay clean like, shicka-ding shicka-ding
Well I can be that and you need that, freaky D that
And if you want your monologue and open come and seek me
A few done fried man or we can bligh man
I'm the guy that kill ya cat and, I dare you to defy me
If you can time me, I promise in sixty seconds
You'll be intriged and overwhelmed and obligated to rewind me
That reminds me and my name is the Divinely
Human see and I hope you had a freaky time fuckin' with me
6 minutes, 6 minutes

you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we
keep it true
you know we keep it true - we got to keep it true we got to keep
it true
we got to keep it true - you know what we do you know what
we do
we got to keep it true
relax your mind w/the music - you know what we do you know what we do
sit back and vibe w/this true shit
this isn't really what you think it is
that is if you're even thinkin' in the first place
the first place isn't always the winner
and winnin' isn't everything
and this is not a race
i am not a android i am not a mongoloid
i am not annoyed by the void in your brain
this is not a trick son you are not a victim
you are just a man be	-boyed out the game
let me explain
Abstract are you fresh?
ain't nobody fresher
but it's hard to get around w/out some clown tryin' to test ya
Acey are you dope?
dopest in the world
i give it to the moms and pops i give it to the boys and girls
oh so you a family man?
aren't we all aren't we all
yes we are
trying to make jams man and expand my repertoire
we got to keep it true we got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
you know what we do you know what we do - sit back and vibe w/this true shit
well i be arrangin' thoughts in my brain cell family
embarking on incredible creative routes
understanding me is truth shining like a lie
when i say break wide i mean take trips not just in your ride
in your mind
cause when you left you're right on time
the sun'll come out tomorrow and it'll set in the west
so i don't sweat the rest
who want to inhale stress
keep it true
you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we
keep it true
you know we keep it true - you know what we do you know what we
do
we got to keep it true - the W the W the W
we got to keep it true
relax your mind w/the music - and keep it true and keep it true
sit back and vibe w/this true shit
the world is full of bullshitters
liars and triers and quitters
could-a-beens want to be's thought-i-was isn't-i-is's
and everybody in your business
damn
now what is really your main aim
when you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane
just another name in the phone book of fame
bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough
to be seen in the right scene
your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm
but your actions don't follow through
remember
never say never because it never comes true
your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance
you told me that you're a level higher
liar
element of desire earth and the wind and the fire
not
you ain't even halfway hot
not lukewarm you don't got no form
you (...?...)
all caught up in bein' waterproof
when you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth
for all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in
gold
that's probably why you get blowed
cause people tell people things and people sell people things
that are useless and irrelevant
and it stifles my intelligence
i stay true
you know we keep it true - and we keep on and keep on and keep on
you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true
you can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say
but i doubt it's gonna affect me i row my boat steady
everready is my battery description
meaning i'm equipped to take long trips
and my brain cells overload when i get blowed
gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops
being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (?singers?)
the smoke from my last hit still lingers
bring us your tired and your weary and your poor
i'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors
and similes
assimilation of new creation
mind emancipation
rhymes command the nation
and so on and therefor and such and such
dust to dust i thrust from the ground
w/no where else to go but up L.A. is where i'm found
throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up Stepney
about to get a heavy track
(?or jimmy in the spot?)
or plenty of hip hop goin' round three
heavyweights it's your time so register
foundate your legacy we serve all them replicas
true style true style?
true style new style
you know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we keep it true
you know we keep it true - the W and every crew we keep it true
we got to keep it true - from me to you do what you do just keep it
true
we got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
now i'm gonna take my last verse on a good note
you better prepare your footnotes
hold your wigs tight
open up the middle
(?center me in the more?)
words are the foundation action is the building and unity
and the concept to result in logic and the use of logic
now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement
and the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz
what hip hop is
you know we keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
we got to keep it true - sit back and vibe to this true shit
the wrong thing to do is stop

Okay
[Chorus]
You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth
Yeah, you got to know what your love is worth
As soon as a child is born and discovers earth
It's a part of life, so don't get fucked in the end
If someone's a lost cause, they'll be summoned up to start again
Example, you a woman, in a relationship
It seems like everything you do makes him flip
It ain't physical violence, or nothing like that
But the love that you show he doesn't show back
But it started when you first met
You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet
(yeah, I bet)
He wanted to be down like Brandy
At first his overbearing persona was so manly (oh)
But now you're thinkin' most of the time, "he can't stand me"
He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha)
But then you find out he feel good about Candy
You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding
Everyone makes mistakes and that's true
But from the beginning did he really love you?
To him you a bitch, he told his boys he dug you out
And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you
You wonder how you get attracted to these
With a mackin' disease, with a tactic to please
But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze
Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya
You got to know what your love is worth
That way you don't waste it on the world goin berserk
Yeah
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy
You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?)
Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try
Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store
Even though you the one she couldn't stand before
Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion
You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin'
Cause you visualize the romance, she like "no hands on"
She don't want to fuck with no man, "not even a slow dance?"
You tried to kiss her and she even agrees
But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great
Let it be her mistake, yeah
Don't waste your time bro cause you know
If she don't appreciate what he do for her
Then tell me why he should wait around

[Dead men tell no tales.
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale
Mr. big sleep with the carp and kelp]
Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigator starboard to port
By the nautical star of male an the harbor is yours
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy j-j-j-Jones.
Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs.
Come all the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish.
"What the heck!" grabbed for his telescope
Shatter gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel the 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey.
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar,
He'll be the laughing stock of the barbary coast war
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side
Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he'd feud and he'd brawl
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And battle always find him though he never told cutthroats
Meanwhile, back in the now, Got a brand new skeleton crew
On the move out When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth
Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed.
And he was aching from his boots to the feather in his cap
Till his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock,
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave,
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid.
Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much.
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
An area high tide so grand it's the one that put the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land
I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water.
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to slow those sails
Remember that dead men tell no t-t-t-tales

Slick Rick chains ill nigga
Get brains with the fucking Hilfiger nah
Shit changed I gotta rock something flier
McGiver get outta shit smooth like that, get higher
In these kicks, prince sneakers, jogs is loose,
Robbing truce, while my revolver shoots
Chinky eyed, devils is grin
Purple range rovers, waking up with hangovers
God damn I need my brain sober
So I jump up in the ride and slide
Me and my nigga Jon Clue, just called he got the purple 5
Damn nigga's is live, Queensed out
Got to put the card hard jeans on
I faked out, til this light green caliweed
Henessey dro, use to only cop thug sacks but now I cop a oh
Six double oh, I trick a couple hoe's
Get em in my car, dirty shit all in the fucking floor
Clean that shit up now throw in outside
Took about four hundred G's to cop the bulletproof ride
Bentley its on, yo we on the world tall
We got a show on, top of the coliseum open doors
Let them rock-a-way nigga's in
Queens bridge starting shit, chill, calm it down we got to blend it in
School of hard knocks shirts, chopping hurts
From the Hurst, yo corona play the sideline, yea it works
Yo when we put it all in the same fam, yo round up the queen's click
Check out the game plan
[Chorus: x2]
Queens's nigga's rock ice and smoke hydro
Keep heat for the beef and don't hide yo
Young nigga's get cash and cop rides yo
Queens bitches, stepping up with thick thighs yo
Cause every in brown skin
Queensed out from public housin
Comes the one known as the garson child, rappers is bowing
Look at em, they roll me red carpets
Praising me as one of the dead profits
When I talk these nigga's heads bobbin
Strait out of queens with TNT, they did there first drug stain
With one and hundred cop shots, niggas with first scene
With D-Days and cop killing, laws was made
10 G's to a witness, you seen a cop get sprayed
What's on the AGQ club or club Mercedes
Sunrise, movie theaters to chill with our ladies
Load up the 80's cause cop killing craz is crazy
40 to basely, Q gardens to woodhaven
To AQ that got booted barrel goddy that was made in
Whips on the vanwick queens day and shy stadium
Anything that's transported to New York
Got a come through the gates of either 2 airports
Kennedy and Luigudia we come through bod of you
Bloodhounds follow you; wolves ill get on top of you
Push prints Camaro's paper here to Somalia
Blaze off double barrels, shall follow you
[Chorus: x2]

Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
It's never old school, all brand new
So everybody catch, the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever, not like a cold
The beats are clear, the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music, first things first
First of all, get off the wall
It's time to party so have a ball
We slowed it on down, so get the hell up
Like a volcano I'll erupt
We got determination, bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet
So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
I do not sing but I make a Def song
You could live your whole life and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
We're the Beastie Boys, not Cheech and Chong
Strong as an ox, fresh out the box
The crowd is so live, they're coming in flocks
And when we go on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock there's nothing soft
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock
We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top
M.C.A., Adrock, Mike D. makes three
And we can do it like this in the place to be
When I'm recorded, you'll be rewarded
I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded
Not P.C.P. or L.S.D. just me Mike D. in the place to be
This is not free, you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.
So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
The beat is slow in order to dance
I want to hear I dos and no I can'ts
First you move your leg and then your arm
It's not fast and nervous, this dance is calm
It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable
So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

This Jet Life, don't scrub, you blot that
Flow runs in the Porsche, I'm out front and got my top back
Label me a author, fore founder of lifestyle rap
Watching these niggas borrow game, not acknowledging where they got that
Though I fall back, let them run with that, consider those my rebel kids
Clashing with they father figure when they know they wanna be just like him
Where might I have been without my pen to scribble about what I done wit 'em
Girls that I took home last night, Chevys I sat on top them rims
I'm good in front of that camera lens, weed smoke when my video spins
At her house, rolling up in her boy shorts, my mafia bitch
Plotting up, I'm counting up, going for it cause I go and get it
So you liable to see her with me, my pockets fat, my tie skinny
Loud pack, got a louder engine, 80 large, all Benjamins
Vacationing, 2 nights spending, I ain't tripping
Fool I know how to get that back, homie my triple O showed me that
Same thing showed my how to roll them Zags
And my reputation precedes me, they already know
I keep it capital G apostrophe D
Going hard, making it look easy
'Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV
And my reputation precedes me, they already know

Going hard, making it look easy
'Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV
You know I do it like I'm doing it for do
Watch the shoes, ostrich, you know what time it is like 2 watches
My reputation, detonation on destination
I separated, elevated, get salutation
I'm seldom seen in forest green foreign machine
Dirty south but the engine clean and that pussy clean
Criminal thing, a criminal mind
I got a pocket full of dead presidents, I'ma bring them alive
Riding shotgun with that K on the side
Bitches that I'm done with, let them lay on the side
Clock on your mind, I'm ahead of your time
Hublot transform like Optimus Prime
Diamonds on, diamonds off, shawty ass kinda soft
Tattoos, lip gloss, pockets on Rick Ross
I'm fantasizing a tantalizing experience
Bitches like photography, I just take a pic
And my reputation precedes me, they already know
I keep it capital G apostrophe D
Going hard, making it look easy
'Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV
And my reputation precedes me, they already know

Going hard, making it look easy
'Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV
I'm up in this, 442 on them Budnik rims
I'm what a pimp, all them gangsta bitches fuck with him
Bring ducketts in
When records wasn't really bumping, they was in love with him
To see him balling is like drugs to them
Mama calling for that Jet to put a reservation in
Ain't concerned where she going 'long as she stay with him
They be seeking that foundation, stable niggas with paper
I'm all that, but I'm stingy, you ain't write n'an one of these raps
And love, I'm so serious, you might get high from Henny
Get stupid fly at any event, spray some Ozium in that vent
Bring them hoes and tell them shake that shit, send my jail niggas flicks
We live it, she love it, in the kitchen, in the oven mitt
It's Jet Life over e'ry bitch
And e'ry bitch ass nigga breaking they back, tryna take care of them
We get high, we laugh at them
I swear ain't no comparin' them to no nigga in my area
This Jet Life, no play time, we cut them hoes, you carry them
And my reputation precedes me, they already know
I keep it capital G apostrophe D
Going hard, making it look easy
'Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV

[Verse 1]
She was more than a woman a goddess for all it seems,
And all I ever needed was her right here lovin' me,
For a while we were cool and the groovin' love was on,
But I still remember, how it felt when our love was gone.
[Chorus 1]
In a tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took, years ago,
Secret memories in her mind,
How could love be so unkind, heartbreak time.
[Chorus 2]
Faded pictures in a broken glass,
Like a mirror revealing, what the women is feeling.
Was it someone from a distant past,
Cause its breaking my heart to watch her stare into the glass.
[Verse 2]
As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face,
I could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way.
Then she stopped then she came to a page where her diary ends,
To smell the scent of old rose, from her lover I suppose.
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

On and on, Bubba K no matter what I say
These country folks wouldn't have it, no other way
Cause I yell, but they ain't got nothin' else to say
And I got a heat warm and tugged away
Plus the beep, beep, Timmy keep heat
Him and Rick each, ain't no weak links
Guess I'm just different than whatever you sniffin'
Still the same language, this ain't hieroglyphics
Ask am I prolific? Yes sir indeed
Really who are you to be questionin' me
See how I maneuver so effortlessly
You'll be hard pressed to find a fresher MC
[Chorus: x2]
Free willy, take a load off
Please silly, I ain't takin' no loss
He's really got the greatest tone dog
One potata, two potata, three potata don't pause
Betty boo, let it loose, work it for that revenue
Am I not the most uniquest person that you ever knew?
Walk up in the party, sanitation blurtin' with a brew
Bet ya this album does all the first one didn't do
Stop with the badgerin', can't you see I'm staggerin'?
All that you babblin', ain't even close to matterin'
What you shouldn't think, you should know that I'm arrogant
My "come to talk Bubba" shirt, tonight I ain't wearin' it
[Chorus: x2]

Hickory dickory dock, dock
Hickory dickory dock, dock
Your girl pulled out my cock, my cock
Here a girl, there a girl, ev'rywhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock, dock, your girl pulled out my cock, my cock
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Patrone, double shots, wit no chase
Sticky green, fire it up and blow it in yo' face
We deep, 50 deep, so don't hate
Forever never slippin' naw, pimpin' we straight
What it do, the bets back, the checks fat, the track tight
We funna cook a fresh batch
Money maker, you makin' money, then show me some
Dime pieces, bend it over let me see ya thong
Shades on, blacka bodies, I'm in my zone
Trunk kickin' like it know karate
We sittin' tall, big ball, and MJ pushin' to the limit
I'm reppin' for Tennesy so I gotta keep it pimpin' now
Here a girl, there a girl, ev'rywhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock, dock, your girl pulled out my cock, my cock
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
They call me [pimp tight] MJG you know I party hard
Most a y'all pussy cat niggas and they go holly ward
Any time you wanna load up, you know I'm ready
Rich ass niggas can't ride in my Chevy
You don't wanna hear me speak, you just wanna see my rims
Spinnin' underneath my vehicle like a like a roll of film
I don't even need tint, they already know it's me
If I add tint, when I get out they'll know it's me
Hennessey, gray goose, good purp, and patrone
Gotta keep a lot of it, so I can stay in the zone
Every time I'm in the hood, every time I'm in the club
Look kids, grown folks, old folks show me love
Here a girl, there a girl, ev'rywhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock, dock, your girl pulled out my cock, my cock
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Wheels spinnin', the kush burning
The beat knockin', I know the pill kickin' in go on get it poppin'
Don't be scared, we rock stars, we party hard
Valley park 20 cars then go and buy the bar
Bleed, we keep it gritty, we keep it gutta
Bangas worldwide I'm ya neighborhood cooch cutta
Yeah, spray it on some cooch butta, some call it K Y
Say my mutha fuckin' name girl, say my name
Pimp tight, MJG, millions we runnin' through pimp daily
You can crawl at the bottom, 'til ya make ya knees hurt
Or do it like I do it, make the block bleed work
Here a girl, there a girl, ev'rywhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock, dock, your girl pulled out my cock, my cock
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Here a girl, there a girl, ev'rywhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock, dock, your girl pulled out my cock, my cock
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week

A nigga gotta take a girl with the back
I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm back
I wish you understood why I'm back
It would take a lotta pressure off my back
Uh, uh, uh
Most of these hard rocks turn out to be soft as wet dog shit
Talkin shit, but when the fog spits, dog they all split
Then all hit the ground around the same time
In the same frame of mind, ?thangs up in the nine?
Left them bitches blind, hit 'em up from behind

And he had such a good head up on his shoulders, but I blew that
Fuck you black, you new cats don't know somethin important
You die quick fuckin with my shit, and my shits extortin

It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cause he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cause thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cause they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
'Cause you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be crossed flippin, but on some east coast terms
New York niggas do, fuck the perms
A nigga gotta take a girl with the back
I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm back
I wish you understood why I'm back
It would take a lotta pressure off my back
A nigga gotta take a girl with the back
I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm back
I wish you understood why I'm back
It would take a lotta pressure off my back

It's the resurgence of the happy black rappers
But now African medallions are handicap placards
And we're alphabetized in the modernized retro
And my press photos are wallet-size
My rent's low
Why don't you shape me
I'm malleable fleshy putty
In a salad bowl with dill dressing
In simulated urban field testing
Dressing thuggy
Accompanied by a sexy bunny
Straight out of a burlesque show
She'll sever the ring finger of the lead singer
And stir a fresh bowl
Of the bitch's brew with bee stingers
But Leimert's fresh though
It's home of the black speed-reader
Perplexed our blurbs stretch
To suggest that I'm spacy
But the bird nest is low
Which means I'm commonplace
To the point we travel the country in wooden spaceships
On the phone cursing at the booking agents
I wield words and I pilfer the country with the underground's who's who
But I feel like I've been sodomized with a billiard's pool cue
I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon
From my air balloon
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
Then put them sound asleep in a fireplace
It's the return of the unpopular dope rappers
Who retreat to holes in the sky
Climbing up rope ladders
And will sell you a silver disc soaked in laughter
Because you've been brainwashed
Out of your ears leaks soap lather
Why don't you deify me
I'm Buckaroo Bonsai
I don't know what to do
I'm the wrong guy
I touch crews like Krush Groove on DVD
And I got my start doing songs with CVE
But now you're like:
Chilling Villain who? Project what?
Persona non grata
No wristband for the popsicle stick man
He's a wad of hot lava
Drip crayon on your clipped glands
Won't squander top dollar
Twists strands to enrich fans
But there's not a lot of offers
They give grands to kitsch bands
I water lawns
For the ADD D&D; role players
And we got along
So we formed a commonwealth
And you hear me through random sightings and file sharing
And you tell me that songwriting's like childbearing
No it's not
It's self-indulgence
Elfin culprits watch their egos melt in charcoal pits
Oh my
Sorry I left my acceptance speech
In the back of the private car
And I rewrote the Hollywood ending
Fluxed the motion picture screen
Made it so the black guy doesn't die by the opening scene

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
You can see it in my eyes
Always bout my G's
You can see it in my eyes
Always bout my G's
You can see it in my eyes
Always bout my G's
You can see it in my eyes
You can see it in my eyes
Money on the rise (always bout my G's)
Money on the rise (always bout my G's)
Money on the rise (always bout my G's)
You can see it my eyes
[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
They say I'm doing my thing boy is you awake or what
Ernest got the 450 looking like you can taste the truck
Forget working for people getting my power and paper up
Americas top model watch is that a pretty face or what
I make a vehicle and sell it like its e-bay
You know I get my money back like its a re-bay
I drop a mixtape and they party like its they b-day
They diss jockin so I'ma call 'em dj's
Know 4 killas then trust that I know 4reala
Stay on ya turf and in dirt like a 4 wheela
4reala now everybody's a gold digga
Beer face 4 the paper I get so BITTER!
Like fat pat when I rap they say "love it man"
Prince Hakeem paper shout out to the motherland
Fat stacks that you can't fit inside a rubberband
Big straps one I can't fit inside my other hand
Club for free like the bartenders
Boys talkin noise like you really gonna try to holla maaan
I gotta army that be on to you before you can
You tryin to stand behind a bush like a republican
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
You on the top they gonna hate ya (hate ya)
You on the bottom they goin break ya (break ya)
Thats why I'm always bout my paper
And it ain't no surprise that my money's on the rise
I know why you act like a faka (faka)
I know that hatin's in ya nature (nature)
Thats why I'm always bout my paper
And it ain't no surprise that my money's on the rise
At paid-n-full even swisha
He told me that I'm walkin with ya
Even told me that when I feel lonely I ain't the only 1 in the picture
Haters don't shoot to miss ya so wear the shoe if it fits ya
They load up the tool to get ya they throw it at you like plika, plika, plika
I know people don't understand me
They have some problems with homies then have some problems with family
But I don't ever fold it don't matter what car they hand me
Just when I thought evil had me I looked up and won a grammy
Maannn!
[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Scooby-Doo, y'all
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, y'all
I remember the time them niggas tried to get me (I ain't havin' it)
Throw your hands in the air, the Hill's live and direct, see
So let me put my clip in, watch this nigga start flippin'
My, why must they always be trippin'?
Shut up, what up, fool tried to nut up
Dropped the gat, riccocheted, the fool got cut up
(Why'd you drop the gat, G?) I got hit from behind
Now a nigga like me, I gotta go for mine
Bring it on, bing, make ya bells ring
When ya hit that pavement, what a feeling
It's on, cracked like a baseball bat
Oh shiiiiiiiit, out the boot came a gat
Pointed (aimed) the nigga said "You're through!"
Scooby Doo! 'Cause I had a boy too!
[Chorus]
I remember the time them niggas tried to get me (I ain't havin' it)
Throw your gats in the air if you want to come test me
So let me just run through, as I pull out my Scooby-Doo
I get the chills when I see that dead man's crew
I got to get up, let's go head up, dead up
I'm loc'ed like that, punk, that's why you're gettin' wet-up
Want me to let up, but I ain't tryin' to hear that
Bullshit cryin', punk, let me just clear that
Buck a shot, lick a two shot, lick a three shot
Ran out of ammo, damn, I ain't tryin' to get got
Two niggas standin', dirty under-handed
Lighter shade of fire, check my slug expanded
Now tell me what the fuck are you gonna do
When I pull out my Scooby-Doo?
[Chorus]
Take a good look 'cause this is the last time you're gonna see fat bell like this again, you fat piece a chit! Kid muchacho, muchacho kid, get flabby - (oh - choot that piece a chit.) You
fuckin' lobsta piece a CHIT! I'll stomp you like a duck. And you ...you with your little happy chain of lighters ...you want to fuck with me, you fuck with the best! And you ...you with the burly haircut, the Stawberry Quik guy ...you around the way, main. I know where you at.

[CHORUS]
In my Continental
Splinter off the mental
When you want the best show
Never accept anything less
Elements of purpose
True love from the first kiss
Spread it on the surface
Sit back and watch the progress
[VERSE 1: Slug]
T-t-t-t-t-t-teacher, teacher, how can I learn patience?
Planted in the middle and outside of your nation
Take the care to build a familiar foundation
Speak to the youth that keep the truth sacred
Free the, free the good inside your heart
Your neighborhood, it needs you to travel with your art
From New York to Cali, some day they'll all know
Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Chicago
Now I've come a long way from the younger days
When I used to look up curse words in my dictionary
If life's a game, gotta choose a side to play
If I gotta pick a position I'ma pick missionary
I've had a little bit too much to think tonight
But it's cool, I be alright, just make sure that I keep travellin
Your reactions only reinforce the previous thoughts
You'd feel the distance even if the bridge was collapsin
Well, kudos and props and every hollow desire
That you could conjure in an instant that it takes to breathe
I got my Duplos and blocks and Lincoln Logs for when it's time to build
I wait patiently for them to catch up to speed
(And I'll be)
[CHORUS]
[VERSE 2: Slug]
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-teacher, teacher, show me what you know now
Load up your van with musicians and go south
Visit Atlanta, Memphis, Tulsa, Texas
Plug in the decks, check the mics, fight the wreckage
Keep the, keep the motive in your movement
Let em know where you come from and show them how you do it
Children are the focus, give em one to grow with
Learn em how to take they minutes, turn em into moments
See, nowadays cats think they on some next
And they sacrifice they voice just to go over heads
If I felt as if I had somethin special to tell
Why would I work against myself and hide it under my belt?
I used to try to lace the phrases with magic tricks
Every paragraph needed translation attached to it
They saw the style, respected the craft
But all I did was confuse em, would try to get em to laugh
Painted pictures in the primer, no one got the pulp
Found the humor, the anger and the insult
Why should I waste any oxygen
Tryin to find the in-between-the-lines that they get lost within?
I'm out there for the craft, for the cause
The laughter, the applause, the passion for the flaws
The fact that I'ma draw some heads to what I'm feelin
Lift em all up until they try to touch the ceiling
Come on and reach the, reach the masses won by singular
They hold you and they smile when they feel what you can bring to the
Culture and sow it, cultivate the flow with
Breath control and he kept it whole, be-
Cause piece by piece the picture turns to puzzle
If you lose a few those that remain change into rubble
Freedom is a word not heard from those that own it
Can't fix the machine if you don't have the components
(And I'll be)
[CHORUS]
Cause we're not from this planet
We come from somewhere else
And you can't understand it
Cause you don't know yourself
But when the time is right
Our path will be unveiled
Till then you seek your light
While I sit and bite my nails

Yeah, we in dis ho.
Me and my niggas,

Make room (make some room),

Bitch, bitch. We in dis ho.
(roll that shit up nigga)
Yeah,

Chillin on St. Clair where you can find me,
Escalade, pistol beside me,
If you don't know me don't say hi cause imma be thinkin that you try to rob me,
Round my hood these niggas in grimy,
Off in the cut, where you can find me,
Makin the room cloudy,
Makin the puff puff pass we rolled the personal blunts,
Getting that bread, often the case on the first of the month,
I travel the map, lettin these ho's know how these Cleveland niggas get down,
From ho ass niggas back at the crib,
Tried to play me, look at me now,
I got your bitch, never pick up the phone unless I'm in town,
She stalkin me, doin her research tryin to find out when I'm comin around,
These ho's just wanna be seen,

Louie Vuitton this and that,
Deus hangin off my ass
Yeah, we in dis ho,

Slabby and T
I let my pants sag to let the whole world know,
I'm is a nigga,
And if you disrespect me then,
Imma fuck this bitch up,
I'm fresher than a mother fucker workin everyday tryin to get my shit right,
Tryin to maintain in this cold world is like heel toein on thin ice,
Lightin up non stop THC,
Focus on more dollas
So much stress in my life there's a whole nother world of problems,
Been a young G my whole life so many of these niggas can't stop me,
Like these niggas is bitch made,
I'm what you can't copy,
I'm so cold these ho's know,
In the club, blowin smoke,
Gettin shows, not choosin,
Niggas in here straight losin,

(West, west, west, west, siiiide, nigga)
Verse #1
I rep that west, but a lot of yall niggas comin' wack
They want me to bring it back and I accept that test
So I'm sorta like a savior, with hits I'm gon ??
And I'm never slackin' off 'cause I gets it in major
My flavor is so undeniable (yeah)
That I'm bound to kill these MCs in threes, I'm liable
To get to cappin', you think it's only rappin'
But I'm known for pistol packin', it really gets a crackin'
What's happenin',
Whatch yall really want to do
Yall talk a good thang but we really comin' through
Big thangs when we aim
Leaving things slain
Blood guts and brains, for thinking it's a game
Insane or suicidal, I have yet to figure (yeah)
To make you pop off we disrespect you nigga
Like "fuck you fuck yourself" sound from the TEC
Run at E then hit the deck 'cause everythang gettin' wet
Okay corral, we can shoot it out
In L.A. we hold court in the street, fuck a trow
When I keep the bird on me, to pack it is a habit (why?)
'Cause I would rather die than not have it (yeah!)
Chorus
?? shots, guillotines, rifle scopes, red beams
L.A.'s very crazy, 'cause daily it's a murder scene
Gun shells ??, body parts, yellow tapes, dirty birds
High speed chases runnin' from the chase
Verse #2
You niggas pack guns for show and tell, we ??
Ask me why gangbangin's in my DNA
Burn you then sell a pistol
Never throw the heat away
Actin' like you ready to die, shit you can leave today
Hey Zeus ??
Now you two are treein', let your family mourn you
I'm from that place where they live at the hardest
All of those that couldn't cope they were dearly departed
Talkin' shit you must be clearly retarded
Don't ask about Osama, he was clearly a martyr
You thinkin' ?? must be dippin' that water
If you ever fuck with me I'll fuck around and put a clip in your daughter, yeah
Leave the body for the corner to chock it out
Too late to talk it out so fuck what you talkin' 'bout
Got murder on my mind (yeah), ya life is on the line (yeah)
Once my hand clench that iron then somebody die
You thinkin' death as a way to escape
But I will walk in your wake and put two in your face
Dirty cop wanna take me in, he's viewin' the case
Put him in the casket with you, bury you in the ??, nigga

This for boss bitches
For money making bitches
All my ladies throw your hands in the air
I got Patron in my cup
And I don't give a fuck
Baddest bitch in the club right here

Wanna pop it, pop it, pop it

Pull up on another set, phone call bout sex

(hook)x2
And it was written;
Up in the book of life.
That man shall;
Endure forever more.
well did you know the pen,
Is stronger than the knife.
And they can kill ya once,
But they can't kill ya twice.
Did you know distruction of the flesh is not the ending to life,
Fear not of the anti-christ.
Did you know that I,
Exist before the earth.
And did you know my eyes,
Are windows to the world.
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and ah wear jerry curls,
Can't tell di boys from di girls.
Your body's just a vehicle,
Transporting your soul.
It's what's inside the people,
Is beauty to behold.
Fear not of evil.
Everyday the flesh,
It grow old.
Changes of the times,
Take a toll.
(hook)x2
me say me want, freedom,
Justice,
Equality.
As it was written in the book of life,
Then;
So shall it be.
Me want to big up marcus garvey and me big up hughy p.
And me wanna know washality.
And I meant, reality.
I see it in the signs,
Everyday I live.
It's clear to my mind,
Somethin' got to give.
The system is the problem,
But it ain't just gonna change.
The people got to fight as one,
To break free from the chains.
We livin in a time,
Where whitey got us cornered.
Shackles on the brain,
Police on every corner.
Lookin for some soldiers,
But they so hard to find.
My elders say be patient,
'cause things come in time.
not fast enough because yo,
They wanna rewrite me history.
I made him a lot of mystery.
'cause we too strong for them dis we.
Because it was,
And now it is,
And it will definitely be.
We know,
The days is up.
Blaze it up.
African warrior,
Raise it up.
Push it up.
Fill up your cup.
We had enough.
We gonna buck.
Now is the time.
Open your mind.
Then you will find.
It's a design.
No matter what you do,
No one can stop the time.
and me want no
Kkk, no cia, no
Police brutality.
Ghetto youth and R.B.G.s,
We ridin for liberty.
Been here,
Before the start.
Still here,
After it's over.
And it's written in every heart,
Of every soldier.

White carpet in my star face house

My IV the twisted reefer and delivering that dough
To the front door like a piece of carrying her own
Always financially she don't need me
She is just in love with a real nigger continuously weedin
At my under closed location my grow space is reading up on vintage V12 engines
and the greatest strains this season
and I grind for that very reason

watermarks still on the houses as i drive by

Captin hook wild'n in the ceiling though no stealin that shit heard i know the feeling

and people I ain't got to name cuz they was probly here gettin high wit me
If you don't know where to put it at than I'll ride wit it
There I try to lose you in the system for some weed in my city
In the heart aint no love or no pity
Looking for charity that dog don't hunt don't come in the woods with it

I really envy the sunshine, baby
I really envy the sunshine, baby
Da-da, sing that song
I would like to alway light your world
If you promise to be forever my baby girl
And I'll take you flyin' high with me
Or we can jus' sit like birds on a branch in a tree
And be free
We fly so high in the clouds
Nobody else is allowed
Up, up, and away we go now
Tell me if I should slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
So you can smell the roses
I think I smell the roses
But then again, it could be heavenly blues
Gone off the Morning Glory seeds is true
I water these seeds for you
From the sea shores on earth to the moon
With sunlight they blossom and bloom
With sunlight they blossom and bloom
(Chorus)
[Brittany Hurd/Santos]
I really, really envy the sunshine, baby
I really, really envy the sunshine[2x]
I would like to brighten up your day
If you promise to be forever my lady
And I'll take you ridin' up the block wit' me
Keep everything you need inside ya, neena
When we ridin' everything seems so sweet
I hold you close when it's time
Your favorite shape is a .9
My girl is one of a kind
She could be blowin' my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind
I gave up Guns and Roses
I take a picture when she poses
But then again she could be murderin' you
Redrum, redrum, want to come get somethin
You's a fool, better keep ya cool
'cause we all playin' by the street rules
In the sunlight is where we learn how to peep fools
Plus put 'em to sleep wit' tools
Better keep ya cool
'cause we all playin' by the street rules
In the sunlight is where we learn how to peep fools
Plus put 'em to sleep wit' tools
Better keep ya cool
'cause we all playin' by the street rules
In the sunlight is where we learn to how peep fools
Plus put 'em to sleep wit' tools

But keep this hennessey and my main man's rap
Caught up in the game black can't explain that
But longevity that's what I aim at
You wanna come through

Sent your clown niggaz back and touch a fuckin hill

Yo combination of mr. cheeks, canibus & kurupt

Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
To past the tongue faster then bullets come out of guns
Who wants to be the one to get struck first
I bury they body on any planet except the earth
I rip up, swell your lip up, it's a stick up
Make put your hands up on your head like you was doin sit-ups
Lost boyz nad dpg causin trouble
We out of control like inter-voluntary hustle
Kid nobody else smokes more then my team
20 grams of weed and a gallon of visine
Yaknahme, I fly the friendly sky's when ever music makes me high
Chorus: I'm so high, this music makes me high (x4)
[kurupt]
Kurupt in your game, what's ya know, where ya at
I'm comin through wit a mack, I'm out to get my paper back
You can't harm me even if lip was froze
Get incinerated from verbal inferno
Born created get physical castrated
I'm so glad I made in a world where I'm hated
Big time gama got the game orcastrated
Correct me mashin in jags and benzes
Imitatin cause youse an imitater punk
Jump wit kurupt and get slumped cause I dump
With no question or no hesitation I'm bussin
End discussion as my adrenaline's rushin
Or ? ? ? your mr. cash for the capital
Was actual, ? ? ? fact I use tactical skill
Get popped like girls tryin ta jump at the real
Chorus
[daz dillinger]
Can I ride, can I rock my broads
Cause ? ? ? rhymes and leathal last rhyme lines
Time after time I beat the hell out of a track
Most definitely I gets busy when we attack
? ? ? ? , dialogues and formats
Be on some ill type streets raps from way back
As a child I got wilder styles
I used to shine all day and a rocked the crowd
I destroy and completely evaporize my opponents
Be on it like a hornet kickin dat in your stomach
Dogg gone it tell my why they wanna kill daz
Cause daz gets the killin and buillin cash rounds
So get tell me I'll come around
So get down lost boyz and dogg pound
I bet ya get see me now tell whatcha gonna do
A tough guy can be a dead guy when fuckin wit my crew
So fasten your seat belt and see a hornets trip
Well me stay hardcore for whatever, whtever
Chorus to fade

I remember the way you used to fuck me
I remember the way you used to fuck me
You can't deny that your fuckin' is so weak
So don't waste my time
(Don't waste my time)
Since you can't use your dick right
You can lick my clit all night

There's a dying breed of realest why they searching
They listen to the fake so the real they aint hearing
I always been a gangsta so I aint shit that I'm fearing
I been through it all something I sould be teaching
Gotta lil son more reason why I'm reaching
I already got money but ill tell u what I'm seeking
to show the whole world I'm one of the realest breatheing
454(better get it right) more than black and white eating
I knw its a long road u gotta stay on it
Success comes to those who really want it
So I stretch my arm and reach for the moon
cause lord knows I was born wit a dirty spoon
When I was a kid I used to wish upon a star
None of it came true the reason I go hard
I see the vision clearly we got this far
I come from the bottom so the stars is the limit
I'm true to myself so I'm far from a gimmick
Hating ass niggas jealous of they way I'm livin
Rags to riches I belved in my vision
Hated by many confronted by none
Respected by all cause the use of a gun
I speak of the pain I speak of the bubble
I stay so hungry yet so humble
Heart so solid that I made it through the struggle
I had to give my people something to trust in
I rep asian and polynesian
They say we couldn't do it so I'm here I aint leaving
Gotta prove them wrong drew deez is the reason
Ima push hard every breath that I'm breathin'
I'm reaching for the stars cause my dream I believe in

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Don't make me put one of y'all in the grave
I'm playing with money, y'all niggas save
The pain I'mma cause is something y'all counldn't face
A couple niggas shot cause one of y'all niggas brave
Rushing him to the ER, rushing me to the stage
This The Soul Tape 3, nothing we need to say
Leave the handguns at home, fuck 'em, just bring the K's
For the homies in the county with nothing that's eating trays
Since I started eating my motto is eat away
Top 5 is always followed by DOA
Thought I was on top when I bottled a key of yay
Then I went straight from the block to the VMA's
The way the hands move on the clock you'd be amazed
You just feel the burn, nigga. you don't see the blaze
Take a good look at my eyes, you see the haze
Right left, live of death either way
Same tough guys will cry when they see you laid
Never show your hand, they dying to see your spades
I'm married to the game, you dying to get engaged
You only gangster when the lions is in the cage (coward)
Your life's worth nothing, the goons had it appraised
I might do the ray for maroon with the beige
Bad bitch with me, Louie with the shades
If you ain't self employed than truly you a slave
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Tooly to your waves, brain on your winter coat
Niggas burning bridges then expecting you to send a boat
If I'm coming at your neck think a bullet in the throat
Never gone forget you niggas, got 'em written in my notes
I'mma send the goons, a snitch gone. send the folks
They gone kill you just cause, don't make me send the locs
New blue hundreds spending c-notes
Fresh pair of Timbs, vintage pea-coats
I'm a stand up nigga, never been a joke
Riding since pedal bikes with reflectors and the spokes
I snuck up from behind, put the game in a yolk
You apply a little pressure and them rookies finna choke
Niggas looking washed up, it's something in the soap
You looking like Adrien Broner in the ropes
My shoes is 2 racks, I should be in the slopes
Might come through in bubble same way they send the pope
Parading down 5th Ave like I'm in a float
That new H50 push button like remote
Control is hard to have, especially when you broke
They sleeping because they eating, but you hungry and you woke
Shorty mouth wet, but her strength is in the stroke
Greatest of all time so her name has been the goat
She say you got the people waiting for it then it's dope
The game is fucked up, but if you back then it's hope, nigga

Is he moving too fast? Is she moving too slow?
She telling me that I'm silly, but I'm only 2-0
And it sucks that she just want to be friends with me
I try to put her on where I'm at mentally
I'm full of energy
At times I need a remedy
For lack of things that interest me
But still her body is tempting me
She just keep rejecting me
Why she keep stressing me?
Screaming like "Don't touch me b****, I don't got leprosy"
Maybe we wasn't meant to be
But I was down Bonnaroo, Tennessee
In the RV, I can shut down a stage
Casey had the veggies on the bus, we smoked a pound of haze
Digress the tree can cold stress
When you feeling a bad b****, but she showing you no interest
Sending letters with no address
And she never gon' get it so let it rest
Does she love me?
No sir
Does she want me?
No sir
I think she hates me
What has she done for me lately?
Does she love me?
No sir
Does she want me?
No sir
I think she hates me
What has she done for me lately?
I'm high with no intent to land
I seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans
Who just wanna rendezvous
I would take her on a date, to a nice restaurant
But I got too much on my plate
Said I'm here for a day
She hit me three hours late
Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face
Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return
But that was based on the premise that she was my concern
Searching for serious, life
Then I was fast
Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious
The kinda chick, the fliest n**** in the school he had her
But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters
I like em usually bad, always on punishment
Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it
And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh?
Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh?
We take the s*** any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic
Only hit the blunt once, then she f***in' pa** it
I knew we wasn't compatible
Quarterback my feelings to the side, that's a lateral
I wish that I could be satisfied
I wish you would let me have a try
But there's a problem with you and I
Now it's Chi-town, do or die

Now it was just another Friday night
I thought I'd take a drive
And maybe catch me a bite
And I knew a little spot down a couple of lights
Where the music was low and the mood was just right
So I slid into a corner booth
Ordered a sweet tea appetizer for two
You was checkin' me out and I was lookin' at you
I decided to ease over and talk for a few
Now I'm not usually the type to be out at a bar
'Cause the late night scene seems to go too far
And I used to be the type to go way too hard
But here I am and baby, there you are
Now I could be wrong
I might be right
I never have believed in love at first sight
But I know
I'm crazy over you
It's the way you look
The way you move
The way I feel from across the room
Now tell me
Tell me it ain't true
I think I got a thing for you
Now I can't believe in this small town
Where we both growed up
That it took this long for us to both show up
And who would have known
That over a couple of cups
In so little time we both learn so much
And you know how these rooms here can talk
Everybody's in this bar is watching us like a hawk
And if it's too much for you to handle,
I could just take a walk
'Cause I'm sure you got a man
And I don't want you to get caught
But if not, you can just roll with me
Hell I'm parked right outside in that SUV
It's funny times like this I just can't believe
Something so accidental is so meant to be
You can call it love
You can call it lust
I never was sure a' what it was
All I knew
It took me by surprise, yeah
From the first hello to the last goodbye
Whenever I'm with you feels like I'm loosin' my mind
I know I've got a thing for you
I've got a thing for you

[Benzino talking softly]
Niggas want to try and live my life and
Bitches want to try and run my life and (As we proceed!)
Haters want to try and take my life and (ha, Benzino)
God...
[Hook]
Niggas want to try and live my life and
Bitches want to try and run my life and
Haters want to try and take my life and
God! Do you really want my life then?
[Benzino]
God hit me with the track, Diddy keep it gangsta
When in the city, crime scene, no answer
Who's Benzino? Who the fuck's Benzino?
Matta-fact, get'cha facts straight (Say whaaat?!)
Nino Brown without the high fate
O-Dog without the O, Nigga you don't know?
Sonny Coleon, Godfather get loose
Bulletproof, made it through the toad booth
I don't know if you niggas want the whole truth
Stay strapped even in the vocal booth
Rob report, page 3-5-7
Ray hang 'em high, details at eleven
[Hook: x 2]
[Benzino]
Do you really want to hold spots down, home Bost-town
Victim of 'stance, we dance with four pound
Spit thug sound, why'all know how thugs sound
Can't touch clowns, slow slugs down
O.G.'s raised me, baby G's praise me
Since I'm a G, rep 3 'til I'm swazy
why'all cats fugazi, my shit's crazy
Niggas can't faze me (You can't take) what God gave me
Game stayed on top of - Fame played a part of
Change, made a lot of - Flame in the hearts of
Men I'm a Made one - Friends, I don't need none
Play it by the rules, took some let some
Once was behind bars, now I'm a All Star
Outlaw to idol, takin all the titles
Whole family 'spect it, whole fam connected
Fuck off the hook, my shit's disconnected
[Benzino softly speaking Hook]
[P. Diddy over Benzino]
Oh, see this is the shit I'm talkin 'bout
'Stead of a nigga doin him, he tryna do me
and stop me from doin me, feel me?
[Benzino]
Stress got me smokin blunts like they're cigarettes
Don't forget, nickel nine leave you soakin wet
Negotiate deals via cellphone
Do shows outta town, bring dollars home
Spread love throughout my hood, my hood love me
Lemme give you some advice, don't never trust me
You gonna pay the price if you ever fuck me
It's like rollin dice, if you try an duff me
Who's Benzino? Know the whole world know
People always scared of shit that they don't know
despite the facts, still here, of course
Fuck 'Five Mics' motherfucker, I'm The Source
[Hook: x 3]
[Benzino talking (P. Diddy)]
Yeah, now what, (what) now what'chu sayin now (Yea)
Huh? You don't really want to
How you feelin about this now?
Huh, Huh? (As we proceed!)
What'chu got to say about this? Huh?
You got somethin to say, about everything else
What'chu got to say about this right here? (What'chu got to say?)
Huh? You can't say shit about this!
Huh? You just gotta keep your fuckin mouth shut!!
[P. Diddy talking]
You need to stop doin me, and do you - you feel me?
It's a simple thought, haha
Sometimes you have your mind so preoccupied on a motherfucker,
you can't even wake your ass up
You too busy dreamin about me!
You motherfucker! I don't even know why I'm talkin to your punk-
Ya, ahhh, it's some fuckin sissy shit even talkin about this, ahh!

The Compton maniac,

Damn!
Suckers, I go for broke so don't choke on the smoke.
Cause if I hit the chronic, Eiht starts the rap bionic.
So enough with that punk shit.
With your fucked up lyrics you can't shoot the gift
like it should be shot.
Gots no hearts, punk ass marks, don't start you'll get got.
And at the end of the trail is what's left.
Is a sucker mutherfucker who done simped to death.
So if ya got static go and gather up your army.

I bet you sorry MC's never seen this.
A sucker punk hung up by his penis.
So watch out for a sucker on the gank

And its the MC Eiht on your shit list.
Commence to killing you off you gots your def wish.
[I'll make you famous...]
[Now when I go for my gun...you can start shooting]
Phase 2, Its the brother who be taxing.
Running over punks like my brother Bo Jackson.

It's the Eiht double M and I'll keep sticking.
All that pay back shit is in effect.
Cause I'm the type a brother who'll blast your ass, check.
So if your biting my lyrics, then fool you'll pay.
As you commence to say em you'll get tooth decay.
So give up to the Compton psycho,
Biting me Quik will mean you get the duck sick quick.
Not a funny man, but still I gives surprises.
Lyrics are deadly plagues, the death toll rises.
So now your shit outta luck with your rhyme scheme.
And now I hunt your punk ass in your bad dreams.
Another victory on my list.
One more punk ass fool with a def wish.
Chorus
Now say your prayers, because its difficult to get with this.
I'll haunt your studio, become your ghost lyricist.
No mistakes I make, so don't fake.
Yous as sorry as fuck, so jump your ass out a cake.

On the stage I'm in a rage with a gangsta show.
The Capital E, The Capital I, the Capital H,
The Capital T, down MC.
Mike T is the partner down with me.
Suckers got static, here goes the G-A-T.
So take a step up and play for the rhythm.
>From Compton boy, and this is what I give em.
A blast from the gat just for talking that junk.
Feel like handling the business might smoke the punk.
I run the nine one, fool, so get hip to my ways.
And don't be no hero like in the western days.
At sundown, you'll press your luck and try to shoot me.
Grab your davey Crocket, I'll grab my gangsta Uzi.
And after all that, you'll still be R.I.P.
If you fuck with me...Fool there's your def wish.
Geah, why'knowutumsayin? MC Eiht stepping to the mutherfuckin 91
My DJ mike T's in the mutherfuckin house.
Down with the DJ Bolo, and Unknown. Geeeaaah.

Yo blaze the fire
Watch the enemies crumble
Sure
See the blood of a slave, eyes of a Banta
Rise from the grave when they listening to Dylan
Action and ways speak clearly like a veteran
Looking both ways when concealing my weapon
I was raised in the gutter fifties for elevens
And a dirty box cutter, I'm standing my ground
Back and forth out of town, I'm getting that cash
And niggaz can't see Babs, if you ain't licking my ass
One tough chick, my flows is not to be fucked with
Send the word out to them bitches that you run with
I'm here now bitches in trouble I spit fire
Quick to bust off like Weebay from the wire
You fucking with the grimiest nigga
Look in my eyes my life was paralleled park until I put it in drive
D.U.I. smacked and broke both of my headlights
Chicks gunning me down running mad red lights
I had low mileage
It was either hugging the block or hip hop
I never been to college, I'm only being honest
Cadillac with the Mac with the serial stretched up in the lining
Now pass me some diamonds with some dudes who move
When I say them good so the hood call me Simon
When I rob I ain't rhyming, I change climates
And break more records than Rice did for the Niners
Them silly one now, all gangstas get them bless
To be wake to be among so many living legends
Nobody stop me don't ask me why
This a real tall guy saying Budda bye bye bye
Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless
To be wake to be among so many living legends
Nobody stop me don't ask me why
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda bye bye bye
Man fuck them other niggaz 'cause I'm down with my niggaz
Yep, we Da Band y'all niggaz ain't fucking with us
Don't make me have to spend that bend and do a pull up
Reach for that 10 that have you duckin' them bullets
Hit you where it hurt it be hard for you to push up
Half-way crook ass niggaz I got you shook up
You walk with your head faced down, you scared to look up
And I know Black and Blue I got the hook up
I stay on my grind BK niggaz know
In your face everyday like a Bad Boy video
On the block for a couple of years
I done smoked a lot of blunts, drunk a couple of beers
The streets know me the hood hold me
I paid dues, I'm the chick in the click
Full of niggaz, I made moves
Stay on top of my game I can't lose
Get down or lay down bitch niggaz better choose
I ride in the biggest trucks all day, call me, shit
I supply the biggest stuff hit the block
Like I'm Cartel blunts ready for something to dump
I feel as though I got the biggest nuts
Wait, move I put blood in your socks, your shoes
Overflowing now you shaking your leg
Man I run with the gage like bacon with eggs
It's white, when I bite when I bake it, it's beige
Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless
To be wake to be among so many living legends
Nobody stop me don't ask me why
This a real tall guy saying Budda bye bye bye
Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless
To be wake to be among so many living legends
Nobody stop me don't ask me why
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda bye bye bye
Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless
To be wake to be among so many living legends
Nobody stop me don't ask me why
This a real tall guy saying Budda bye bye bye
Them silly one now all gangstas get them bless
To be wake to be among so many living legends
Nobody stop me don't ask me why
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda bye bye bye

Trans-siberian epic
Trek through dat next switch
Set it off the roglyphic
Jackal headed dawn of the under
Check it, check one check
You can suck it
Till I get disgusted
Fuck that, naw fuck that
At me wit that weak shit
Bitch slapped
Across the street and back.. head crack
Wanna know where I'll be at whatever
Get off mine I got that juice
Noo style cut your brain stem as my combat boots grind your head to the cadence of this dreath
Stompin mu sick as fuck contagion wagin war with all you knew bitch
Mossberg ballistic flux massive
My shure beta 58a hazmatted
Pump pump slugster radioactive
Ride through a mine field
Laced wit black magic
Straight from the mayday
Naw fuck that (ONE)
Broke off its axis, polar shifted granite
Knock made ta off
Every last bitch on this planet
Fuck that, naw, fuck that
Came ta bad dem brains til dem neck bones crack
Arrested cardiac
Black mass murder rap
Dealer push your wig
All the way back
Head wear your face like a yamakulapse
Never can tell
Where you're at
Eyes stuck on the sky
Always gettin jacked
Tryin ta lookin the mirror like
Fuck that, naw, fuck that

[Intro: Sevyn Streeter]
Shawty swing it my way
What you waiting for baby?
Are you gonna take it?
Won't you please swing it my way
Shawty swing it my way
[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I was out on the town, whipping and swinging
Got my head on a swivel 'cause niggas be scheming
I had just got off the phone, my partner told me "be easy"
It ain't got no definition, we just all know the meanings
I pull up to the spot, told the valet to leave it
Runned into a little cutie she look like Jennifer Freeman
A couple feet to my right, i could see she was speaking
I couldn't hear what she was saying 'cause the DJ was screaming
[Pre-Hook 1: B.o.B]
So I walked over to her slowly, she don't smoke and she don't drink
Well you gon' fail your drug test 'cause all I got is dope D
I know you don't know me, but you could be my only
She whispered in my ear and this is what she told me
[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Shawty swing it my way
What you waiting for baby?
Are you gonna take it?
Won't you please swing it my way
Shawty swing it my way
If you're feeling how I'm feeling then probably
There's a million ways that we can get it started
I'm feeling so naughty
Swing it my way shawty
[Verse 2: B.o.B]
They say it's better to give than it is to receive it
That's why I give her all I got, my bad for overachieving
Get your ass out them secrets from Victoria's Secret
Back and forth with those lips, now that's a verbal agreement
You say your man out of season, he probably cheating
That booty the dumbest, but that head is a genius
You could check out the stroll, you swear I was skiing
Fell asleep in that pussy, woke up, thought I was still dreaming
[Pre-Hook 2: B.o.B]
But then she pull me close and cozy, she don't smoke and she don't drink
Well you gon' fail your drug test 'cause all I got is dope D
I know you don't know me, but you could be my only
She whispered in my ear and this is what she told me
[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
[Outro: Sevyn Streeter and B.o.B, Union]
You looking good shawty, good, sure enough, good enough for me (x4)
So bring it over to me
[Outro: Sevyn Streeter]
I'll love you right, all day and night
Everything that you want, boy already know
So you gonna see, how good it can be, come home with me. oooh
I been watching you from across the room
I wanna know your name, won't you swing my way?
Shawty come my way, swing my way
Oooh, swing my way, swing my way
Swing my way, shawty, oooh

[Hook]
Papa papa parapapa...(x8)
[The Cool Kids]
I got my hands full
the Full Force, Force MD's
Troop's in the tape player
88 cutlass supreme
My 6th grade tape was all eyes on me
nas used that same beat when he spit street dreams
my mom drove a Corsica we was in the back seat
looking out the window imagination real big dreams
I set a new standard for who felt like me
demonstrate a style wild flagrant fouls can't screen
showing you the big picture the complete HD
DVR rewind it back you wouldn't believe
said I bring that old thing back and they couldn't believe it
airfares way more for a trip to Ibiza
the petrol is 5 bucks, I can't believe it
what the fuck is the deal?
We too dependent on that barrel
it's the way of the world
keep shifting it's gears man
I gotta fill up, you want something from in here?
Throw it reverse for some shorty with the works
write my number on some paper then throw it in her purse
as I ride by first things first
9 times out of the 10 that cool shit usually works
it's 70 degrees I'm in a short sleeve shirt
without wearing a jacket put seeds in the earth
I'm growing money trees in my front yard
let me water my lawn
I make it look so easy it hurts
let me get my other dollar back
know I have change cause the chicken wrap don't cost more than I gave fool
man you can keep that buck and all my niggas in the range roves just keep trucking
same picture in the frame so selling suede hats and the rain won't work but one try won't hurt me
lucky number 10's and a rondo jersey
we at the gas station you can get in the front seat

It is dark
But also not
You, are going to rock and roll
And you can hardly wait for the music to begin
When it happens, you will become a part of that music.
You are there, you are going on a musical trip.
The highest, happiest trip that you've ever been on.
Enjoy it, and get into it
Loosen your seatbelts, let's rock and roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
And I would like to be able to continue to...
Let what is inside of me
Which is, which comes from all the music that I hear
You know, I would like for that to come out
And it's not like, it's not really me that's coming
The music's coming through me
Coming out strong!
Presenting to you...
The mayor's Very own
I'd like to just continue to be able to...
Express myself, as best as I can with this instrument
I feel like I have a lot of work to do. Still, ya know
I'm a student, of the drums
And I'm also a teacher of the drums too
The dynamic, the soul
Coming out strong!

But also not
The middle ground between light and shadow
In a few moments, you will have an experience which will seem completely real
It will be the result of your subconscious fears transformed to your conscious awareness
You have five seconds to terminate this tape
Five, four, three, two, one

I'm like the baddest rapper ever
Ever ever? Ever!
I always been it like I stood next to Uncle Fester
Swisher house professor taught y'all how to be successful
Used to Run a house like Rev and Diggy and Vanessa
Yes I got a stretcher that's for competition
Not in my position they ain't got a pot to piss in
You can call it dissin' they stay broke like it's tradition
Fly over the hood (man you must think you) Blake Griffin
Finger itching I got riching
My mother say she loving it
She took a million it took a year til I discovered it
I took my money out and I almost shut down the government
I threw it in the tub and let my main chick rubber dubbing it
The passcode on my bank account is Catch Me If You Can
I know they gay just undercover like they with the clan
Don't throw a rock and later say that you my biggest fan
Remove the mic right now so it don't break and beat you with this stand
Your girl be calling me like everytime she grab a phone
I never hear 'em all her messages be rather long
These losers copying too much and you can't say i'm wrong
Wiz Khalifa hit the joint, now everybody cheech ching chong
A sign that's on my door that say no man but me allowed
Might see your woman drying off in here without a towel
Don't get confused just cause the twitter picture got a smile
... post where you at and i'll come show up now
After I beat you down, twitpic and retweet this clown
I bet in person all these talkers ain't gon' leak a sound
I travel everywhere how come your boys don't be around
Take trips where y'all be missing y'all must live in lost and found
Rap game's a female chat and all y'all do is disrespectful her
Can't really say you fresh cause all of y'all is whack except for
A few it's maybe two yeah most of y'all is pop as Ke$ha
I wanna grab a bottle and just turn your tap to ketchup
I teach 'em how to stunt, super Dave done taught a lecture
See me 2012 and said you fresh as when I met ya
I'm in my robe and slippers walking round like i'm Hugh Heffner
I'm dressed in red your girl is black, jump on her like a checker
King me

Fucking with my thugs and I'm needing my love nigga what
Bone niggas fin to do a little damage

Of course it's the nigga that's takin no shorts
Smokin on the newports your ghetto resource
And bitch you wanna dig your own ditch
and hit you with levels beyond your control
My momma never raised no punks and hoes
Just relear niggas comin up snatchin souls for dough
I know y'all motherfuckers out there somewhere ain't nowhere to hide
Makin motherfuckers feel the vibe for life
In the midst of the twist I'll be down to ride
We're ready for war
Ridin with death
We niggas rappin but still we actin like criminals

We stay heavily sedated comin now back up my buck get shaken
Deeply dreaming about this demon my daddy told me it was comin
Trapped in the form of a bad omen it's wicked it was written I'll be
Runnin while turnin around and blastin back to buck 'em fuck 'em
Them fools come back like I'm ready for war is that all you got
Heard the mack was talkin this and that bout some of my incidents
Said I smoke and snatchin purses you heard this lil EZ told me

My mental seduction run your whole sound suction abduction of lyrics
Is the loss of life love and spirits
Capital offense for generics lost in the prison
Lieutenants overseeing the barracks checkin in
Mark ass copy cat incoherance is crucial
Smokin hay that bite shit like microchips
I watch you ride the rodeo straight to the bottom
When you're fate rotten, bitch

Love is such a funny thing
Just think about it
All the craziness that it can bring
Still we cant live without it
It was so real a big part of me
Then it switched and let me down
Turned me from a sad girl to a mad girl
Now Ive become a bad girl who knows what its all about
But Im so over you
Thought I cant be without you
But Im here rising high and I will never backslide
No I dont need you Im good
Oh life aint bout you so glad I said goodbye
And there aint no way that I will backslide
Maybe in another life we could be together
But I mean it when I say that I
Im done with you forever
Thought I could make you a better man
But you couldnt handle me
You were such a bad boy the ned boy
Now youve become a sad boy and I feel so sorry
And Im so over you
Thought I cant be without you
But Im here rising high and I will never backslide
No I dont need you Im good
Oh life aint bout you so glad I said goodbye
And there aint no way that I will backslide
No Im not going back to sorrow
Dont even wanna know your name
Standing alone but Im stronger than ever
And you wont bring me down again
So done waiting on tomorrow
(Im so done) Things do change
Cause finally I am free I hope youre happy Im so gone
And Im so over you
Thought I cant be without you
But Im here rising high and I will never backslide
No I dont need you Im good
Oh life aint bout you so glad I said goodbye
And there aint no way that I will backslide

Enter the dragon, as I start, to braggin' and taggin'
And sayin' I'm baggin' all rappers on the bandwagon
Feel the fury of a renegade, well men I slayed
So send the aid, cause I penetrate
Bein' the best up, with lyrics I dress up, so don't even mess up
Or try to press up, it's better to fess up
Cause if a rapper ever goes too far man
I start to screamin' on MC's like Tarzan
So witness the glare when I appear
None'll compare, so take a seat in the rear
Child, you gotta understand, you just the man
Sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
Sparkin' the mic like a live wire til I retire
Whatever the comp is I burn em like fire
With all the blow, I hit em hard like PI-YAH
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
And no one grabs a hold, huh
You got somethin' to say, before it's told
If you speakin' on me, you better hablo español
Cause I ain't tryin' to have none of the penty-ante
Mumble jumble kick yak, you better get back
Clear the way when you see me comin' through
Back up and bow, nuff respect due
Uh, I come down and put my weight on it
Drop somethin' straight on it, and sound great on it
Parties erupt, and stages corrupt
I pour like a quart in a cup, word up
I G-E-T the J-O-B done
Makin' the young boys say, "Daddy I don't want none"
You puttin' the man to a boy, before I can even destroy
I played him like a toy Heavens to Merkatroid!
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I ain't about games
I go beyond knockin' em out the box
You wanna be a comedian? Aight, where's Redd Foxx?
So if I want you, believe I'm gonna get you
I wouldn't give a damn if Tony Terry was witchu
So when I come in the same place as my enemy
They all start runin' like their name was Sheer Energy
I won't say what you are but I'll hit you
You're found on a woman and a penis goes in you
Another clue, your first letters are P-U
Act like you know boy, nuff respect due
Uh, put in rotation, better than creation, with acceleration
My vocabulary is very
Clever like a trick hand, sinkin' em like quicksand
Makin' the competition feel like they need a kickstand
To support what they thought would've brought them
Some type of victory, but none of them could get with me
You better never act new
Huh, nuff respect due

Brick house stall-ion, think you tamin me right?
Not this baby Del-Philly streets they raisin her right
Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a LADY!
Need boots pocket books and a baby 380!
But prefer to keep it, calm and cool
When I'm heated I suggest you move
Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove?
Leave her be, chicken squakin hatin frequently
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin me
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin his stuff
Be nicy enough, to let him spend, I'm callin ya bluff
Puttin it down, Ruff Ryders put in they work
Snatched up the illest viscous pitbull in a skirt
(Grrrrrr) Makin em hurt, haters steady dishin up dirt
Changin the game, settin the rules, makin it work, uh
[Chorus]
[Eve]
Leavin em scared, mami takin all of this here
All of this fame I'm hungry hope you cats is prepared
Niggaz, set me up and I'ma take it and run
Think it's a game? Just check out how my format is done
Stoppin your shine, and I do it to perfection
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic to bless em
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test em
Eve handcuff niggaz but I don't arrest em
Shorty-bang hear the niggaz singin, shoutin my name
Make the thuggish niggaz scream, watchin me entertain
Dicks brick when I lick the lips, just keepin it plain
Fantasizin bout this bitch, got em goin insane
Oooh's and ahhh's, 5'7" thick in the thighs
Every thugs dream wife, see the love in they eyes?
My time to shine, whole package make her a dime
Want some more? It ain't over, just keep pressin rewind, uh
[Chorus]
Whether you're in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Republica Dominicana

I been livin' shady
Cheatin' on my lady
Ever since she left me
I been goin crazy
Thinkin bout my baby
I know I did you wrong, jus listen to my song
I wanna make it up to you (2x)
Now I know that you leavin' cuz it feels like I'm not breathin'
Pain up in my chest
at night I can't rest
Cuz I toss and turn this feelin' inside
Oh how it burns to see you go away
And I guess its true what they say
When your heart goes to play, you lose the one you love
That's somethin' that I never thought of
Now you walkin out my life
Without you in my life i got nothin' left
I shulda never came home with hickies on my neck
The hang-ups on the phone aint helpin' your stress
Cuz your tears keep fallin' like rain
I cant erase the pain
I can only try to change
I been livin' shady
Cheatin' on my lady
Ever since she left me
I been goin crazy
Thinkin bout my baby
I know I did you wrong, jus listen to my song
I wanna make it up to you (2x)
I know I aint livin' right
And I don't expect you to take me back
And I don't expect you to forgive me
But baby just listen to me
I been up and down and all around
Searchin' for you baby cuz ever since you left me
I been goin' crazy
I'm losin' my mind
Thinkin' of you all the time
Wishin' i could press rewind and get you back one more time
If I get another try I will never make you cry
I promise to give you the best, nothin' less
Treat you like my princess and love you till the death
Till death does us part you will stay in my heart
Siempre en mi corazon
Siempre en mi vida
For life
Por vida
Tu eres mi chika dalinda
And I plan to make things right
Cuz next time around I'm gonna make you my wife
I been livin' shady
Cheatin' on my lady
Ever since she left me
I been goin crazy
Thinkin bout my baby
I know I did you wrong, jus listen to my song
I wanna make it up to you (2x)
Just tell me what I can do to make it better
I'll do anything
And I'm sorry I made you cry
I cheated and I lied
If there was some way that I could take it all back
I'd do anything
Just tell me
Tell me what to do
Cuz I wanna make it up to you
I been livin' shady
Cheatin' on my lady
Ever since she left me

You know I'm doin' this song to make it up to you baby
I just wanna let you know I'm real
And I'm here for you, no matter what happens

Wake up in the mornin', oh, shit
Had to cock the 9, niggas tryin' to steal my bitch
Run out the back door, see them niggas hit the fence
I'm tellin' you, life ain't Compton, it's a bitch
Let off a couple shots, goddamn, I missed
Sayin' fuck it anyway, let off the whole clip
I'm not to be fucked with when I'm off liquor
Old English in my system 'bout to kill me a nigga
See, I remember back in the days, loadin' my A.K.
Ridin' 'round in my Impala with my lungs full of haze
That's when I didn't give a fuck, now I got my sons
Shoot a nigga, he die, public enemy number one
But this ain't no action flick, no Johny Depp shit
When the TEC spit hollow tips in your Lexus
So, don't fuck with a Compton nigga
When he packin' a gat, yeah nigga, I stay strapped
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?
Or the old school sittin' on glaze?
What could it be?
It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I'm 'bout to roll a swisher
'Cause that's what real niggas do when they at home
Watchin' E.S.P.N. on a 70 inch flatscreen
K.G.'s away Jersey blowin' chronic that green
Gave up the hoop dreams, bubble with the crack dreams
Turn hood zombies into an Olympic track team
Till I got got shot and infiltrated the rap scene
Had to clear my life up, Doc. gave me the vaccine
Don't get it twisted, I still click clack things
Red beam attached to each and every strap
That I keep locked up in my basement
If I shoot a nigga will I be known
For gettin' Jason, I don't know
Still got a sick phase for shoot outs and car chases
Fuck Paccino 'cause we know niggas with scarred faces
And we go back like D-boys with small faces
And we crashin' them Ferraris like y'all hate me
Pharrell I think it's
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?
Or the old school sittin' on glaze, what could it be?
(You know they ass is full)
Niggas can't fuck with me, will stit
I guess I am a motha fuckin' legend, Will Smith
All I'm missin' is a bitch like Jaya, Bonnie and Clyde shit
Hit the fence like later, Syonara or we the dirt shit
Black rose phantom interior hurt shit
And I got some kisses from a couple Brooklyn bitches
Them hoes, they never testify, Beefs to Common
But Game keep it hood like Weez and top Rommy
Never stop comin' for the top
If it bakes a flesh wound if Feralla headshot
Motha fucka and when he take aim, bullets into your frame
My boss and allowed to when trigga swallow your vein
Can't walk through the club and take a piss
Without these new school rap niggas on my dick
Why you fuck around with you jewelry and all your wrist?
I pull up with your bitch pumpin' gangsta shit, now you know
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?
Or the old school sittin' on glaze, what could it be?
Do you thing shawty, do your thing shawty
Do you thing shawty, err'body lookin' now
Do you thing shawty, do your thing shawty
Do you thing shawty, err'body lookin' now
Go, go, go, go, go, go, err'body lookin' now
Go, go, go, go, go, go, err'body lookin' now

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah
In school I was skinny, my homie told me "I'll show you things"
Then he taught me how to take a soda out a coke machine
Hurry up before it ring, wrote a letter to the bing
Life can get you screwed and ya it's true, my homie's on a lean
Hit the money spot, couldn't pull no money out
Went to Pen and Pixel, asked to help 'em with the Photoshop
Knew the pictures wasn't real, Pen and Pixel known to crop
Now they takin pictures of the drop when I unfold the top
Uh, my father put me in a Levi
Couldn't afford to step in a Huarache or a Fila
Psychic walked up to me, asked me if I wanna see my
Future, I told her "no because my future is to be fly"
Uh, I got my sky miles up
Successful just ain't in sight, I guess I found my luck
Said every chick I'm around in that H-Town messed up
Especially to have the privilege of an all night tuck (yeah)
[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
I got the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I knew I would be, I knew I would be successful
I knew I would be, I knew I would be successful (yeah)
I knew I would be, I knew I would be successful
[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Said I was dressin tacky (yeah), while they was dressin in khakis
Walked in the gymnasium, back when
they didn't attack me (yeah)
Pictures that they attach me that say "that I miss you badly"
Wonderin how it feel to realize that you could of had me (could of had me)
Even in Spanish little Kelly was lookin cute
The usages of her tongue could never be good as you
It was Quito (yeah), Ecuador (yeah), Lima (yeah), Peru
Who knew that I would of flew? to every city that she spew
Interview and I ain't even have no time for dinner
But no one cares that you're skinny when they feel that you a winner
Women want to be with you, even if you a beginner
Want you to stay the night even if you ain't really finna
You enter, the room and she's watchin out the corner
Her eye on you, realize that she got barely nothin on her
She gets off of the bed and then says "follow if you wanna" (yep)
She hops in the jacuzzi and says join her (yep)

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Burning in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be popping, robbing and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From YO to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flying, up 129
Up the school street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, get at me nigga
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
The cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
The calm before the storm
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo
Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya
With the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play rats and raise stacks
Payback's a bitch, didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you get mud
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real
Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Give to nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first I'm sold an eight, then told it's not an eight
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me the way
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly
Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy
For real

Mami all on me cause I'm touchin' her belly
I'm on butter Pirelli's
Wit' purple and yellow, hello
That's butter and jelly
I flip butter on Celly's
All right in front of the deli
Holly, Lilly, to Kelly all spent once on the telly
(And what else) and I got hella gear
My earring is nice the price
Three town homes in Delaware
Uh tomato Porsche lookin' like tomato sauce
Hip hop hooray I got to get
That ya yo off
That's blocks to the ave, cops come blocking the
Ave, I put the glock in the stash
slabs and copped in the trash
Still stop and I laugh, ma put
Them rock in your ass, the rest
twat in ya bag, dag, hop in a cab
Play you for what
You gon' play yourself
Ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself
And my weight of the wealth was SK, AK, mayday, payday dog
Don't play with your health
[Chorus]
Mami she open she open,jump off hopin' I'm hopin'
grab her rope em' and dope em'
Oral choke em' and choke em'
I flip bundle to bundle, tryin' to double my double
at the same time for what but the cops say I'm
I get fresh from
Yankee stadium to the garden I beg your pardon
Stop it, my closet, Macy's men's department
Pants, shirt, scarf, phone if you check it
Get the scoop on the cologne, belt, and shoe section
Fur for fur baby, baby you'll go stir crazy
Got that David Yurmen burnin', the bird gazey
You'll get hurt play me, burp let the dirt chase me
Every third lady that flirt, want my chirp lately I know
Some RNs that still strip, when I and this real dick, in
The clinic, no student can heal shit
Better than college, after that, students home
At least after your bid, ain't no student loans
To pay back, jack, ask what do you condone
Hit towns wit coke, a 45 blue as chrome
Now they done juiced Marone, knock, knock are you at home
I'm a call he, girls call the crib
And ask are you alone Killa
[Chorus]
We race foreign cars, custom models, drop top mustard Tahoe
We like the musketeers, trained by cus d'amato
Just a model, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow
Watch Sanford in son I'm like the buzz in rollo
Afourtuniado, the Porsche Apollo, wars a follow
Got the mack jack, still swing swords like Zorro
We jackin' and clappin' y'all just applaud like bravo
Now I plaud the Cappo, Zeke and Santana
I don't razor wrist's, I keep eighths of piff
The games and the chick like kobe I'm a rape the bitch
Razor grips, laser spit, Glock cocked J or fifth
D on the block just like Jada Kiss
Haters shift, plead the fifth, spray
The fifth, gator kicks, ma-tr-ix, major chips
I'm your favorite killa, Dipset, Dipset

Flow 'round by the wind

[Layzie Bone]
Ride wit me
Ride wit me
Who is that cun wit the tongue
Like the double X ward
Talking out the neck
Like we wouldn't push forward
We murdered you niggas
And rap suckas
While you niggas
And we leave our competition
Like where was none for us
Shit got board
Back the to hood to the thugs and fiends
Sold crack in the hood
Took my money
And my Trophies
And my Plaques back to the hood
Niggas weren't going out Hollywood not bone
We keep it gutta
Thuggish, ruggish from the 99
My paper hustle
Been around the world a couple of times
Check the record
You can see I am work-in double time
Give 'em something they can feel
When I'm on the grind
Let the gangstas ride
In the summa time shine real bright
If you wanna get down
Let the top back slow
Take a drag of the dro
Flippin' hard time now
You can burn that now
[Chorus]
I Flow when I go
In flo' mo', In Flow motion

Try and keep up to the rhythm
Of the nigga really figga you handle

When I stomp on these
Some niggas at random

Run in hood, while they run around

Come from bone bone
Never be anotha fag

They talk a lot but never got the balls to play
Niggas better not
Look at all this weight

But if they ever fizzle to the Gristle
Blow the whistle,
On the swizzle its official

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Can I stay with you tonight?
'Cause I don't think that I'm alright
I need to find a piece of mind
'Cause I messed up just by design
And I don't even trust myself
Baby, I could use your help!
What's on your mind, baby, let me know
I don't really wanna go, go, go
'Cause I'm not into leaving
I'll be scratching, kicking screaming
Girl, I'm feeling
Can I stay with you tonight?
And we'll do something that's not right
Can I stay with you tonight?
I wanna stay with you!
You might be just as fucked as me
But I still need some company
Maybe we'll take each other down
And we can face that on the ground, ground, cause
I'll be so mistreated
I'll be scratching, kicking screaming
Girl, I'm feeling
Can I stay with you tonight?
And we'll do something that's not right
Can I stay with you tonight?
I wanna stay with you!
OK! Flip!
Home dance, the king with the blue wrist
Counting coke on the table with a sworn fish (damn!)
I promised myself one thing
Married to the success, keep the diamond ring!
She want me, wants me to stay in
I ain't drop, but I'm swimming in the... Benz
Poor model, what a short thing...
Flashbacks over high school, about gym
Now I'm just high with school women, girl
Me and you is just possible to be just friends?
Had sex one time, then you moved in (what?)
No ... got something on your girlfriends.
Can I stay with you tonight?
And we'll do something that's not right
Can I stay with you tonight?
I wanna stay with you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna stay with you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I stay with you?
I don't want to wake up, I wanna go back to sleep
Take my chances on the lottery
Doing nothing is fine, if it's nothing you need
I can always find love for...
Yeah, I got a real job, but I'm already late
Can I blame the boss for not enough sick days?
Just laying, no passing time with my forties and dimes
I'm a loser from 9 to 5!
I wanna be lazy
Don't wanna go outside today!
I wanna be lazy
Don't care if I've got bills to pay!

We're going to learn to hear words with vowel 'A' sound
Listen with care
I be the analog arsonist, aimin' at your arteries
All seeing abstract, analyze everything
Adding on, absolutely abolishing
Average amateur's arsenal just astonishing
Next, we'll learn words that begin with letter 'B'
I be the big, bad body rockin' Bombay to boulevard bully back
Better bring a bomb to the battlefield
Bloody black beats bringing bottoms that boom
Basically build barriers bewilder buffoons
Listen now to words that begin with letter 'C'
Crazy character, constantly creating concoctions
Catalyst, a cannibalistic rhymes conqueror
Correctly connecting, craniums crumble down
Consistent capacity
Next we'll hear words that start with letter 'D'
Done did that done did this diddle don
Domination don't dignify diction
Doin' it deep down dialect daring
Doomsday dut devastate during the duration
Listen to our song for vowel 'E'
Extraterrestrial electrical, effortless
Eons of energy, everyone affected
Efficiently epitomize excellent
Extravagant elevate where the essence is
'F' is the letter with which these words begin
Blackalicious got funk for the future filling up fiends finally
Fabulous, furious, fatness, follow me
Niggers fall frequently, fact
Verbal felon fired up federally foundation fadin' all of this wack shit
You will listen carefully again to words with sounds for letter 'G
I be the gift of gab, the man with the given gift of gab
Man with the gift of gab
I possess the gift of gab, gift of gab, gab
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I, got the gift of gab
When I shoot the gift, I shoot, I use the gift of gab like a harpoon
On the serious tip, I'm equipped with a gift
The gift of gab, it don't waiver
Yo man you gotta, grab the mic to show you got the gift of gab
These are the letters B, C, D, and F
And then comes the letter G

Better ride
You in tune to the sounds
Of the dance floor giants, 69
And we come to make you dance
And I brought my dogs wit me

Hold up, wait a minute

Let's ride and ride it all day
Hands down, shake up, we all up in the mix
And it's about time we all break it down
And it goes a little something like this
Yo, dog, you see a little something you like?
You say, here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie
And she lookin' all good in the club tonight
You say here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie
If you's a dog and you need a fix
Here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie
We've been trying to tell y'all for years

And when the bass of his glip
Well, ya must be in tune to hear what we hear

Woof Woof (x 24)

I'm on my night job, my niggas riding my city understand us
See a hundred bandits, each put a hundred bands up
They can't call us bandits no more
Same hood, same corner store
But them same old hoes ain't wearing panties no more
I'm on my night job, slim waist with them fat thighs
Never been baptized, but she soak me all in her holy water
I'm one of five, she the only daughter
She ain't used to sharing, I ain't used to caring
Let's play truth or dare
Cause lately my lifestyle's like dynamite
I'ma go lights out like dynamite
Smoke one, that I might
I'm on my night job, always knew how to play these cards of mine
Fuck rap, we seen harder times
Jump back like Vinny Carter prime
I'm on mine
I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it
Aye baby, I'ma take it low
I'm on my night job, y'all niggas jivin', I'm back up in position
Earnhardt, I'ma catch some nigga slippin'
Burn hard on a track and get to whippin'
I'm on my night job, why is it always blacks that get detention?
For my nigga with the pass to get the flip in
Boy that trap is a accurate description
I'm on my night job, finally got Bassy off the corner
'010 niggas thought he was a gonner
He ducked shots, now it's "Bas we gotta phone her"
I'm on my night job, flew the posse out to Rome and
Won't tell you 'bout no Basquiats don't want 'em
Nigga word to Selassie, I'm zonin'
I'm on my night job
Got old niggas tryna bite cause they can't capture
The feeling from days 'fore the game passed 'em
Niggas out here lookin' like a bunch of Dame Dash's
Nicorette, that's patchwork
That ain't better than your last work
Cigarette, let the ash burn
Omen said don't worry 'bout the last word
I'ma hit the gas swerve on 'em, Skrrr
Too high to riot, that's my best excuse for being lazy
Being an artist, that's the best excuse for being crazy
I've been so infatuated, went to Clark and graduated
Now she on my face time and my nigga she just masturbated
Fuck a album release party, I'm out in the streets shawty
How many rappers I killed, counted at least 40
Nah I ain't God, but shawty down on her knees for me
I'm horny like that Coltrane album
A Love Supreme, that's cold fame album
Lately I've been dancing like a Soul train album
Lately silly making songs bout how they hate me
They've been loving me this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
Killed my ego now I'm snappin' like it's '09
With a gold mine of inspiration for y'all
Fuck your co-sign, that nigga can't fuck with Cole neither
Don't ask for a feature, We bring a whole liter of Ether to eat ya
We gotta eat for niggas, keep reachin'
If these bullets was heat seeking they wouldn't even reach you niggas
I'm on mine

They say that if it works, don't fix it
Go against the law, might get a bit risky
No offense to y'all, but I feel a bit gifted
So I think my odds are about 50/50, crispy
O.K. Corral, we about to put it down
Take 10 and turn around, go and pull your pistols out
But what is this about, all these grenades and handguns
Magnús Ver Magnússon, strong set of hands, son
Tall, dark, handsome, holding y'all for ransom
Strong arm Lance so scared that he can't run
'Cause when a man comes face to face with his fears
He gets weird, he can't hear, he can't see things clear
I be sincere, yes dear, guests here
Press gear, dress queers, fresh in my neck beard
Next year, net year, jet Leer, get near
Top tier, drop tears, no way not here
'Cause there's no crying in baseball, and that's that
"There'll always be a case called when Ash rap
Bars will take your face off, no cat scratch
Go ahead, ask Wreck racks on racks, yea that
For a pat on the back after I black
Tackle and straddle a calf without impactin' my breath
Climb the ladder of success, skipping and missing a step
New edition of spittin', you should've listened to Flex, it's like
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no
Slick Dickies, no one can stick with me
Spit it out quick, as soon as the shit hits me
Kill swiftly, been ill since Stick Stickley
Double dip dibs, I dibble and bust quickies
Nifty little shit, I do it while dressed thrifty
Pricks just stiff, my stick is so shifty, sick
Fred McGriff with the hits coming lefty
Used to be for free, now the seats never empty
It's elementary, yeah I heard it in assembly
Principal was telling me I'd better go ahead and read
Never be a better me, better off dead or me
Not really a better, but I'm betting that I'll better be
Better with the rhetoric, set it up and let it rip
Aw better forget it man, kid's a fucking lunatic
Looney Toon, lunar eclipse
Every blue moon, might see a few shooting strips
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know
I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no

Chorus
Haven't you heard
platinum makes the amateurs swerve
Nature, Noreaga like Magic & Bird
call a timeout, make a quick sub
pull ya rhyme out, and rip it up
nigga rip it up!
Nature:
I shook hands wit many killas
some did it for fun
it's like a rush the way it comes
to make the innocent run
niggas brag abotu it
and recapture the pain
just to see a young brother getting snatched from his frame
its many ways to do it
anger plays a major role
when its done its done
don't try to save ya soul
you'll be amazed how quick police learn the businss
nowhere to run young blood
you done burned ya bridges
a nervous wreck
makin ya calls collect
confessing ta hoes
a man of respect
now a vegetable
scorned by the world
for being cold-hearted
he killed one of his own
it's fucked up but he sold product
no can do, he got cancelled
I watched'em as he tried to pull out
but he never got a chance to
just a little man, his bite less than his bark
yo he thought he had a name ti; niggas tested his heart
lossed stripes in the street
at nights and sleep at the same time
I used ta send'em ta stores and make'em rhyme
had a seed on the way
smoke weed all day
thunwas speedage
didn't think the heat would freeze'em
I tried to tell'em
correct'em like convicted felons
by the time he realized
it's to late, a slug split his melon
seen'em spralled out from the fourth floor
in the blink of an eye
it was over the killa walked off!
CHORUS 2x
Noreaga:
A yo we thugged out, wit ILLWILL on some city shit

y'all need to stop frontin'
actin' like y'all big dollar
fraudulent fucks I stay calling ya bluff
causing friction
calling ya chickens, for a quick buff
rippin'em up to some Lou Rawls shit
it ain't a game, you was hot
but you lossed it
change ya methods
renevate quick to save the extras
ya mic's hooked up
but y'all brains ain't connected
it ain't my fault ya niggas came defective
I'm the specialist at rap
opposite of pessemis
shots more accurate than Petrovic
when my shit drop
y'all niggas better check for it
ya gotta love it, the way I'm comin' at you
in the purest form
the wars on, you thought we would flop
well than ya thought wrong!

[ The Fresh Prince on the phone ]
Hello?
Yeah, this is Prince, who's this?
Yo, what's up baby, how you doin?
Oh, I'm tryin to see you on a personal tip
You know that, right?
Heh
Ah come on
You been tellin me that for years
You're a little bit older than me, you know?
You're 30 years old and I'm 20
Age ain't nothin but a number, baby
Hey look, I'm young but I'm real strong
Heh
Hey look, I know that, I know, I know
I can't sport you around in my Benzito
And take you out to dinner and be seen
You know
That's cool, though
I tell you what
I tell you what
Got a remedy for this problem
This is what I want you to do
I want you to get a globe, right?
I want you to spin the globe, spin it hard baby
Pick anywhere in the world
And I'll take you there
We'll be together, alright?
You with that?
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Greek mythological gods are inferior
Studs and playboys, come on, I'm superior
Any man can look and see where the curves are
It takes a real man to find where the nerves are
Women like huggin, kissin and carressin
And eh - ssssslooowww undressin
Calm down, chill out, take your time, dude
Don't be all rough and fast like a monsoon
Women are soft and fragile, you know delicate
It's really not appealin to then when the fella gets
All worked up and rushes to the pinnacle
You might think so, but yo, they ain't with it though
Candlelight dinner, just you and her in a
Nice restaurant is always a winner
Then ah - if she is first rate and on the first date
She says no, be patient, don't push her, just wait
Because a woman is a gift to a man
They like you +real+ hard but with a gentle hand
So get your act together cause if you're trippin up
If you're slippin up, then F.P. is pickin up
All of y'all slack men, cause what you're lackin
I fill up, so ain't no need to come back, man
Everything ain't always the way that it seems
I'm the Fresh Prince, baby doll, and I'm the man of your dreams
[ Jazzy Jeff on the phone ]
Yo, what's up
Yeah, this Jeff
Yeah, I heard you talked to Prince today, huh?
Yeah
Let me guess
He's 'young but strong'
Yeah
I kinda figured that
Let me ask you a question
Did he kick the 'globe' line on you?
Yeah, I thought so
I heard that before too
Look, I'm not into geography
So I'm not gonna ask you to spin no globe and point to where you wanna go
Or spend no dollars or even do back-semis when I come in the room
Because I'm not into that
You know, all I'm askin for is 60 minutes of your time
And I can set the whole record straight
You know what I'm sayin?
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
I'm not tryin to say nothin that's hard or complex
Or get you psyched with a pose or body flex
I win your lovin with a paid vacation
You know, I'm more into a intellectual stimulation
I make your mind feel good, your body follows it
I pour lovin in, your mind swallows it
I'm not dissin Prince, cause he's my friend
But boys'll be boys and men'll be men
Ladies, your battery's unstable?
Jazzy Jeff got the world's best jumping cables
14'000 volts of pure intimacy
That's enticin to you? Yeah, it was meant to be
Don't debate the great flow of fate
Let he who's Jazzy have you concentrate
Think of me and you makin love as a team
I'm Jazzy Jeff, baby doll, and I'm the man of your dreams

French Montana Ft. Mac Miller - Smoke & Drank

I be ticking like a time bomb ready to explode
And when I do aint no telling how far Ima go
I got a hair trigger attitude, watch what you say
Beside I aint shot a stupid motherfucker all day
Ive been waiting for the right time and this is it
Let me introduce myself, mudface bitch
Just another spirit jumping into the soul
Of a well known killa that be out of control
Chorus (x2)
What are you gonna do
(another face on the totem pole)
When I get there
(another face on the totem pole)
Muddy Muddy
This is my time to shine, Ima show you what Im made of
Strong like a dinosaur but silly as some trippy drugs
Smacking yall in the face with a laugh
Funny bone of the totem pole, do the math
Resurrected from the past on,
Learn the history of these warriors because we may not last long
The silhouettes you see are just thoughts of me
Ready to open your mind and feed it energy
Chorus (x2)
My microphone is like an eagle feather very extinct
Too hot to hold so dont even think about it
Cant nobody do it like me cause Im just a ghost
And I dont need to breathe faster than the blink of an eye
Top notch speed, you cant see me
I guess thats why Im so underground
Cause a native like me dont be fucking around
Chorus(x4)

Oh, she told the DJ, "Pardon me, I need some Swishahouse
Color Changin' Click and Boss Hogg and Wreckin' Yard in my life
Well, a 'Slow Loud And Bangin' CD, some Screwed Up Click and
A little Sucka Free 'cause that's what I need in my life
Yes, it is, well, well"
She say she listens to my music but she can't get into it
She don't like it regular speed, she like it when they screw it
What I'm fin to do is call Ron and Watts on my phone
Tell 'em slow it down so the ladies can get they grind on
Yellow, red or brown bone, call me when your guy's gone
If you gotta shake that lick, them haters get they diet on
She's the type rich men will give money for some action
Said, she's light skinned and and she'll strip for Andrew Jacksons
Gets excited when she be jamming them F Actions
Turn the lights off then and if you wanna get your grind on
Just go pick up that phone then just get your dial on
Call me up, I'll come over and help you turn your smile on
She told the DJ, "Pardon me, I need some Swishahouse
Color Changin' Click and Boss Hogg and Wreckin' Yard in my life
Well, a 'Slow Loud And Bangin' CD, some Screwed Up Click and
A little Sucka Free 'cause that's what I need in my life
Yes, it is, well, well
She's calling me on my phone
Telling me she's feeling freaky, her body's in need of me
Hoppin' in on my 4's, grabbing my chopped and screwed CD
And my gray T A P E, y'all know, playas get chose
Color Changin' Click CD, Michael Watts, OG Ron C
Even your neighbors knew just what I came to do
They seen the navy blue, choke on a things of two
They know it ain't your boo, they heard us banging Screw
Making the headboard bang, while I'm banging you
Giving you a work out like a trainer do
Hit it then I flip you over to change the view
My sex is a weapon that's aimed at you
Finish and reload just like a gang banger do
You little angel, you that's what your friends think
They didn't see you sipping on that red drink
Getting drunk while I hit it on the sink
In the kitchen and I'm switching, I can hit it till the bed sink
You can lock the lock, I'm fin to rock the twat
I'm fin to give your friends something new to talk about
Fin to give it to you, shorty, he gon' feel it in your body
Every time Ron and Michael Watts, chop a spot
I ain't forgot about true DJ Screw
'Cause if it wasn't for Screw wouldn't be nothing to do
No claiming red, no claiming blue
It wouldn't be nothing to bang while I'm banging you, jeah
She told the DJ, "Pardon me, I need some Swishahouse
Color Changin' Click and Boss Hogg and Wreckin' Yard in my life
Well, a 'Slow Loud And Bangin' CD, some Screwed Up Click and
A little Sucka Free 'cause that's what I need in my life
Yes, it is, well, well"
She said, "Koopa, I know you be checking these niggaz
But can the ladies get a lil' love, yeah"
I don't discriminate the race, pretty face, pretty shape
Shaped like figure eight, she can get a little steak
We can end a date like a episode of Ricki Lake
Call a couple of your friends, see if they participate
Get on my three way, now, what is the delay?
I pull out the video cam and show you the replay
I screw you real slow like a H Town DJ
We could jam Bun B and that U to the G.K
And a little Sucka Free, ain't enough for me
Big M O E gotta give me the whole S.U.C., they'll screw it
Yeah, money over B.I. to the T H to the E S
In the streets shake the peace, everybody respect the streets
Everybody'll shine from the neck and teeth
Gotta give me the S.P.C., Trae and Dougie D
Free that nigga Z-Ro and that Pimp C 'cause they'll screw it
Girl, I get you wet, girl, I'll kiss your neck
And I know that the sex sure to make you sweat
I show respect to the Swisha vets
And the Screwed Up Click G's, get respect
Lil' O and C N O to the E, 'Face and Willie D
Big Pokey, Flip and E.S.G., they'll screw it
Yeah, slow jam ain't a slow jam unless it's a screw jam
Can't listen to it, no other way, gotta be screwed up
DJ Screw, rest in peace

Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison

All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame

Yo whassup P?
Yo nuttin man just coolin kick back in the studio wit DJ Scratch
And my man Frank B, reminiscin about how we was tryin to shop
Our demo and everybody was dishin, you know what I'm sayin?
Yo P tell em whassup man
We was coolin in my car one day you see
Clockin a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin, the fingers start to snappin
E and I was coolin, Brooklyn spirits we was snappin
In and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Corner rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
On the way to shop my demo, and the car overheated
Feelin real low, low enough to die
Holdin up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And all we kept sayin was please listen to my demo (listen to my demo)
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
When I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin
Thinkin if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin, and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played (?)
People start to smile inside we buckwhylin
Sayin this all started back from freestylin
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, "Yo G, where do we sign?"
Went in the backroom, things was luvy duvy
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos
And all I wanted was somebody, to listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo

T-t-t-t talking about
Fuck up outta my business
Everybody wanna talk
Everybody wanna laugh
But they don't know shit, they just runnin' they mouth
Everybody feel like but they dont know me
But these motherfuckers don't know what they're talking about
Talking about, talking about, talking about
T-t-t-t talking about
Fuck up outta my business

[Verse 1]
Girl I double dare you, to keep it all
Then be 100 with me
If I may not gone lie, I'm scared to
I know you got something to tell me
Cause you're fucking up, [?]
So baby tell me where you were
I'm sick and tired, I know you saw me calling
Think I should've [?] for a while now
[Pre-Hook]
Feels so confused when you say that you don't need me
It's only you that's making you wanna leave me
How is this trust? I lost it, when you let them fuck
Yeah you did yup
Girl I lost it, I lost it
How could you give it up?
[Hook]
Cause girl you did, that one thing
It's fucked up, the way you did that one thing
And I don't care if you was drinking, smoking with your girls
And feeling it, how could you consider it?
Feels so inconsiderate
I already made you been [?] and living it
Stop acting so innocent, cause you be on that other shit
[Verse 2]
Baby how can I compare you?
To a queen or a diamond in the rough, I'm scared to
Can't even recognize you
Don't wanna look at your face, you make me sick I'mma throw up
When roses turn blue-ish, that means your garden ain't true yeah (True yeah)
I know you let them eat it, yes you did yup
Taking food of my plate
[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]

[DJ Premier scratches]
Pure microphone magic
Carving up mc's, straight up torch their weak embellishments
Getting it
Put it on
Dirty download gigolo with the illest flow
Yeah
Perverted Monk high chief
[Afu-Ra]
Life Force moving swiftly
Pitch forks steady miss me
My renaissance, my brother's light eclipse me
My rough callous feet stomping on these city streets
Fuck that turn the other cheek
Unless you squeeze a peach
No parental advisory, so no need for the bleeps
No comin' in my crib unless you wipin' your feet
I hit the street, I feel good plus complete
A lotta hot rappers ain't nothing without their beat
Mark my name, on the clipboard, I gets raw
When I was sixteen, that's when I used to rip for it
Like Jiminy Cricket, hopping over the candle stick
Watchin' my ass, and yo I learnt quick
I'm nifty, shifty with my dirt, G
Doing my thing, put in work, ain't nothing hurt me
I bring it from front to back, white to black
Shoe to hat, use clues I'm doin? that
Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
You feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, you do your thing
Caress the mic like a baby to make your head bang
Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Carve my name in your brain, make your head bang
Monumental, thoughts flowing sequential
The quintessential mental, tapping into
My focus, take it round like a rental
And if I have to cut you with my gonzo
I'm like a warless sword, I'm digging into
Like you can joust defence
So many strokes and slashes let off
You ain't got not fingerprints
Carve you up with my Rambo, ammo
Looking like leather-face, trippin' on the dance floor
Too much hypocrisy, up in the market, be
It ain't about talent, it's all about the currency
My magna opus, addicted plus the dopest
Maybe I'll write a line and fara canna quote this
They got status but can't work the apparatus
How could a project sell millions
Talking 'bout millions, when half their buyers ain't seen a thousand
Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Caress the mic like a baby to make your head bang
Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Carve my name in your brain, make your head bang
Times is kinda critical, that's why I gotta keep it lyrical
Simple and plain, 'cause I don't want to riddle you
I'm tryin' to black out, 'cause I'll blow your back out
Pullin' my axe out, do a M.O.P. mash out
With my dreads out, an' I ain't no type of boy scout
Mr Life Force, but you call me The Count
Got so many names, that I can't even count
Let's see: Paisley, 5th Thaing, Mr How, Dr Intergalactic
My other names is under the mattress
Now you can get your grades pissed on
After your body's been buried
From trying to get your diss on
Wax off, wax on
My calm is bringin' a storm, from the night until the early morn'
I got so many styles, forget the grape with wine
Life Force on the mic, an' 'bout to put it on
Takin' you ass away like I was Kogon
Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Caress the mic like a baby to make your head bang
Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Carve my name in your brain, make your head bang

I was thinkin' 'bout somethin'
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Remember when I was strugglin'
Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed
Money wasn't comin'
For sure nigga I kept frontin'
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way
And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I gotta get it
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the Coney
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way
It's the same old shit
Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killin' me
Niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim
Fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' out
Doubling my money gettin' my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em (WOO!)
I had my dubs on the step
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth
Flipping the truth, while you're running and chatting
Thinking you're realer than Scru
You ain't so why you act, dummy
You think you bad, well that's funny
I'm try'na get Maybach money
I'm a Mac Miller, spittin' ASAP, rookie
I had them dubs on the step

Man i got my dark glasses on cuz im ready for the big lights
all my money counted all my rubbers skin tight
me i always stood out you was more the in type
i never follow suits you was more like pin stripes
ridin in ye's maybach smokin so its cloudy
3 girls who spent all day doing paloties
gettin money niggas think i joined illuminati
throwing westside up i'm feeling like killuminati
well isnt it ironic that im in a big body
paranoid cuz every rapper named big got bodied
boi and my bitch got bodies, but i sit her in the back
cuz my nigga called shottie
and im a G O til im an og rockin something high end like a
fuckin od they feel a nigga from ny to the oc
if we down in the fourth quarter i take it to ot
take it to 1-0 just take it as 0 and me chillin in the hot spot
cuz i never get cold feet nigga you on the sidelines praying for an audable
cuz when your legendary everything is quotable
prolly zipped his affordable order what you cant afford matter afact order more
and i think ima have the same thing my whole team gettin cash
i just call it gang green niggas on the tracks ye be on the tracks this where kobe and lebron
root for the same team
could live my life blind fold cuz every time my eyes close i just fuck around and see the same
thing yeah i just tend to see the same thing they say its meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with good and been living a changed

Oh wretched man- the problem ain't that we rock Timbs
That I am- the problem is we've got sin
Who shall deliver me?- even with a new start
From this body of death?- we need to be freed, we need a new heart
Oh wretched man- the problem is not just behavior
That I am- the problem is there's rot in your nature
Who will deliver me- even with a new start
Our Lord- we need to be freed, we need a new heart
We're in a hip-hop era full of hip-hop errors
Not just the block but the heart's what hip-hop mirrors
Somebody told me that we're not naughty
I objected and directed their attention to the Top 40
We stopped at the top ten; looked how we propped sin
The case was closed when the videos were dropped in
From naked females to dirty sex in emails
It affects from retail down to the street sales- every detail
You can leave the heart unsupervised
Watch the heart ask for sin and ask the cashier to please super-size
Read Romans and peep your corners for bonus
Were gonna be wrong as long as were breathing- we need a Jonah
I serve word cause it's what the suburbs and the hood needs
Wreckin' the thought that heaven's earned by your goods deeds
I'm mad precise when it's the after-life
You bank on good deeds but you can't think this "dis-counts" like half the price
Sin is genetic it's
The reason your appetite for it is husky like that school up in Connecticut
Check the Bible for a honest diagnosis
Or just smell cause you can tell like chronic halitosis
We all sin- you know we each are prone
If only humans were affected then to each his own
But God sees it and it's reached his throne
In him there's no sin
Like there's no such thing as pizza bones
The spiritual truth- we have no spiritual loot
We're bankrupt and we have bad spiritual root
Every day we grow bad spiritual fruit
We need God to hold back that spiritual boot

Big booty hoes hop wit it
Hoochie mamas hop wit it
Let me see ya touch the ground
I don't know ya reputation
But all the niggas in the hood say it's all good
But the bitch ain't shit, so ya need to make a switch
Smackin' on ya lips with your hands on your hips
Trifle and slimy, don't try me
Playin' on the phone, you supposed to be grown
Bitch stop lyin', I ain't wit it
Keep runnin' ya mouth and I'ma stick my dick in it
Hoochie hoodrat needs ho trainin'

Tryin' ta clown in front of my friends

Sex is what I need you for

I like my bitch promiscuous
Hot in the ass and ready to fuck
Foreplay your way, all way my way
Trick a freak and I hit it on Friday
Girl you know ya look so cute
Ridin' round town in ya daisy duke
Come on over for a visit
Let a nigga ride in ya civic
'Cos I like them ghetto hoochies

Let's go!
See it's Webby
The dude who fucked your girl last Summer
And I ain't even asked for her number, bummer
And I ain't even smash with a rubber
So if your kid look like me
Don't even ask motherfucker
Huh, you could be just like Web'
With a bottle in your hand
And a blunt to the head
Adderall (check!), shit I got my meds
But I think the doctor gave me something else instead
See I'm back again
What's happenin'
Real life Billy Madison
And you know that I be rollin'
Life of a rockstar
Until I see those fucking lights on the cop car
When I hit it (Woop Woop!) we out
Time to dip, bring a chick to my parent's house
Hit it on the tempurpedic from the back, right there
'Till I hear (Chris) Mom stay the fuck downstairs!
[Chorus]
So put your hands up, and do like me
Fill your cups up, and roll that weed
Sloppy drunk in that VIP
Ever since I had a fake ID
So put your hands up, and do like me
Wash those pills down, and feel that beat
Tat your skin up, and sag those jeans
You could be just like me
See it's Webby
The dude who.. ah shit, that was last verse
I'm so high that I'm reading shit backwards
Jedi Master, life of a bachelor
Your girl's like (?) all up on this cracker
Walk around dizzy, with a cup full of whiskey
The next shot of Daq in front of me looking risky
Think about it quick, then I drink it more quickly
Cause fuck, everybody in the club getting tipsy!
From the booth to the track, I am here
At your frat with a beer, unlatching brassieres (uh)
And I'm feeling like I'll never go to sleep
With all this shit that's in my system
I'll be up for a week
So it's time to party like I do (I do)
Because it's all I know, I don't even try to (try to)
'Till I'm forty-five thinkin how the time flew (time flew)
With a cup of vodka and some ice cubes
Telling them to
[Chorus]
So put your hands up, and do like me
Fill your cups up, and roll that weed
Sloppy drunk in that VIP
Ever since I had a fake ID
So put your hands up, and do like me
Wash those pills down, and feel that beat
Tat your skin up, and sag those jeans
You could be just like me
We smoking
And we be drinking
And we be fucking
All like its nothing
That's all I know
Party, until we black out
And then we pass out
Then wake up like
Fucking let's do it again!
So everybody just
[Chorus]
So put your hands up, and do like me
Fill your cups up, and roll that weed
Sloppy drunk in that VIP
Ever since I had a fake ID
So put your hands up, and do like me
Wash those pills down, and feel that beat
Tat your skin up, and sag those jeans
You could be just like me

You have a true heart and try
keeping preacious and be alive
Say wet is not cold and dry
Seeing yet answers, not in a while
You have been saying it right in tune
You said quiet and you said it right
You have been saying it right in time
Wet`s not dry, can stop the fire
Say where you hold out your sense
So proud, never built up a fence
Saying there is always a chance
Being ready after the dance
Say why you`re so hold and fly
Breathing flowers smell after decry
Say how you could not astray
Clouds show you the right way

Sorry nigga, I don't speak much, when it's beef, niggas get touched
My young niggas shootin' shit Curry but they more like Horry in the clutch
It all started with a quarter, turned that to a Porsche now them Lamb' doors are up
Kinda hard to find a room in the crib like a fortress and them Xans catching up
Used to trap out the garage, sell packs to the stars
Was the man with the Act' and a plug for the bars

(We right here, dog) Where my dogs at?
(I'm right here, dog)
What must I go through to show you shit is real?
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob then I steal, not 'cause I want to, 'cause I have to
And don't make me show you with the Magnum
If you don't know by now, then you slippin'
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jackin', niggas flippin'
I got my man and them stay pretty like I'm a stay shitty
Cuddy, it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Hit the bitches, when I commit the crime
And when it's on, we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit' them, we'll take a cap
Bustin' off, dustin' off 'cause them softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth yo, let's off this nigga
A novice nigga never made a sound
Breathe too fuckin' hard and he gettin' bust down
Yo, yo, y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real? (Get at me, dog)
What the deal?
Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real? (Get at me, dog)
Nowadays, it ain't lookin' too good for certain niggas, I'm hurtin' niggas
What you doin' robbin' niggas, jerkin' niggas, stickin' niggas?
'Cause they deserve it, with money got murdered
They know he died slow if they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up his spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
Just take some light up, to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up
Fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
What makes you think you wasn't able to stand?
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of the hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm wastin' time
I've got a lot of dreams, but I'm not really chasin' mine
I soak it all up like you set the fire
Nowadays gettin' by, is nothing more than the occasional meal and gettin' high
I live to die, that's where I'm headed
Let your man hold somthin', now it's all about you can get it
Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real? (Get at me, dog)
One in the back wit' ya faggot-ass face down
Lucky that you breathin' but you dead from the waist down
The fuck is on your mind? Talkin' that shit that you be talkin'
And I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walkin'
But shit happens, and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wonderin' how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes, now it's surprise to the guys
And one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fuckin' with cats and order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holler at you on Baltimore shit
Know what I mean? I'm just robbin' to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin' the street
When we starve, then we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the street, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk about him not being on the 11:33 to New York
Transformin' ass niggas will get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game
To barely move me 'cause when I blow shit up
I'll have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ah, you know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas, it's like
"Protected by viper, stand back."
What's that? I thought you niggas was killas, demented
Fuck you want me with this coward?
Finish him, it's ended

Or the tone of your skin
Don't care where you are
Don't care where you been
'Cause where we gonna go
Is where we wanna be
The place where the little language is unity
And the continent is called Pangaea
And the main ideas are connected like a sphere
No propaganda, they tried to upper hand us
'Cause man I'm loving this peace
Man, man, I'm loving this peace
Man, man, I'm loving this peace
I don't need no leader
That's gonna force feed a
Concept that make me think I need to
Fear my brother and fear my sister
And shoot my neighbor
With my big missile
If I had an enemy to (enemy)
If I had an enemy to (enemy)
If I had an enemy
Then my enemy is gonna try to come and kill me
'Cause I'm his enemy

Lets break walls, so we see through
Let love and peace lead you
We could overcome the complication cause we need to
Help each other, make these changes

Trying to figure out what its all about (what its all about)
'Cause we're one in the same (one in the same)
Same joy, same pain
And I hope that you're there when I need ya
'Cause maybe we need amnesia
And I don't wanna sound like a preacher
But we need to be one
One world, one love, one passion
One tribe, one understanding
'Cause you and me can become one.

We know y'all out to drink 'til y'all throw up
We know y'all sittin' on 20's
We know y'all reppin' your hood
But how many y'all kill
Bounce that ass, load them cribs
Let me see the mobbin' niggaz that talk shit
While these muthatfuckaz be scummy
And'll go for the money
Ready to ride when they holdin' a lick
Thugs with the Chevy's, thugs with the trucks
The real gun runner never run when he bust
Henny and he mobs in the front, smoke a 'dro blunt
Sippin' with a fifty sack under the nuts
Hoes with ass and no gut
Let me see you jiggle it from side to side
Niggaz if it's static then pass me the strap
Gonna ride 'til my ride
All the hoes that'll freaky niggaz, with the 'fedi
Let's get buck up in the club
And all my soldiers, fall out, gangstas, mob up
All the homeys on the block
Anny up on the fin and let's go get us a sack
Serve too, we got a custom 'Lac, hustlin' pack
Til a nigga bust, they bustin' back
Guys that'll roll them dice and win
Girls with 'fits that show the skin
Real niggaz mind your best friend at the pen
Real hoes let your best friend know about men
'Cause I be squeezin' ass
And'll make a full glass disappear like a genie
Move to the LOX and Beanie
While them hoes backin' that thang up on my weenie
It's like no nigga in the world could see me
When I Ruff Ryde with Drag-On
Rollin' up big babies in a Mercedes
If you want herb we got bombs
Twista
(Drag-On)
Twista
(Drag-On)
Gotta kick that shit for the fine bitches and all my nugz
For the ones who smoke pot, do stick ups and ball in our hood
What do a nigga say when he say Drag-On and Twista?
(Wanna kill me?)
Gangsta, let's ride, hustla feel me
By know everybody should know, that the kid spit tight
And this kid spit fire light
And the bitch I don' fucked like last night
I don't give a fuck 'bout a 2 and a half mic
'Cause the only muthafuckin' magazine that I read
Is when I buy my gun from it
How many bullets you could digest in that one stomach?
I suggest y'all run from it
And the click-click from the Calico, I gotta go
Make it, pimp, with a lot of hoes
I'm the same muthafucka that's countin' that dough
Cookin' that coke to a pot of gold
'Cause my rainbow is every color top that crackhead cop
I don't care I gotta cap me a cop
As long as I got enough money to cop me
A drop, pop enough glocks
Drag, open up boots by watchin' co-op's in convo at condos
Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep upon me
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me
And the only on leavin' is me
And the only one bleedin' is you, tryin' to breeze with me
All the Roc is E N Y C E in the NYC with the white T
All I really do is argue
Double F, R Y D E, D R A G, to the dash O N
Catch me, smokin' potent, bet it leave y'all, niggaz soakin'
With your insides open
Twista

Twista

Hold the fuck up, slow down
Drag, Twista, listen up

This is volume 2
(Volume 2)
Nigga, so, get ignorant
Twista
(Drag-On)
Twista
(Drag-On)
Whether murder or bouncy beat, my flow be philosophical
Smokin' on tropical, achievin' all missions impossible
When I up the block at you, I'ma pop at you
If your momma cry there's nothin' I could do
Should not've fucked with Mr. Illogical
When I'm in to clubbin', clubbin', shake it, don't you break it
You booty to shapey, can't take it, wanna see you naked
I don' drunk a boo muthafucka so you know I'm lit up
Everybody get up, spin witha a Twista, it's a stick up
This where the shit pick up, let me load this clip up
Lust pour me some liquor, Flame-On and Twista
Let's see if you murdered who'll miss ya
I love the dirty South that's why I gotta dirty mouth that'll burn you out
Tell your bitch I got a dick that'll turn her out
Especially when I tell her turn around, I don' hurt her now
Shit'll come back and I think it's time to get murdered now
I'm tired of silly clowns, spittin' out weak shit, sound like my shit
You gon' make me pull a all nighter
Standin' in front of your crib with that gasoline and that lighter
Now hit, we won't miss ya, Drag-On and Twista
(Puttin' it on 'em)

No man separate what we create
Unstoppable, untouchable, motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures
Death Row at it's finest
M.O.B., thug for motherfuckin' life motherfuckin' made niggaz
We comin' after these niggaz, worldwide
Feel me, Makaveli the Don
My life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug
House full of babies cryin' from a lack of gettin' love
Ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs
Had the block sewn up, 'cause I learned to pack a gun, do you feel me?
World do ya hear me? Catch a risin' star
Fuck the love, niggaz fear me
Got these niggaz runnin' all wild from my double, I
When we ride motherfuckers is sho' to die
Boom, once I enter the room, in the air
All you hear is the whispers of doom, niggaz scared
They don't wanna see me head on..
Think of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone
Call a grave digga, fuckin' with a made nigga, M.O.B.
Gunfire gettin' sprayed quicker
Fuck 'em all let em understand my plot to get richer
Much more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga
(Can you feel me?)
A motherfuckin' made nigga
I got a plot to get richer, take my picture
A made nigga
Nigga, I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat
My role model was killin' niggaz so I know, I would never be weak
They got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins
These niggaz crossed my father den my father crossed them
'Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggaz
And my number one plan to kill a man to grab a needle and drug niggaz
Niggaz don't like us because they bitches straight love us
The President told us to leave, 'cause the government don't want us
It's Napolean, I get my pleasure out of sin
And seein' blood spill ain't shit
'Cause I seen it at the beginnin'
A made nigga
How many niggaz fall in ya vision?
Gunnin' 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison
We mash together, plus we get cash together
Blast whenever knowin' it don't last forever
It's only one way out and one way in
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups like [unverified] Rachmel Raouf [unverified]
I can't be touched 'cause of the weapons I clutch
And the niggaz that I'm under
Is just too much
We made niggaz
Picture the scenery 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine
Call me a prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen
I began the paper, stackin' at those
Who be paper snatchin', will emerge like crack in the 80's
Baby, maybe, that's if I slip
But I became official since the start of this, Edi Amin
Born July, 7th a few shed eyes
Precious but others gave me they hate, to cherish
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain
Yeah whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain
You'll forever know my name, Edi Amin
I ain't count the line, my strap, not head
There will be none of that
The young hog, K-Dog playin', Outlaw Immortal combat
With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga
Til' he still and chill, recognize the real dea
l feel, a nigga made when I was young and dumb
With a gun but it pays so I'm bustin' for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all gon' die, get yours 'cause I'ma get mine
Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public
With my mentality of war, dead bodies and silence give it to ya raw
Thug nigga to the core
The results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level
Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil
Mash shit from here to there day by day, year to year
Made niggaz on ya motherfuckin' tear, I'm a made nigga
Ha, ha, ha call me a Bad Boy killer murder motherfuckers daily
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli
Gettin' lessons from niggaz in penitentiaries
Game, when applied help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage I'll display my rage
Surround the court buildin' with the gage and spray
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced
On my knees to God, beggin' for repentance
I'm convinced, that I'm a thug
They got me fiendin' for my cash like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
Diss Kidada and I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral and tell you just who gave the order
Makaveli the Don, til' I'm gone, I maintain
My army of lunatics that stay armed
Til' the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga
Can you feel me? Come closer, ha, ha, ha
Get into the mind of a made niggaI can't be touched
My adversaries, get fucked, feel me?
Multimillionaire dreams, all I want is the cream
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream
Come and see, to see a made nigga
The Outlawz, Makaveli The Don
Hussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro, Napolean, Khadafi
Mussolini, M.O.B., I send this out to my niggaz on the streets

All my niggas on Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound
Tha Doggfather, and all his niggaz

We've got uh Tupac Shakur
Uh, Fatal, Fatal Hussein

They're with a lot of black women, what should we do sarge?
Uh, I repeat let 'em go, I repeat, let 'em go
They're made niggaz let 'em go
But, but sarge they've got guns, they've got weed
I said let 'em go
Alright, you guys can go, I'm sorry

[Intro: Random people talking]
I suffer from depression
Complete depression
Had it my whole life
I have had it so bad that uh...
I had anxiety
Been diagnosed with major depression
Lots of phobias, lots of fears
Anxiety, panic attacks
I had depression before, I didn't think that
Depression could be so bad
[Verse 1:]
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everything around me closing in, it starts to grow colder
It's like I'm sitting on death row and waitin' for conclusion
Shits real fucked up, my brains filled with much confusion
Do you know what it is to sit a 3am
With a gun pressed to your temple on your knees prayin'
Or in the bathroom, on the floor, a handfull of pills
Cause the fuckin' rent's due and you can't pay bills
Have you ever felt the cold grip of death in your heart
I'm talkin' rips right in your cavity and pulls it apart
Ten motherfuckin' seconds just from ending this shit
Flames rising from the ashes that your about to commit
Have you ever stopped your car somewhere far from everythin'
Sat a half an hour, just thinkin' of a better way
To put your soul to rest and set your mind at ease
Put the barrel in my mouth, I wanna sleep for all eternity
[Chorus:]
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
I never asked to be alive
Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive
Dear please just wipe away the tears
I'll be better off when I'm gone
In my own private Hell and left all alone
[Verse 2:]
So many reasons just to leave this fuckin' planet
Pressure gets to be so much, the way you just can't stand it
People hatin', credit problems, bitch be fuckin' your friends
A million reasons, circumstances for your soul to transend
Nobody like me, I'm a loser, parents wish I was dead
I'm overweight, can't get a date, I'll turn my walls to red
I lock the door, turn up the music, flip the T.V. screen
I leave a bloody fuckin' mess out for my moms to clean
It's to the point that I can't stand it, I can't even try to cope
And you don't know me, you can't help me, you can't offer me no hope
It's too late to try and stop it, I done lost the fuckin' war
I ain't gonna write no fuckin' letter, leave my answers on the floor
I'm a do it I swear, don't even think I'm even fuckin' lyin'
Nobody gonna remember me, nobody gonna be cryin'
All alone in my death like I was in life
Let me take my final breath, they can bury me tonight
[Chorus:]
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
I never asked to be alive
Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive
Dear please just wipe away the tears
I'll be better off when I'm gone
In my own private Hell and left all alone
[Bridge:]
You won't miss me when I'm gone
(Flames risin', flames risin')
I know you did me so wrong
(Flames risin')
[Gunshot]
[Chorus/Outro:]
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear please just wipe away the tears
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
(just wipe away, just wipe away)
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear please juse wipe away the tears
(just wipe away, just wipe away)
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear cold cruel world why am I here?
Flames risin', flames risin'
Dear please juse wipe away the tears
Flames risin', flames risin'

Whoa,ah,ah.
[Verse 1]
You can tell the world,you never was my girl.
You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone.
You can tell your friends just what a fool I've been.
And laugh and joke about me on the phone.
You can tell my arms,go back to the farm.
You can tell my feet to hit the floor.
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips.
They won't be reaching out for you no more.
[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart,my achy breaky heart.
I just don't think he'd understand.
Cause if you tell my heart,my achy breaky heart.
He might blow up and kill this man.
[Verse 2]
You can tell your ma,I moved to Arkansas.
You can tell your dog to bite my leg.
Or tell your brother Cliff,who's fist can tell my lip.
He never really liked me anyway.
Oh,tell your Aunt Louise.Tell anyone you please.
Myself already knows I'm not okay.
Oh,you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind.
It might be walking out on me today.
[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart,my achy breaky heart.
I just don't think he'd understand.
Cause if you tell my heart,my achy breaky heart.
He might blow up and kill this man.
Woo-oo-ooh!!

Don't tell my heart,my achy breaky heart.

It's a stray man, living in these veins, man
Suckin' on a piece of sugar pain, chucking chains
Take the wind out through, we never wash away the pain
So, let the stain soak, who's in the wave?
I dids fingertips, carry language computer
Ray had dad removed swimsuits with green bags
I'm on the corner with my butt up, sellin' you product
Women puttin' they're self in positions to get cut up
Up out'cha guts, fear, up for what?
Nothin' but them goodie
Osmosis, with that thang up under the pillow crush
Caught in the crossfire between Yankees and 49ers
Rivals, but the south remain calm, neutral
But we see blood that make homeboys, hate at each other's lives
Over colors and thangs, that they can bring
To the next plain, but the toots in blue, badges
Who are the biggest gangs?
In Babylon, dyin' slowly but surely
Malicious drivers with hairpin triggers
On the loose like juice
And white America couldn't stand it
LAPD plannin' incriminatin' evidence
Jurors under jag order but we talkin' outside the courtrooms
Shootin' birds at the judges
Fuck teks and go and plug us out on racial slurs
Destroyin' documents or complaints from black workers
The battles no longer physical, it's from within
You live to die and you die to live again
But you can't win for losing, what sides are you choosin'?
Decisions, decisions to make
Decisions, decisions to make
Legalize the dope and make paper
Think it's time to pull another caper
Outta my bag of tricks, these niggas ain't recognisin'
How they usin' us to get rich, niggas dyin' and shit
I putta, broke my back for the [unverified]
That's what I did when I was a kid
Always had the thought of doin' a bid
In the back of my mind, a life of crime was the last resort
I knew that goin' to court drama wasn't likely
I nicked scrimeys like a chemist
Cookin' up a pan like the witch doctor
Stroll beside 'cha like a thousand volts
Over the edge of the hope with the CIA sellin' coke
To make them bloat, float up the river Key Louie
Liquor sipper as I strategize a plan to infiltrate the crooked
New, what?, ways to live a life, who we got to fight?
Kid, it bite, are you dyin' tonight?
Relentless realism regardless, represents
South west goes out, possess the manifest that's heaven sent
What's said, is meant to the fullest extent
No nonsense because my conscience wouldn't be content
But just a little wealth, a little fame
But your mind-frame will keep you living the same
And it's a shame that niggas would settle with the ghetto
Huh, hoes have some clothes that ain't makin' what you suppose
Let your eyes close to what your contract shows
And fine print, they gotta get back every cent you spent
You content 'cause you do what everybody does
The industry that change you from the person you was
Knee-deep in the struggle, two part-time jobs to juggle
Gotta lady and A, C that you can't hardly feed
Any day your life could end, so you depend
On the reciting and the writing when you got the spare time to spend
To keep you stable, hopin' one day you'll be able
To be a commodity on somebody's record label
Got your chance, twenty thousand dollar advance and a car
And all of a sudden you a star at the bar
Ballin', callin' the waiter to bring one of they finest wines
Then you started snortin' lines, your life defines
The misconception of stayin' down
You can't be influenced by everybody you hang 'round
You should'a been more appreciative
Of the life that you were blessed to live
A hundred percent is what you got to give
'Cause ain't no tellin, yo' bullshit start smellin
And you wonder why your record ain't sellin
No more, endin' up with no dough
And no respect back in the projects
And building 23, right next door to me, heheheh
The battles no longer physical, it's from within
You live to die and you die to live again
But you can't win for losing, what sides are you choosin'?
Decisions, decisions to make
Decisions, decisions to make
Up out'cha guts, fear, up for what?
Nothin' but them goodie

[Verse 1]
If you're anything like me, you probably don't read The Source
Anymore, and miss crews like the JVC Force
Don't stop, show no shame, dance to disco
And you know the baddest DJs come from San Francisco
But be sure to tell DJ Static if you see him please
When you're in Denmark, he was robbed at the DMCs
Shouts out to Swamp and other DJs that were fronted on
And all of those that like to dig for oldies, yo, the hunt is on
I'm always down to make trades for shit with those in the know
I just found another copy of Moog Indigo
I'm on a steady look out for dope breaks, non-stop
All I had to pay was fifty cents at a pawn shop
And when it comes to being phat, the best kind of weight gain
Has to be seeing your name up on a freight train
Moving galleries of steel to show the giants
To the people all over the world, you know the science
[Hook]
Uh-huh, you know the science
Uh-huh, you know the science
Uh-huh, you know the science
Uh-huh, you know the science
You get buckwild!
[Verse 2]
I got the hip-hop holy ghost in each one of my body parts
The needle to the record, cos that's when the party starts
Hard rocking, it is hell and no way to live
All the time, I don't wanna dwell on the negative
Oh no, cos I be the self-fronted low
Professional DJ, 1200 Hobo
Crew member, nomad, down to show alliance
To those that's in it for the love, you know the science
[Hook]
Uh-huh, you know the science
Uh-huh, you know the science
Uh-huh, you know the science
You get buckwild!
[Verse 3]
Rhymes to the beats and showing no signs of going soft
Gimme a mic and I'm gonna start showing off
I hustle coast to coast and represent the Sebutones
While I write my rhymes at high noon and finetune my own style
Cos every now and then I talk shit and curse and swear
Whether I go first or last, I'm no worse for where
And I combine scratches and complicated compositions
On the radio, on records, or at competitions
High powered going left to right, and you can switch the role
33 to 45, maneuvering the pitch control
To get get my daily dose of arty rock to feel revitalized
And bless the microphone for the gods I've always idolized
I pledge allegiance to the beat box and the enthusiasts
Especially the ones that are hard to please and choosiest
I gotta keep hope alive for those who show defiance
Hip-hop, as a religion, you know the science
[Outro]
"You are not alone. This is the language of on-again, off-again: the future, and it is digital."

Pound, pound the booty
Boom, Bell Biv DeVoe
Bell Biv DeVoe
Yeah, on a booty nation, why?all
Across the nation
Honey that's 3 inch pumps so high
Radio style, yeah
She was a fly girl from the projects
With a super dope body that I had to get
So I stepped to her
(What did you say, Ron)
I said, ?Yo?, baby, you think we could spend some time together?
?Whatever?s clever,? was what she said
Then the next thing you know she was in my bed
She was doin? me, baby, and I was doin? my duty
She was a helluva cutie
(Why)
Because she had a ghetto booty
Me, Rick and Ron was coolin? at the party
Pushed up on a sexy young hottie
I said to my man, ?Yo?, watch me work?
Looked myself over quick before I started to flirt
I said, ?Yo?, sweetheart, no need for introduction
But by the way, hmm, nice butt?
Let's go chill so I can get to know you better
Her first name was Loretta, she drove up a Baretta
We got to my room, she said, ?What are you gonna do?
?Well, let me slip into something more comfortable like you?
She jumped in the sack, I had my Jim hat strapped
And then I slapped her with a taste of the bowzack
Yo, the be-I-V was on a J-O-be, most definitely gettin? the D-O-M-E
Waxin? and taxin? from 12 to 3
Oh, fellas, get yourself a girl with a ghetto booty
Said fat, luscious and round
Hey, Ron, yo?, Ron
What's up with your girl named Boom-Boom Melinda
Yo?, Mike, what's up with the super dope hooker named Melinda
Yeah, yo?, Sick what's up with the honey that named Melinda
She got a ghetto booty, I wanna hit it from the center
It?s a booty that's firm, luscious and juicy
Kinda tender like a Roni but sensitive enough to do me
The kinda booty that'll make your day
But you gotta, gotta rub it the right way
Crisp and clean wrapped in tight jeans
Makin? all the fellas up at the club scream
But yo?, it?s dope, so I?mma step to the cutie
And do what I gotta do to get that ghetto booty
This goes out to all the girls across the world
With the fat black do me baby booty backs
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
We wanna send a personal message out to all those highways
Bell Biv DeVoe be rollin? down on tour
To have all of those scrumptious booties, just chillin?
Yeah
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember
She had the kinda booty that I?d always remember

Wait...that was a false
Riot fight, riot fight
Riot fight, riot fight
Riot fight, no we don't fight on Friday night
Find a trail so that we can all feast on mighty might
Riot fight, no we don't fight on Friday night
On again, all my life, forget to take the house of white
Riot fight, riot fight, riot fight, riot fight
Riot fight, no we don't fight on Friday night
Riot fight, no we don't fight on Friday night

{dante of (mood)}
Yo, move recite chapters
Rappers write scripts for actors
Don't rap about the facts, till they attack the catch
Handcuff the shackel, stand up get tackled
The featers of your leaders heaters on their adam's apple
Keep quiet, be silent the sphere no weak vibe
We defy, a new in it root, for street wise
Got to stop it, and taxes for guns, wars and wackers
Puttin prophet's in their pockets
And lock it till I promise
{dante & main flow (of mood)}
Mf: they stoled knots, hold spots, trapped in the road block
Dt: we globetrot, we roll pop, running from old cops
Mf: the whole shots, cold plots, babylon's gold pot
Dt: loan glocks, cold shots, set off like we sold rocks
{main flow (of mood)}
We dealing with narcs and cases
Deaths over parking spaces
Evil hearts are races, or higher dark places
Brutality on mark faces, car chases
Incarceration, unite so we can spark the nation
{nine}
You got the right to remain silent and at the same time
You got the right to remain violent and aim nines
They got no love for, just slugs for you
Who want it? I fight back like a rat when he cornered
Catch me at the light, windows tinted, 35 percent
Breakin ya neck, to see who's in it
What is my intent? trying to live, without the nonsense
You dying to give
{tiye phoenix}
Yo yo, the spokesqueen, number one tiye phonenix
The black venus demalo
Dopper then tae bo, every man, woman and child know
We unified force against the shooters of diallo
And now there sure to lose like luther at the apollo
For amistad to amadou, attacked in these streets
The term cop really stands for cappin our peeps
They shot a 40 round, are brother got slaughtered down
We push thru the border now, jahad hold it born down
{brezzly brewn' (of the juggaknots)}
You wanna be a fuckin accident, the beast was barkin
You wanna know how many accidents to rob a new yorker?
And the possible attrocity,
Millimeters from the kids set the glock
With a ferocity, seemin as it's inbread
While I stated innocent, but stressing it
You sure that it was decolit,
It could of been an isolated incident
Nothing was found, no hard feelings I fight bad guys
Strutting around like keith christ huttin the site
Airtime
{talib kweli}
This goes out to mc's who used to rock in washington square park
Now guiliani got it locked after dark, so he mastered the art
Of livin the death, shadow is a, nuff of a battle
To dodge the police,
And have to rise above the trap of the barrel
My people spill blood in the streets
I'm never running from beast
Can I get a response from all the revolutionaries in this piece?
(yeah!!)
What up, 'cause of the way we think they want to incarcerate us
They think time will break us, but time won't break us
{punchline}
I rock a vest even when I take shots to the balls
The type that write the word police on a unmarked car
I resent you, gettin off easy if they suspend you
I end you, hope they use your own gun against you
It's all mental, my man died in the streets
I'm pouring out liquor, until there's nuthin to drink
That's how many cats died, slaid by the beast
That night, 5-0 held caught in the streets
*scratching by el p & mr. len of company flow*
{el-p}
Petrofied little venomist, school yard outcasts
From disfunctional world of redneck garbage
Community bitch out, seekin power over
Confiscate from miniscule shit court
And repress sexual activity style,
Need of location when standing
Spliff of the semi-retarted, or pro defensive
Spontaneous violence and compasive lying
Package dukes that has a lunchbox with a glock
And ku klux decoder ring
Who sing kumbaya to the tune of a man dying
{jah-born (of medina green)}
Y'all seen the front page? another black man slayed
By the beast hit with a rain, or 4 glocks got sprayed
Hey giuliani, was 41 shots necessary?
Now my people's got to worry, bout the cops that be killin me
Justice? all I see is just us
Gettin knocked locked and bust, without a word discussed
Nypd, should be nypig
I don't deal with the swine, don't want swine dealin with me
{what? what? }
These shot happy motherfuckers legally ready to blaze
With raised triggas and cocked back with plans to fake figgas
Who black and innocent, fuck it let's get militant
Run up in the precint, strapped with gats
With full clips loaded, aimed at there heads
Stay in the feds, double 20 plus one round to blood red
Revenge, we must return to avenge my brother, we coming
The first sister holdin the lead
{john forte}
El capitano keep my guns high
I run from new york 'cause I'm alumni
The fact I'm in it, half street, half academic
I memorize my stash number, the flash number
Ya pig stinch, plus your badge number
Ya precinct, and the irish lad you served under
I'm probaly grinding drugs, come from hittin the kitchen
A black man in a pretty car will fit the description
You gettin informed quick
You racist fuck, I was born in it
{mr. khaliyl}
I seen it happen before, and it could happen again
You on a block mine on your own and then you let by your friends
'cause they ain't down to scrap, just wanna ride in your benz
But when the cops is on the beat, that's when the party begins
Like a karate picture, the way the mop the floor with ya
All caught up in the heat, not a doctor can stitch you
Nobody movin with you, 'cause you really ain't bout it
Now there's fear in your heart, and there's blood in your mouth
It's like something we never seen before
It's almost like we dreamed it all
Live or die, either or, my blood is what they fiending for
My people's screamin for the justice we deserve
Set 41 back, we leaving 22 in the curb
*more scratching*

Wake your punk ass up
The M.C Eiht's back in the motherfuckin' house
Kickin' the straight gangster shit, for the 9,1
You know what I'm sayin', gia
Growing up in the hood, yea boy
1984, was the year my peers didn't know, what was in store
A little hard head kid came abade
Time to pay my dues, learn the tricks of the trade
And at home it's the same ass story
Mom's treatin' me like she don't even know me
But my younger brother's got much clout
I can't take this shit, so, I bones the hell out
And roll with the pack of wicked motherfuckers
No shorts are taken, we're down black brothers
A little nigga with no problems at all
Fucked up and killed my first 8-ball
Quick up the stairs, so, little sucker stop lookin'
Stagger to the house, so, I can collect my whoopin'
But watch out 'cause a little nigga's up to no good
Growin' up in the hood
Life ain't nothin but bitches and money
'Cause in the city you live and let die
Nutting but bitches and money
I got hard times and will I escape, sometimes I wonder
But, it just seems that the hood, that took me under
Police sweat my tip and keep harassin'
Trying to lock me up 'cause I keep on blastin'
Community tryin' to shut me out
But the money keeps flowin' and I got much clout
With the cluckers, the brother back street punk suckers
Try to break me out fool, you be a short motherfucker
Always strappin', eager to peal a cap
I set up a trap, put your foot to a nap
'Cause I grew up fast on the wrong side of the law
So watch me take two to your jaw
Don't enter my hood, homeboy
Not a Robocop, a robogansta, ready to destroy
I take chances 'cause life to be ain't no good
Growin' up in the hood
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost
Nothin' but bitches and money
1987, I'm back on the scene, out of jail, I'm legit
And I'm fuckin' up shit
I'm ready to peal a sucker's cap
And I heard that my hood was makin' snaps
As I precede to make my riches
Just like the neighborhood kingpin, pimp, and all these bitches
Task force tryin' to roll deep
But, I'm playin' these punk fools cheap
Niggas rolled by and try to blast, it didn't work
I seen the bullets flying and fool, I hit the dirt
Bullets fly through the window
Hits my brother, down goes my mother
As I'm rolling, I'm hitting my switches
Looking for the punk ass, sons of bitches
I found them, before I kill 'em, I said you fucked up good
Gotta handle that, growin' up in the hood
Life ain't nuttin but bitches and money
'Cause in the city you live and let die
Nothin' but bitches and money, yeah
A brother's on the run, I've got a hand in my stash box
Wanted 'cause I'm serving them the potent fat rocks
And my face is like a household name
Everybody warns their kids about the dope game
But I'm still makin' my profit
And the one time just can't stop it
So, I keep hidin' my face
No time to waste, they got me on the chase
Now, the neighborhood's on my line
'Cause some punk ass fool had drop the dime
5, O at my door, at 8 o'clock
Rush to the toilet, so, I could flush the rock
Out the backdoor, freeze, I heard a shout
Am I sure, yo, I guess I got no clout
But it's murder one, I'm the victim, damn
That ain't good, growin' up in the hood
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost
Compton is the city that I claim
City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure
Compton is the city that I claim
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost
Compton is the city that I claim
City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure
Compton is the city that I claim
City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want to play with me, wanted to show me how
No meow, 'cause its all about the bark
Let the dog loose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night, like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
'Cause why? And you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't trying to go, you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence 'cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barking up the tree for the cat
In the fog but y'all niggas see is the bat
Flapping away but I'm blind like Stevie
Niggas don't hear me, still trying to see me
Stop being greedy, you heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow on my bed
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap
And yo it's cold on this level 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb
Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it, then it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right
Let's keep it fair baby
Put me in the air, and I'll take it there baby (Yes)
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit he hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was cold
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that if taken away, you'd of missed it?
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I really say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is, eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'mma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day
Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'mma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day

Just like I told you you must learn
It's calm yet wild the style that I speak
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart
In fact you'll start to illuminate knowledge to others in a song
Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge
knowledge reigned supreme
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious
'Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us
I failed your class 'cause I ain't with your reasoning
You're tryin' make me you by seasoning
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York
It doesn't exist no way, no how
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony
African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not
and this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that
You must learn
Chorus: Just like I told you, you must learn (twice)
I believe that if you're teaching history
Filled with straight up facts no mystery
Teach the student what needs to be taught
'Cause Black and White kids both take shorts
When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture
Ignorance swoops down like a vulture
'Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor
No one told you about Benjamin Banneker
A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac
Can't you see where KRS is coming at
With Elie Whitney, Holly Selosy, Grand Bill Woods
made the walky-talky
Lewis Latterman improved on Edison
Charles Drew did a lot for medicine
Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night
Madame CJ Walker made a straightin' comb
But you won't know this is you weren't shown
The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh
'Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed
So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man
we need the 89 school system
One that caters to a Black return because
You must learn
Chorus

Get ready for the apocolypse
Because a nigga know he can't stop this
And fool had to figure, when my tongue is the trigger
Now a piece in my mouth is releasing buckshots
No escaping because perpetrators get smoothed popped
So raise the fuck up cause the Eiht is gonna hit you
With another gangsta lick
But not a rap about a bitch
Or a hoe, or a hoe with no kinda guts
Who gives a fuck what your saying so get these nuts. Geah
It's the nigga that you can not bite, no
Thick like steel, you cant kill the Compton Cyco
Here to woof a little shit about your punk ass
Get the cash, make a hundred yard fucking dash
But I aint through, gonna take your ass up
St. Ides brew as I wait for you in the cut
I guess I'm starting to see your tired of me
It's tough, nigga say Eiht is enough
Damn, watch the Eiht go very deeply
I dont think that your fucked up style could taunt thee
I'll fuck that ass, take your cash
And this nigga keeps on sticking till you just can't last
Geah, I need the money so fuck the dumb shit
And the hell with being legit, so watch out for the hit
You can't juice this, it would be useless to try this
Down your man like a can of St. Ides
And right then I start to kick
And better hope the Eiht don't get too sick
Cause if I cough, I wont stop, I'll keep bussing
I'll just pause and take a spoon of Robotusin
And take this shoe in a size ten in a half
Put it in your ass cause your making me laugh
Geah, and I deal with bustas like a duster
Nigga say Eiht is enough-ah
Mmm, one more for the fucking road
Eight seconds to get out before I explode
Boom and that spells doom for your crew G
Niggas can't fade the Eiht and the Mike T
Bitches can't fade us neither
Always learn to get burned by a heater
Mutherfuckers need to come to they senses
Fuck with the Eiht and suffer the concequences
Saps always do the mutherfucking bragging
Fools couldn't light my blunt with a dragon
And to the bitches that got no clout
Bring a shovel so the Eiht can dig you out
Geah, I'll put a hurting to you punk suckers
You can't gank me fool, unh uh fucker
Its the nigga from the free wheel prison
Compton Compton nigga, thats how I'm living
And if you fuck with that I'll call your bluff
But don't forget mutherfucker, Eiht is enough
Geah, back for the mutherfucking nine deuce
Putting my foot in your ass just a little bit
And you know I can't quit, so fade this shit. Fool

Now it's time for our wrap up
Let's give it everything we've got
Ready, begin
Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eatin' other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious fat fabulous fantastic
Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics
Gift got great global goods gone glorious
Gettin' Godly in his game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella height, historical
Hey holocaust hints hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In a instant, I'll rise in a irate state
Juiced on my jams like jheri curls jockin' joints
Justly, it's just me, writin' my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowin' I'm nice naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice Lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanished
[Incomprehensible] well would a wise word Smith
Just weaving up words weeded up, I'm a work shift
Xerox, my X-ray-diation holes extra large
X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow back, yak mouth, young ones yaws
Yesterday's lawn yards sell our yawn
Zig zag zombies, zoomin' to the zenith
Zero in zen thoughts, over zealous rhyme Zea-lots
Good, can you say it faster

This is how monster's function
Leave me alone
I ain't fuckin' with nobody
Keep fuckin' with me you gon' turn me back to Boo Boo
Have me casin' out your crib, tryna pop your fuckin' noodles
She was twenty I was twelve, man my Nana said she raped me
I jus' smiled from ear to ear, sayin' take me baby take me
Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends
Got two Three-Eighty's like the Ying Yang Twinz, ah
That's spot clickin' till the D's run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that C-B-R Hurricane
In a ill Herringbone I got 'um swingin' Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run Forrest run retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shit man, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreamin'
We jus' got in the town, we was strapped up schemin'
First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then
I popped a couple niggas, then country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it
Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nuttin' of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it poppin' when we shoppin' niggas hold down the two's
I seen niggas gettin' rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of havin' shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas gettin' hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slingin' that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am
Yeah
I was ? since we was little niggas son since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his can we were seven
He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fuckin' stash up
I had two-hundred and fifty grams stashed on the porch
I mean I'm what you call smoke man, I'm what you call snort
First the VCR went, then the T.V. went
He stole outta mommy purse, she thought it was me kid
I ain' ask her for no money son cause I was out hustlin'
She was lookin' at me sideways like I'm a thief or somethin'
That hurt me, c'mon son that wouldn't hurt you
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub
The Lord don't have imperfections baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazin'
I seen niggas gettin' rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of havin' shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas gettin' hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slingin' that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Intro: Bobby Brackins]
Made another hit for the radio station
[Hook: Mila J]
Turn it up in the hot box
Light it up in the hot box
Pour it up in the hot box
Let's fuck in the hot box
I brought my bruhs they down to ride (x2)
Yeah all my niggas down to ride
I brought my bruhs they down to ride
[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Took her to the east coast where Brooklyn at
Then we chillin on the west where Oakland at!?
Young niggas be wildin', and we smokin' that
Anywhere that we feel bro we holdin' that
Can't sit still bruh, yeah we rollin' that
Ooh wee, burn it on down for real
Poppin from the window to the wall to the ceiling
No homicides but I'm about to make a killing
Stay mobbing, is you with it?
You talk heat bruh, but we live it
Your girlfriend wanna visit
Boppa chose up when we lit it
[Hook: Mila J]
[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Roll up with the windows up
I'm still sippin' whiskey from the solo cup
She down for whatever cause she know what's up
I'm like, "Roll another one", she said "Oh yeah, yup"
Yeah, lookin' out for the rollers
Pass it to the left, I'm looking over my shoulders
Always had a chip, guess it's more so a boulder
I'm always 2 on, you don't never see me sober
Yeah, from the bay to the universe
I'll race you to a million, bet I'll do it first
Rap money stackin lots of yayper
I feel like '06, hot box the scraper, yeah
Yeee!

Past dreams, past hopes and schemes, my cru's flowin
And blowin up and that's dope to me homie I
Open your chi with the stroke of a key and you can
Scope it in threes bro it's totally sweet!!
My poetry's so many bullet bills loaded and cocked
Fannin the hammer head sharp shooter blowin my top
The grass knoll park shooter melons will pop
Bearing witness to how the Con-Glom Element rock
Gentlemen pull your mics out, walk em like a tightrope
How to stay a float I, guide em like a lighthouse
Career been getting rocky, hide inside a lifeboat
Panic abandon ship El Cap-I-tain about survival
Let me calm down, dead em on arrival
Place your hands palm down sweatin on the bible
Keep your weapons drawn, manifested all styles
Lucky lefty steppin on your leprechaun title ya bitch
What is up doe? Am I faded?
Fuck No! Sober than a motherfucker
Still on that cut throat
Similar to Aston Coming through blasting
Similies like 2 23's I'm an assassin
Big ass bullets with a big ass dick
And you can go and ask my mama she'll say "Yeah that's Nick!"
Knew a couple crips, Knew a couple bloods
But I choose to be an insane artist and not a thug
Mixin up words like some volatile chemicals
Tryna blow up like Nitrogen inside an inner tube
Minuscule minds may not comprehend
The depths of my insanity could crush a mortal man
Hear no, See no, speak to evil, I leave that to Godi
I'm the rap Don Cheeto, what the fuck?
And Ubi he could be the tony stark or you could
Be the coward ass lion with a phony heart
I keep it moving, you dead, I'm ahead a mile
It's heated In the kitchen, I'm chefin, go get a towel
Witness the Resurrection they said I've been dead awhile
And I am a nice guy compared to a pedophile
I'm playing rip van villain so put the beard away
And flowing tidal wavy while chugging another beer today
Could give a shit if the haters appear or hear to stay
And like I won't shake em and throw my fucking career away
Don't ever come at me riffing I ain't a sucker
If my blade's in your cunt then my knife is a motherfucker
Kill alert, ill alert, pen spilling still in the dojo
I curse the Polaroid if I strike a pose for the photo
Click, for sure though, it ain't a problem to pen pain
If I have a death wish If I die its a win, yay
I got the pulling these idiots try to push me
If you are what you eat, then its safe to call me a pussy (pussy)
My vocal tone fitted, I broke a bone with it
Trained for combat like a locamoti-div
Bombin on the track like it's Kosovo... get it?
Get my Zach Delarocha on, soak your soul in it
The team I play for is CES we will take organs
Illuminatti leave your body in the great forest
If he want a peace of me then he gon' wait for it
And if he close to me then he don't need to pay for it
Meter maid score it, Anita Bake chorus
See a place foreign leavin any day Dorris
Watch over my brother Imma keep em safe: warning
Bitin all up on the hook and I don't need the bait, Norman
I'm leavin break orbit, We in space soarin
Keep a cape, super hero need a break, Norris
Deviate, getting music free I hate Torrent
And if they come at us we wage war, pray for em dog...

Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing me that I was him
We like to feel the blood and fat dripping off our gums
She likes to talk directly down the barrel of her gun
Learning to perfect the ancient art of quiet rape
You've always been so warm and calculated I owe you a thanks
Eyes wide shut, I promise not to fall awake
Lick the guillotine and tell you how the gasoline tastes.
The grass is always greener on the other pesticide
solemn precious crept through the mess to shed it's infectious high
Words for me to know and you to find
Guilty, the almighty praised adrenaline,
such an underwhelming thrill.
Where there's a will there's a wake,
Burn me at the stake,
Who the hell am I trying to fool?
I'm a fool I feel so fake.
One last goodbye before I take my .45
Shoot a hole in the sky, rip it open
And climb inside.
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me (2x)
Tie me down 'till my sweet nothing's sour
I screwed up trying to squeeze 65 minutes from an hour
Outnumbered by such a large amount
No wonder why we lost the battle, the counter-culture can't count.
Welcome to my private hell
There's no one to fight now enjoy myself
I'd rather drown than ask for help
I wish I was someone else.
Mr. Perfect, Misconstrued
Lead the way, follow through
Probably hate me, I do too
You're so much like me I feel sorry for you.
But I think you're pretty, pretty sure
You will profit you will get hurt,
I eat my words they taste like dirt.
I'm only ashamed because I know what it's worth.
Find my comfort, inside blame
Shove my pride back down my face
My worst habits waking up at least once a day,
Balance barefoot on a needle heaven's just a jump away.
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me (2x)

All aboard, and jump on the Ganja Bus
We now want the new weed, beat under us
Rollin' up, roll like we thunderous
Somkin' up, Rasta not sprinkle dust
Too much ecstasy, make manna exit us
Too much fantasy, here upon next to us
Fit in ganja weed, always notorious
Sucker censor me, if you feel glorious
We have weed in our cakes and Oreo's
Believe me though, death upon your Marlboro
You want my roll, on someone you hardly know
This Marley grow, no time to move feet
Make it slow, you tellin' me no
Say you want to start the show
Like cool, Johnny Depp and you want to blow
You shot, direct; that means you are far bellow
You start to take, substances up in your nose
No nina where you find me
Some boy go rich, blow ninety
We're smokin' like a genie
The skunky and the greenie
On the ganja bus, they comin' after us
We makin' stops all over Los Angeles
On the block, where the weed that get scandalous
When we run around, police can't handle us
They wanna clout the bus, and on the top be us
They never wanna come around, just a rowdy bunch
Tengo el poder, tu no aguantas
Yo se, que el juego es dificil para usted
Despiertate, no dejes tu gente ver
Tu situacion cuando no puedes mantener
En fuerza que nosotros, ensenale
Deja tu vida sin rastros, escondete
Portate, we flyin' up tu saint tropez
And if you want we can jet through Montego bay
No nina where you find me
Some boy go rich, blow ninety
We're smokin' like a genie
The skunky and the greenie
Senn Dogg!
Cuando fumo yo no juego, pasame el fuego
Me lo fumo todo, quememe los dedos
En la mañana cuando me levanto
Antes que nada, yo quemo un pipaso
Enamorado con la yerba buena
comida cubana y las nalgas morenas
todas las nenas saben que yo tengo
las colitas, vete en mi leno
no hay nadie que me quite el vicio
marihuano por vida, oiste chico?
Mundo entero quiero que me entiende
La Cannabis es buena pa' tu mente
It's so hazardous
Take a strive with us
When it's over California, we react the bus
We fabulous, your talk don't mean jack to us
Better fear for your ass when disaster come
Pass ya' blunts, gonna have to mash it up
For you conniving mothafuckers wanna stash it up
You actin' up, we can't have that's whats up
Listen Muggs on the table gonna slash it up

Girl I don't understand, stand the reason why, why you act this way
What did I do, tell me what the problem is
I don't want to see, want to see you leave
Want to let you go, I just want to find a way to work it out
We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go
[Chorus: x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us want to be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go
Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it
I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go
[Chorus: x2]
[Bridge]
Oh girl
What happened to the love
What happen to the girl
The girl I fell in love with
I never thought I'd been the one to say goodbye
I'm sick and tried of the arguing and I don't want to do it again
Again, woo
[Chorus: x2]

Last night took a trip down to the corner store
Needed rolling papers, bag of chips, and a granola bar
Cruised the aisle for some chocolate and coconut water
When he burst in told the counter to open the drawer
Stuck the piece to his teeth as he insisted
"If you know what's good for you, I think that you should listen"
But he didn't, attendant was resistant
That's when he flipped the switch and said "I guess I'll pick off the store"
He turned around and searched the store with frantic eyes
Of course he locked on mine, I was the only one inside
Come on kid, it's time to go for a ride
Flashed his piece and me and said don't you be trying nothing
Tied and blildfolded threw me in the trunk
Stunk of gasoline and stale cigarette butts
I'm thinking "fuck man, fuck man, this is just my luck"
My stomach telling me this be my last one
Think to myself what the hell I could have done
Should have run
Yeah I bet it wasn't a loaded gun
Breathing heavily speeding up over 70
Settled on dead meat, don't even believe in heaven, B
Then 20 minutes at least, when tires screech
Oh please, police, but my hope has gone weak
Opens the trunk, "get up," he tells me
Walk a couple paces then throws me to my knees
[Hook - ZZ Ward]
I ain't even try to hurt no one
See it ain't my finger on that trigger
Visualize but I ain't got none
Now I paid my bail but it just got bigger
Sirens screaming shouldn't try to run
But it just got worse, now I just can't reverse
It's a target sitting on my back
The cops on me, yes I'll never be free
[Rocky Fresh]
Okay there's substance in my reefer raps
They getting heard across the map
I'm running shit, take a lap
Sleeping on me, take a nap
But know them dreams about me bad
Knowing I'm awake getting money that you never had
I'm doing what I want so homie I ain't never sad
Do what makes you happy even if it makes them niggas mad
And they gonna talk about you, at least you staying on their mind
Tell them to get off your dick and to get up on that grind
Trying to keep up with me, they just gonna get left behind
Homie I'm the fast forward, make you want to press rewind
I keep them on the chase, knowing that I'm in first place
I keep up with my pace, you should keep your sneakers laced
We breaking ankles, crossing over, sneakers you can find
That gold up on me, Rolly homie, saying it's my time
And don't try to fuck with my plans
Catch a bomb like you trying to take a run through Iran, damn
[Hook]
[Blu & Exile]
Damn, niggas been shot
Them pos be locking up the team and shit is hot
For your home block it's no more weed and no more rock
My pockets hurting, heard you eating, what you got
Driving in circles, make a leaner with my watch
I'll speed and fuck at the cops
I'll keep your cousin watch, I'll steal it
And my Glock's out swerving
Hawks caught us by the place where we were surfing
And brought us in cause we ain't have insurance, fuckers
[Hook]

So if you run up you'll get gunned up by this quiet nigga

Playa hation, this is the situation that I'm up against

What I done is what you do, you lived off crimes, you wasn't true
Now your spittin venom, cause word around town is that I fucked your boo
You niggaz love playa hatin, suckin dicks from state to state
Now you wanna snitch on gangstas, bitch, cause you got caught with weight
Witness to a murder, you ain't heard of, shut yo mouth when the killa's talkin
Got caught with a key, turned f-e-d and now yo ass is walkin
Rats want they cheese f-e-d's gave em' snitch degrees

Court of the law, what you done saw a ho, done cashed a check
Wanna send me in, and pen me up like I'm a fuckin pet
P-l to the a-y-e-r-h-a-t to the fuckin e
You said we're done, the family's over, you're blind and you can't see
The facts of life are that you're jealous of these Dayton fellas
No one can trail us, you're rebellious, that's what ya tell us
I peeped your game, you're poor and ain't got shit to do
You left a clue, your ho said you didn't like my crew
I played you off, then fuckin your ho, this week she bought me gators
Wearin your suits, my brother's Boots, so fuck you player haters
Chorus (4x)

Niggaz hate you got paid, they playa hatin you so
Fuck them niggaz, they gon die and nobody'll show

And y'all some playa haters
Chorus (4x)

Xxplosive
West coast shit
My nigga-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying thank you cause they tell me
My shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac
Smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
West Coast shit nigga
Overdosage imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up
Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas paid for hoes, just to lay with hoes
Relax one night, and paid to stay with hoes
Captain Save'em all day, well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches off of the grip
You punk bitch
All my real doggs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still check it for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passing nothing but dope indeed
Real trees, chronic leaves, no seeds
When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby, hit the bong
While the west coast rolls along
While we still making gangsta hits
You'll be still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl, you think you're slick
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch
I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your sixty-four, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimpin repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, fo' real, Xxplosive

Ain't too many as true as us, prestige eluded us, 'til recently
Yo son, I still be in the streets
Was raised me and taught me morals engraved in me
I treasure all those who stayed with me
Trials and tribulations, some assumed I was through
I seen smiles on niggas faces, now I'm smilin' too
At the Hawaiin view they say that I'm the truth
Life's a bitch I hope I seduce
Look in my eyes you see a childish youth
Who grew up in a drug spot, and blew my first shot on the roof
My movement's like the automatic top on a coupe
Smoothness like Allen Houston got when he shoots
I'm consumed with, the essence of the street
I'm destined to be on a level I've yet to see
Son, I had 'em so comfortable they slept on me
Like the draft did McGrady, this rap shit is crazy
Aiyyo, give me a beat box, you'll heal my soul
Watch me get down for my platinum and gold
And keep a fire arm kept most definitely rep, everyday I see sun up
So don't you sweat when the chips was down
We didn't run we stayed around
Now all y'all niggas know what's happenin' now
It's the come up, the rise of the genuine type
That'll just cut through like against suge knight
Leavin' cuts, bruises, scrapes, scratches and scars
Spent a straight decade rappin' in bars
With OC but I seldomly flow with the flock
Hear the game, make one grain grow into a crop
Like farmers, I promise this be large
Ain't they're ain't near a nigga who could disregard
The science that I drop, 'cause it's on the world
Every man, woman, child, each boy and girl
Yeah mega, you that nigga, don't even worry 'bout it
I remember we was doin' this show for uncle Ralph McDaniels with Nas
I watched you come up now it's your time to skyrocket
And flourish on these niggas shout out Queens

They call me broke goose, up on me
I'll leave you salty, clean like a bofty
So girl, yeah you boo, let me introduce you
To a new crew, not familiar, ain't what you used to
Hit Aruba, put it on youtube
Let your ex-man see your new dude
And new purse, and new shoes
Tell em I win, haha you lose
Dice game I fill up the bank
Yo ex-man can't fill up your tank
Damn that's mad triffe, talking bout the gas price
All I do is look and say damn that's a sad life
He bake beans just add rice
No soft drinks, just mad ice
Now you waiting in the cold for the bus
Girl come roll with the rush, us!
[Chorus]
No delaying, ma stop playing
I'm not playing but I'm saying
What you saying are you staying
Yeah I'm staying if you paying
Huh what you say

Oh yeah, few John Doe's

Get it here hurry up like pronto
No no, no need convo
And the raptors, Toronto
Play with me you'll get your lawn mowed
In dawn mode, that's code red
No cars girl, got to moped
Shout out to all my dope heads
They made me rich, yeah more bread
Now go head, for your head gone
Fucked one girl, my bread long

She went down, she head strong
Dude unlock them cuffs, so ma can roll with the rush, us!
[Chorus]
Yo Gina, that's Clara
Yo clara, that's Sarah

Go downtown, no prob
Getting beano's, did the whole mob

Hop in ya ride, but don't let no gimmick rapper blow ya high
Go get some screw (what type of screw fool?), Dj Screw
And other Dj's can wreck too (how many?), just a few
Where that O.G. Ron C and other boys better not get lazy
Would it be slab or Mercedes? Better go ask that naked lady
on the hood, I feel like boys ain't no where near my caliber
I'm years ahead of yall and you ain't no where near my calendar
Went from the front, to the back, now push the side
Now I'm standin' on my own 2 Chuck Taylors when I ride
Ride on yall wit pride, homie you might ask me why
It seems like real niggaz die, and fraud niggaz multiply
Is ya hearin' me? no rapper can even see as clear as me
I make my own turns there is no one else that's steerin' me
How could you think that you could handle Koopa lyrically
My flow ain't perfect yet, but no rapper come as near as me
Look what you created, now you got me aggravated
Gettin' braided, sittin' bladed, then I go hit that 280
Uhh-Uhh, 8 bumper scrapped, but I'm steady tippin' down
Ask a question for real niggaz, I bet the frauds is gon' reply

From the back to the front, front back to the side (to the side)

Fall up in the club, and I'm draped up in ice (draped up in ice)
Yellow-bone in my lap, and she shakin' them thighs (shakin' them thighs)
Wanna come home, but I'm past on the game
Niggaz waitin' in the alley, tryna jack off my chain
It's the Color Changer, ridin' on swangers
Recognize pimpin', I ain't never been no stranger
Bumpin' on screw, slowed down in my disc changer
If you wanna throw down, I got 1 up in the chamber
It's that brown-boy from that C.C.C
Them other boys cool, but they ain't me (you gotta love it)
Been true all my life, I ain't tellin' you a lie
Put ya deuce in the sky, if you 'finna get high
Alot of niggaz lame, they be sangin' they name
But I swear that they soft, and they gay in the game
I'ma come down, 84's spinners swang
Takin' butter-heads to the mall to buy me pinky rings

Let me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be 3x)
You believe in,
Verse 1:
It started of dark, mostly night,
Wouldn't dare let my darkness bring someone light,
I gladly go through it all for the purpose of a lesson,
That will hopefully turn out to be a blessing,
no second guessing,
Let me be an example of how strong this love is,
And to never put anything above his, 'cause what if,
It wasn't unconditional, then what whould we do,
If he did how we do,
We know we wouldn't supose to do the things
that we did but we did 'em,
And if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em,
But you saw it all, So we only ly to ourselfes
Help us, save us from hell,
Let me be!
Chorus:
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you,
Let me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be 2x, let me see!)
You believe in,
Verse 2:
I ask a lot of questions, 'cause I need a lot of answers,
Sometimes I think I need to ask the questions faster,
Surrounded by confusion, am I winning or losing?
Is it because the lifestyle that I'm choosing?
Ups and downs, Right from wrongs,
Goods from bads, Rob out the ghetto all the good I had,
Still I grab, opportunity and ran with it,
And a brother still can't get it, man quit it,
All lives have already been written,
there's no need for asking'
Don't mess with the fruit thats forbidden,
We know god loves us, but don't test faith,
because woulda coulda shoulda are all to late!
Chorus:
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you,
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in,
Bridge:
So many nights I felt alone,
Without a friend I want to call on,
Unlike the rain would never end,
Untill you came and found a friend,
And through my ups and my downs,
I have someone to stick around,
Your the reason I keep believing!
Chorus 2x:
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you,
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in,
I wanna be, I wanna be ur angel...

(Ha, hahaha) Hehe, word
It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
(Throw it up fool, hey nigga, haha)
Tell me how you feel homey
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crasy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentiary bound)
(Now introducin' Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin' for Precious) What?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we'll call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
To death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin' dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(Was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)
Hopin' God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man
(And his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin' a man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
That's all we got left, that's all
Now with the problems of poverty
And the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
How many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
(They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know)
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' Ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg)
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Ey QB III in this motherfucker
Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades (that's right)
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day (rest in peace)
Will I, forever be alone
Yaknahmean? I know it's hard out there, hehe
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin, funerals
Will I, forever be alone
Shit, it's like I done ran out of suits homey
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do somethin y'all
We gon' have to do somethin
Will I, forever be alone
'Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing (rest in peace)
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to M'thulu Geronimo
And to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
Will I, forever be alone (to the homey Boonie, rest in peace nigga)
All the homies that fell, all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin' heart
Will I, forever be alone
In a thug niggas heart forever (that's right)
Rest in peace nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets
We can't have peace til the niggas get a piece
Will I

Yo light one, ignite one, enjoy me like the buddha
You say I'm the joint, but you can call me hooda
Computer, wizard, the butcher of scissors
Cut me up and spark and roll me up, like a blizzard
Dwellin' your cells up, lungs start to swell up
Your pipe's gettin' crowded, yo just forget about it
Me, is potent, so bring an opponent
You could suck on it, shit I know you wanted to
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another
I'm smoked out, did I menthol cigarette?
How could you figure, or even, consider that
I'm, a weak seed, no, I'm the humble weed
Not feed to chewin' it , this spliff this tweed
Actin type of stylin', how do you spell it
Take a hit from outta New York into Phillie
Hit some Visine, so the smoke can let out
Now do you really think you can take the red out and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another
Spliff, aiyya, get on by ya
Why ya, want ta, turn off the fire
You can't get higher, when you turn me off and
Aiyyo, pussy stop coughin'
You're wastin' the lingo, soon all the sack's gone
He'll take this bounty rhyme for you to stack on
Anyway you have it, you love me like Mary Jane
Or a 40 to the head, like my brother Kenny Wayne
You need to inhale, musical paraphen'
Yes musical, Muggs fixed the trend
Ahhh, just like a head
Brain cells get lit, but I'm the joint you can't grip
Through, your finger, I'll start to sting ya
So just hear my words linger and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo Muggs, light another!
Put me in the bamboo, with just the tape deck
There go white brother, rewinds the cassette
Was it, because it's funky that ya loves it?
(Yeah man) Here's another lyric, go puff it
Don't choke off, the hype or croak off
When you blow the smoke off, hold until I get off
Or turn off the fat joint, wanna hit that joint
Here is the flat point, I rob it at gun point
I'm, the High Times, you get through my rhymes
Suck on the pipeline, sit back and recline
You gotta suck on, the fattie so come on and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
I'll just, light another
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo, light another
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Aiyyo, light another
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Can you feel the effects of the high? Can you feel it?
I feel the effects of the high, yo can you feel it?
Yo light that motherfucker up man
I know you feel it

I'm the man shorty, come put them bands on it
If I get my hands on it, I can't let go I promise
My momma know I love her, she gave a chance to me
All my fans love me, they wave their hands for me
She do a dance for me, took off her pants for me
I had to catch myself and get another glance of it
I keep it 100 if you keep it 100
Real recognize real, we might get through something
Shout out to LA, shout out to Inglewood
Up at Crenshaw 9th grade then I went to Inglewood
I love to rep my city, just hope you reppin' with me
On the block all day with the extras with me
I'm a made nigga, made something out of none
On the way, all the gangstas ask me where I'm from
I said "I don't bang, I just play sports
And I write raps, don't sell my life short"
Oh, it's just the little bitty things in life
That make it sound like a song
But why it takes so long, why it take so long
You got me saying oh
You know I love ya but tell me why you make me wait so long
Make me wait so long and why it take so long
Why it take so long, boy I'm tryna get on
In the studio til the morning, from the street lights come on
I swear it won't be long, got the top where we belong
And I had to experience life then I put it up in a song
I knew it all along, I could be your favorite
Girl I gotta keep it 100 with you, I can already picture you naked
Shouts to the people who hated
The ones that were telling me I never make it
But I never listen, it's out of my statement
And I'm bout to go down as one of the greatest
Oh, it's just the little bitty things in life
That make it sound like a song
But why it takes so long, why it take so long
You got me saying oh
You know I love ya but tell me why you make me wait so long
Make me wait so long and why it take so long

Hearts of Philly city of brotherly love was from the hood used to run the back
Woods with thugs who sold drugs her friends they used to flirt I considered
Them garbage while she was bein chased by every nigga in college used to date
Some clown from up north he used to choke her but I would never treat her like
That cause she's a smoker one of a kind honey's a dime with no seeds I ain't
Gon never let her go cause she's all I need indeed
Chorus: (She's a different kind of lady...)
She's a a dif-different kind of lady and she will never hurt you she'll never
Desert you she'll be the one to hold ya down repeat
[Benzino]:
Man there's just somethin about her (love) that I swear sometimes I can't make
It through a whole day without her some say our relationship is not that strong
They said it's just a phase won't last that long Jeff said I was wrong to fall
In love cause she was passed around I don't care she with me right now I'm so
Attracted to her vibe she got me open so wide and you can tell by the glow in
My eyes it's hard to sleep without her by my bed at night with her on my side
I'm gon be alright I love to hold her squeeze her don't let go she's my heat in
The winter when the weather is cold see anytime there's drama she gon come in a
Hurry not jealous if she see me with my main girl Mary she gon go to war with
Me hit the floor with me if I go on a caper she gon keep in the door with me I
Was smokin quick to put a nigga on blast only person that I tell where I hide
The cash she's a gangsta bitch she don't give a fuck drive-bys stick her head
Out the window push puff blow smoke out her nose it's a must a propose cause I
Love her don't give a fuck who knows she's the Bonnie to my Clyde the Tina to
My Ike her name is Nina I love her for the rest of my life

Whoop! Whoop whoop!
There's just something 'bout your
[Chorus]
Whoop whoop!
It makes me wanna whoop whoop!
I just can't help but whoop whoop!
There's just something 'bout your Whoop whoop!
Whoop whoop!
Whoop whoop got me jumpin' through hoops
'Cause a day without your love girl, I can't recoup
Send chills down my spine every time we touch
You say come here I get in gear, like poppin' the clutch
That rush like you're rollin' down a hill
You said, "Be still, I got a chill!"
I said, "Okay girl, I will!"
With the sweat accumulating in a pool in your navel
I'm rockin' your body 'cause I'm willin' and able
Truth not fable, I make the bed sing like the movies on cable
Holdin' on tight sittin' tall in the saddle
Your heels inside just like spurrin' cattle
Hearts in rhythm, nibble on my ear please be my friend
Your hair is gettin' tangled 'cause I make your body tingle
By the hair of my chinny-chin chin, gotta get your
[Chorus]
In the morning when I'm yawnin' I wake up
The sunrise in your eyes helps to heat me up
A kiss and a hug and and an "I love you"
A kiss back and a wink and "I love you too"
Two hearts, one soul walkin' on air
Livin' on love, livin' on a prayer
Lips so sweet like chocolate
I get a rush so strong I can't forget
Love is the breeze that fills my sails
I crave to breathe what you exhale
I'll cross the desert with life at its worst
All I need is your touch to quench my thirst
Think the same without saying a word
Your voice is the sweetest thing I've heard
Go on punkin' put this song on loop
I gotta tell you again baby, I gotta get your
[Chorus: x2]

(Surreal, surreal, surreal, surreal, surreal)

[Verse 1:]
Now ever since I took my wife's hand for my life span
I feel like I've been spendin more time with my mic stand and my pipe man
Things are getting heated, almost got a nice tan
Head up in the clouds, I get too high, I got no flight plan
So what's next? Should I keep speakin my mind
Keep on, readin the signs, tryin to keep wit the times
They say freedom is blind, and I can't see the future
So I got to make it work, there ain't no plan B for Luke here
I drop beats and spit bars and try to get established man
But I keep gettin barred from every bar establishment
I need to keep it focused like a camera lens
But I handle everything from music to the management
And I must be heaven sent, but I'm sittin at the bottom
I should be at a level 10, so where's my medals man
They said music will influence the people who listen to it
So I'm tryin to contribute wit what I do, so get into it
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
I know a couple emcees who think they better than me
Well if you can't beat them, sign them and put HalfLife behind them
I played the role of coach, plus the ref and the linesman
Show you what not to do, so you can put your time in
Self made man, noone helped or gave a hand (nope)
Livin month to month, I worked for months to pay the rent
So now I take the reigns, I major, I major made
Ya I talk a lot of shit, a lot of things stay the same
I still break the chains, kids stay in your lane
Learn to listen, stop dissin, burnin bridges, nothin changed
The same motha fuckas who got beef with me
Are the same motha fuckas wanting beats from me
You want ? after, from producer to weak rapper
I speed past ya, and turn pages on each chapter
You beat jacker, give it up and walk away
You make it hard for a kid to love a culture these days
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
A lot of rappers run they mouth, but they run when shit starts
Immitators wit no substance, like armpit farts
And most rappers now a days claim that pimpin's easy
But they girlfriends' look cheaper than Canadian tv
I'm a main character, of course I'll be winning kid
I never had to sell my soul like Bart Simpson did
I go no tour, I'm drinkin liquor til it's tasteless
Half in the bag, like potato sack races
Is that supposed to be the way, make a livin, get paid
Smoke weed, drink liquor everyday, I can't complain
But shit will take it's toll, I know I'll feel it when I'm old
I got direction in my life, but I don't know where to go
[Chorus]

Oh yeah I'm back on that shit
And I say right about now New York City
They say is life and death, there's no future fronting
I see a mac and a tec keeping duz coming
Coka
Joe is a fake Cartagegna
Nice with the hands better with the banger
Guns I'm no stranger
Keep an A.K when I battle probably throw a fake nigga parade. I'm known!
But who gives a fuck I don't care
Don't lead them let the welfare feed them
Niggas had me thinking that Joey is fucked up!
Skiddles with the maybachs banging rooftops
Life sucks for you maybe the Jew is crazy
In the stay pieces to death thanks to who baby
[Chorus:]
Stay cleaned up on a preacher on a Sunday morning, I got cake but I need more ice and all
I say off the streets I'm a symphony, niggas want my sympathy presiding official remedy
Stay cleaned up on a preacher on a Sunday morning
King of New york, King of New York, but we don't ever see these niggas up in New York
Can anybody tell me where is San Tropez
All these so called killers try their best to dress gay
Everybody beefing it's the same old day
All these mix-tape rappers now want to claim king
Everybody saying they are bringing New York back
But we the only niggas you pitch back the back(crack!)
You hear the echo, son of a nesto I'll let the tec blow
You should feel sky plenty like pistol, fuck a phone call I barely got a whistle
[Chorus:]
Coka, there's no one harder
Get off your knees get a job at the Carter
Throw a banks and invite your friends
You guarantee to see a couple of ends
See I've been getting money since who knows when
These other niggas just all pretend
You've been bamboozled diz duzu say thugs
Love at Madison Square they givin' group hugs
Now let me take you to the streets of darkness
Where I keep your favorite M.C. underneath my armpit the bronze kid
I'm only speaking the truth
Shit, look what these streets
May cologilua do
[Chorus:]

You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause shady said so... I'm On Fire
[Eminem]
Here we go now
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and
Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line
But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?
Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group
Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya
Killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog
How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow
Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)
[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me
You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe
Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal
[Chorus: x2]
Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -
Industry niggas [unknown] you get out of hand
I'm gone find you whereabouts [unknown]
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised [unknown]
They see me poppin' more ice because I could [unknown]
You probably forgot your way around the hood, good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song
How you want it with us and laugh [unknown] got make up on

Don't let the Jones' get you down
(Get you down)
(Don't let the Jone's get you down)
[ VERSE 1 ]
Thinkin well it's the niggaroe back with my crew
Now what you want to do
The Jones', we on this, mic
So we'll fight to the finish
But I don't need spinach for me to do this
Pride in givin niggas pop-eyes, I'm large as buddhist
Rappers want to be down, cause they think that I'm better than
They, but I'll be OK-Solo like the Letterman
Use my common sense to boom-shalaklak-boom
Then lock the room, get busy as I get busy
Sayin "Don't let the Jones' get you..."
But I'll hit you where it hurts, made you relapse in curves
When I throw verbs and nouns, any sound that I spit up
I have battle rappers usin they clappers because they don't want to get up
They all want to be like me, and so they re-write
Them wack-ass raps that they make and try to fake
So I break bones and holler "Jones' forever"
Cleverest shit around
But don't ever let us get you down
[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, everybody says, "'Mad, what are the Jones'?"
Well, let's see, it's a posse, true, and it's a crew
But not really, so what I'm gonna do
Is combine em all and find a title that'll fit
We're a group of money makers from the west that be runnin shit
Fly like a discus, don't miss this, cause it's me, and
I win fights with more mic energy than a pre-amp
They listen to Ahmad and the Jones' in here rock
And roll with soul, then want to copy like a Xerox
Cause I mic-check and never once sound like Das at all
>From a superman crew, so I do the impossible
Droppin y'all wack crews like missiles, then I whistle
Kendal'll bring the 808 until the party say, "the great
'Mad is the king of the ring," because I bring
Funk that shakes the ground
But don't ever let us get you down
(And everybody want to be like us
I think it's cause we on this mic
We're the Jones', so)
Don't let the Jones' get you down
[ VERSE 3 ]
Kick it, I'm back, never can lose, I'm the man when I want to
Might gruff on rappers get ran like Jackie Joyner
The Jones' everybody want to be us, they be jockin
Cause we rockin the boat and in control like a remote
So I pack a 38-page rap book, put your gun away
And yell 'truce!' before I have to get loose and run away
With the title I've already won, don't mean to brag
Kendal blew up like a rocket, and I get down like a sag
I nag rappers that don't follow my lead, and if they need
Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag
The Jones' for life, throw up a J if they ever say
Who's runnin this town
But don't ever let us get you down
Don't let the Jones' get you down

Please give me the strength I need to live...
Bear with me
Amen
We each walk the path that we've chosen
[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord
Lord you left me stranded
And I don't know why
Told me to live my life,
Now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly
I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still coming at me
Just missing
Sometimes I think all you doing me is just listen
I thought that I was special
That's what you told me
Hold me
Stop acting like you don't know me
What'd I do so bad that it sent you away from me
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me
(My child I'm here, as I've always been, it was you who went away,
And now are back again, what did I say?)
Follow your word, and be true
(What did you do?)
Well what I wanted to do...
(What have you seen?)
Darkness and hell at a glance
(What do you want?)
All I want is another chance
[Chorus]
(Just because you went away, my doors are not locked,
want to come back home, all you gotta do is knock)
Ya see, I left home a boy, I returned as a man
Full grown, and I'm still not able to stand
(I gave you a hand)
Well... but I was looking the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer, took me from here to over there
Back to over here,
Now they got me like where?
Do I belong?
Do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start?
(Thou shall not steal)
But, what if he stole from me?
(Thou shall not kill)
But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
(Thou shall not, take my, name in vain, no matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain)
[Chorus]
Our father, who art in heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance, at 27
No longer afraid to knock on your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen, what I need to see
Please take me, where I need to be
(What have you learned?)
It's better to tell the truth than to lie
(What have you learned?)
To love my life until I die
(What have you learned?)
Violence isn't always the key
(What have you learned?)
You can't always believe what you see
(What have you learned?)
It's better to forgive and forget
(What have you learned?)
Give as you expect to get
(What have you learned?)
That I can't go on without you
(What have you learned?)
I must of been a fool to ever doubt you
[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him

"Hey, hey, hey, this is D.D. Deda
Hello your caller ten"
"I won, I won, I won"
"Y'all shut the hell up"
"Hey, what's your name?"
"Tajuana from Brentwood, what I won?"
"Well, you just won that sixty-nine splat pack"
"For real?"
"Oh yeah, this includes first class round trip train fare
And two tickets to Ding-A-Ling Land"
"For real?"
"Where they have all kind of rides and fun, fun, fun
Such as the Totem Pole, the Back-Breaker
And the Long Stroker Roller Coaster"
"Hey"
"And guess what?"
"What?"
"They got three dollars off coupons
At Thicken Wangs, Chicken Wangs and Thangs
Thang it ain't, mayn"
"Them thangs sho' be good"

And now, the tale from the darkside...
Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas
What the flow is all about
Huh, its about this
Anywhere from forty-eight and up
Straight, you feel me?
Fifty fifty
Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight?
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me)
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't want to make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
''cause what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
that's why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme
And that's mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, that's what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit [hits the fan]
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man
Then we gon' see what'choo made of
If your shit ain't pumpin cool-Aid, what you afraid of?
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin my groove on, ''cause that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you
Niggas try their luck with you, ''cause they smell ass
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME
On this real, that's why a nigga stay writin
''cause kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door ''cause I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block
>From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wild
?Cell cagers last night from lock out just died?
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game
'Cause I'ma float off more tracks than they sixth train
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth
Motherfuckers

Against all odds, I'm still here nigga
Aiyyy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse
O.P.D. -- what??!
When this album come out, niggaz can kiss my ass
Did you think I'd fall?
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
Introducing you to my criminal crew
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground
Cause I'm gettin paid
Gets around and we down in this bitch
And the more you try to keep niggaz away from me
The more I unite with mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And it's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uhh, I'm not goin alive!

I've been to Alabama

You show me love
You got my back, yeah
You always here
No one could compare, nigga
[Incomprehensible], my nigga for life, what?
Remember when we met like a year ago?
When I was milkin' out trix like cereal
Fuck a Chon Don Nectar Imperial
Treat me right, I'll show you wifey material
Never would of thought we'd get down like this
Said you never been this happy 'til you found this bitch
At the Ritz countin' stacks like pounds was flipped
In the mornin' go shoppin', let me bounce the 6
Get a kiss on the lips when I'm around your clique
Get the feelin' one day you'll be crownin' this
You inspire me to lace all the nouns I spit
Compared to you them other cats don't amount to shit
Always kept it wet like Bangladesh
Turned me out like mesh when you spank the flesh
Got me rotten, trickin' 50 percent an' bank the rest
Your name chipped out on my tennis anklet
You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare
You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare
Ain't no nigga like the one I got, my nigga
An' that's from the heart, my nigga
'Coz you brought me from the slums to the top, my nigga
Show these bitches what you got done to my watch, my nigga
Ain't a millionaire who could take your place
Got me screamin' out your name when we shake an' bake
Got my ass kinda fat of the Jamaican plates
Who dat on the other line, nigga? Make 'em wait
Everybody told me don't fuck wit you
But despite all the rumors, I'm in love with you
Nothin's ever too little or too much for you
If you ever leave, I wouldn't know what to do
Shit, you for me, open like the bank accounts
Started screenin' calls, stopped hangin' out
Everythin' about you got me blankin' out
You keep satisfied plus Franklyned out
You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare
You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare
You think you was the first to ever make me nut
Be callin' you Daddy like you raised me up
Maybe one day we'll have a lil' baby us
Growin' up listenin' to Jay-Z stuff
'Coz what we are is a perfect combo
We done come too far to let this go
It ain't about your car or about your dough
You ain't gotta be a star to be in my show
When my man needs me, I run to it
When my man calls, I jump to it
Give up everythin' if it come to it
Got a ring on my left hand with lumps through it
You my best friend, confidante, other hand
Up in the bubble bath, makin' each other laugh
I doubt if I could ever give anotha the ass
Y'all mad 'coz this ain't what most lovers have
You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare
You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare
You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare
You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare

[Chorus]
Preacher man wanna save my soul
Don't nobody wanna save my life
People we done lost control
Let's make heaven tonite
Preacher man wanna save my soul
Don't nobody wanna save my life
People we done lost control
Let's make heaven tonite
Now as I sleep may the oxygen inflate my lungs
May my arteries and heart oscillate as one
If police come may I awake escape and run
In the morning may I have the sake to scrape the funds
And if I take the plunge
May it be said that I wasn't afraid to shake my tongue
Show the state was scum
Makin' sure that the callin' bell of fate was rung
'cause if they could the would
And probly tried to
Rape the sun
Someone said that this is just my body
Wait for the Afterpary
Where ain't no shut-off note
And every wallet there is knotty
Feet are on the asphalt
Dick in the dirt
This system take vickin' to work
Listen alert
Check out the introvert
In the corner with the rip in her skirt
Stomach pains so she grippin' her shirt
Ain't never had dinner
So she know she ain't gettin' dessert
Don't try to tell me it's her mission to hurt
I got faith in the people and they power to fight
We gon make the struggle blossom
Like a flower to light
I know that we could take power tonight
Make 'em cower from might
And get emergency clearance from the tower for flight
I ain't sittin in your pews less you helpin' me resist and refuse
Show me a list of your views
If you really love me
Help me tear this muthafucka up
Consider this my tithe for the offer cup
[Chorus]
I used to think about infinity
And how my memory is finna be
Invisibly slim in that vicinity
And though the stars are magnificent
Whisky and the midnight sky can make you feel insignificant
The revolution in this tune and verse
Is a bid for my love to touch the universe
Strugglin' over wages and funds
Let the movement get contagious and run
Through the end when it's gauges and guns
And if we win in the ages to come
We'll have a chapter where the history pages are from
They won't never know our name or face
But feel our soul in free food they taste
Feel our passion when they heat they house
When they got power on the streets
And the police don't beat 'em about
Let's make health care centers on every block
Let's give everybody homes and a garden plot
Let's give all the schools books
Ten kids a class
And give 'em truth for their pencils and pads
Retail clerk - "love ballads" where you place this song
Let's make heaven right here
Just in case they wrong

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Its ya boy Chevy P babe...
Listen
[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I remember as a kid back.. in the days
I got picked on kicked at... shit on spit at
Get gone get back (gone Smoke) get away
Havin a dark pigmentation was hard then to make friends
Felt like God didn't take his time with me
He musta made me late night tired and sleepy
Cause life wasn't easy they dogged me
Said that I was so dark the bet I could sweat coffee
And peepee sweet tea and spit oil
Say when ashy I lotion down in Armor All
Made me feel like a loser really lame
Because of my complexion nobody would include me in games
Not even tag never "it" nobody would touch me
Nope no girlfriends cause shawties thought I was ugly
Through all the jokes and laughs pokes and stabs blows and jabs
Hopin sad mopin mad before the scabs nobody told me that...
[Hook w/ 2Pac sample from "Keep Ya Head Up"]
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
(this song is to all the dark skinned)
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry t-the blacker the berry
The blacker the blacker the blacker the blacker
[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I ain't have Marvin Gaye to sing to me
And make me feel like black was the thing to be
Until Big Daddy Kane I was so glad he came
Made me feel good about bein black again cause
We was at the bottom of the market
(Al B.) made (Sure) it was a problem to be dark skinned
Until (Wesley Sniped) him
In with the darkies out with the light skinned
Now we got Tyrese Taye and Tyson
Mekhi Phife in every movie ya likin
Blade he remind me of a modern day Panther
While Batman (hides behind a mask) like a (Klansman)
We have to achieve... ('Caine's killin us)
Like it killed the second son of Adam and Eve
Ya palm is white and spread fist still black and tightly now
Slappin five was cool but rather ya ball ya fist and give me pound
'cause
[Hook]
[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Tiger Woods say he ain't black... whatever
They say Michael Jackson ain't white... whatever
And Venus and Serena done beat mo white girls
Than O.J. and Rick James put together
Now Michael Vick's the new black hero
Bet John Madden ain't see it comin
(saw a quarterback as a negro)
Jordan he can't hide it he look like an African Tribal leader
If you can lighten him then you can brighten me up
Now don't get me wrong and think I'm prejudiced
Listenin to this song.. I'm not racist
As a matter of fact shout out to Jamie Lori and Chad
My white friends from Lee County to Bladecliff
Just bein dark is it what's like bein white in the audience
At a black comedy show I
Was guaranteed to get cracked on and joked out
Now this ugly duckling is a swan I know now
[Hook]

I swiggedy-swing more action than Hawaii Five-O

I spark like a blunt's tip, somethin cavi
Makin greene like mitch, gives rap vocals dispatch
With every attempt, to have this game shook up
When dre cook up, every thug look up
Chronic got me on tilt, eyes bloodshot, heavy built
Lay a nigga out like quilt, clear to gill
I rock for rollers, from lowriders to henny toasters
Cut off dead weight to keep my formulas kosher
Accept no imitations dre losin his stack
Is slim as chances, of michael jackson gettin his black fans back
My reputation's like a tec-9
Knock out the best in a circle, three minutes wreck time
See the hand is faster than the eye can chase it
Dre, b-real, soul assassins got potential buttons activated
No illusion I have you caught up in the rapture
Executive decisions from the motherfucking puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
We're pullin strings, killin kings
Countin all pinky rings, seizin control of the whole game
I took a pull from the blunt, inhaled it
Blew the smoke from my lungs into the world of hip-hop
Civilians turn into soldiers by the millions
Assassins, we multiply, by the masses
Masters of the game (checkmate nigga!) every move you make
Through manipulation is the move I choose for you to take
You see, what I want you to see
And you turn into whatever I want you to be
Whatever it be, enemy or ally
The aftermath results in soul assassins, worldwide
From coast to coast, I got soldiers on post
Injectin you, with the high funk overdose
Dre and the hill, stayin real
All you non-believin ass niggaz, get your cap peeled
Executive order make your time shorter
Get your recorder, play it back, puff your chronic sack
Your mind body and soul have been captured
And taken captive, by the motherfuckin puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters
You are the puppet, I pull your string, I'm makin moves
I'm the master, causing you to do what you do Puppet masters

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby
I want to know you
Place no one above you
I want to love you
Baby, baby, baby
I want to be your man...
I remember the first time I came
To this park
It was one day last may
I saw you lookin' like a star...um humm...
I'll never forget the scent of, your perfume
Girl I just gotta see you again...ohh...
Too my dismay I had the chance to be with you
Girl I'll never forget, how I traveled to the moon...
Still I'm waitin' in the park
Waitin' after dark...
I've got to see you again...oohh...
[Chorus:]
So I dream a little dream of us were, holding hands
And we're takin' long walks, down in the land
My palms are sweaty and my hearts beatin' fast
'Cause you smiled and said you'd see me again...
I ain't gonna let you get away this time
That's why I waited here so long
I'm gonna make you mine
Still I'm waiting in the park
Waitin' after dark...
Waiting here to see you again...
[Chorus:]
I loved you from the moment,
That you graced your beauty
And I just can't wait darlin'
To see you again...
I want to be your..
I want to be your man...
(listen baby)
I want to be your man...
Baby... baby, baby, baby,(wanna know you)
[Chorus:]

I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and like that river I've been running ever since
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it is
It's been too hard living and I'm affraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it is
I go to the movies and I go around in town
Everybody there keeps telling me "don't hang around"
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it is
Then I go to my brother
And I say "Brother, please"
But he just winds up, knocking me
Back down on my knees

Just To Say, Why You didn't Want Me Yesterday

All Them Silly Games, I Don't Wanna Play No More

You Got It (I Like How You Flaunt it)
And I Need It (I Really, Really Want It)
Can I Get (Oh)
Your Love
Girl I'm On It (I'm Really, Really On It)

What I Gotta Do To Make You (I Just Want This)
[Chorus:]
I Want A Regular Girl

I Want A Regular Girl, When I Get Home Yeaa

Yo, yo, yo
What the fuck poppin' man
This the Drama King man
Yo who there, who dat, who there man?
(Yeah, yeah, it's 50 Cent nigga)
Muthafucka, uh, Harlem to Queens muthafuckas
(What's up man? Heh, what's up nigga?)
And I'll smack the fuckin' shit out your favorite DJ man
Y'all know what the fuck it is man
(Yeah, yeah, and, and say somethin' ya bitch-ass nigga)
Yeah, street justice muthafucka
(Yeah, go ahead, say something)
Yo, yo, check it out fifty
You handle the bitch-ass rap niggas
I'ma handle the bitch-ass DJ niggas
(Alright, alright)
We gon' bring justice to the game
(That's how we gon' put it down)
Straight muthafuckas
That's the sound of the man, cockin' that thang, that thang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang, thang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya
Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it
Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot this
Say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin' Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans
I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh, you the black hand of death
Then why your name ain't preacher
If you a pimp like kid, why them hoes don't treat ya
If you wanna ball like Kirk
Now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child
And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from
They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
Blaaat, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty
Say I'm born to rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
Face stone and the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check CNN for the, 'War Report'
See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help
Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me 'cause they couldn't beat me one-on-one
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child
And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from
I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass
I got, "God Understand Me" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, "'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck"
My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings
See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

(CyHi The Prynce)

Chillin with my homie Common can't forget my nigga John
So go and get your girls if you wanna have fun
(CyHi The Prynce)
I got backstage passes for girls with the asses
Fuck being local I make music for the masses
Pull up to the club and we holding up the traffic
Just made a couple racks I'm finna throw it up at Magic
DJ I can't hear myself, can you turn me up a tad
Yeah I'm in here with my niggas pack a killa and a bad bitch
White girls love me like I'm Brad Pitt
So tell Angelina come and jump on top of Brad dick
And you can bring your homegirls we be in our own world
We got our own section we got weed and Patron girl
We been makin' movies this is just the sequel
We bout to do the prequel we might turn this club to Regal
We ball so hard in Paris this shit should be illegal
Like a needle I get under niggas skin like mosquitos
We the G.O.O.D. music clique better known as the Beatles
And since I like you I guess I'll introduce you to my people
(Chorus)
There my brother Kanye then my cousin Big Sean
This my nigga Pusha T, Kid Cudi at the buns
Chillin with my homie Common can't forget my nigga John
So go and get your girls if you wanna have fun
Come kick the entourage (X4)
Yeah, I'm with C.K.B. and T.I.G.
And these gon' be my niggas til I D.I.E.
I'm in the club lookin' for a B.Y.T.
And if she ain't tryin' to cut I'll tell em B.Y.E.
All my niggas is hustlas, all my niggas is paid
I don't fuck wit no bustas, while I'm twistin' this sage
All my money is green, all my bitches is beige
And shawty don't get mad at us if you see a chick on this stage
Call me Nicholas Cage, I'll steal your girl in 60 seconds
Have her up here in my section, poppin' pussy getting naked
Ivy league niggas so please don't disrespect me
Cuz I still know some killas that'll leave you disconnected
Got some patnas that's in college, so we getting knowledge
Rich as hell getting that white cheese we call it cottage
Got some friends from the 'Burb got some homies from the projects
So pretty ladies let me introduce you to my posse
(Chorus)
There my brother Kanye then my cousin Big Sean
This my nigga Pusha T, Kid Cudi at the buns
Chillin with my homie Common can't forget my nigga John
So go and get your girls if you wanna have fun
Come kick the entourage (X4)
(Hit Boy's Verse)
Comin' live from the side where niggas rob to survive
Got bitches hoppin' out like hi it's a surprise
Then they dip out in the AM like 25 after 5
That's the life of my whole team we just happy to be alive
I be in London and Paris hitting bitches you cherish
You callin' her up she missin' like Ferris
And really I feel you niggas embarrassed
If you wanted her then I got Valenciaga make em go gaga
I got hits like I'm a Dodger, I just hit then duck and dodge her
I'm with Kanye, with Sean, pimpin' right after this show
I be with Common and John, simply clockin' the dough
I be with CyHI, and Pusha-T, all the hoes wanna look at me
Getting paper like the books you read, bitch ass niggas can't fuck with me
And let's not even mention bitch, you ain't talking money don't mention me
If you wanna hit you better have my fee, and that's 100 hundred like a century
I'm living life for the days they'd try to play me
Now my pockets fat and good getting OB's on the daily
(Chorus)
There my brother Kanye then my cousin Big Sean
This my nigga Pusha T, Kid Cudi at the buns
Chillin with my homie Common can't forget my nigga John
So go and get your girls if you wanna have fun
Come kick the entourage (X4)

[Chorus - 2x]
My life is sweet
You could tell by the Benz and the Beamers and the Jeeps
Big wheels, big grills make them say oooh-weee
Custom made Bentleys, t.v.s, mink seats
Make them scream wha-wha
[Curren$y]
Cars and shut it down any set, first dude in the city
To have Intevet, equipped with the Internet
Performance chip is faster than any jet
I'm down the block, and you ain't even start your engine yet
I use to hustle on the block for rent
Met P and I ain't came out of my pocket since
See all these chicks wanna get with me
Because the 6 got more appliances than Circuit City
[Chorus - 2x]
[Afficial]
Afficial we the Reebok boys, call us a classic
And rap slowly up on the block, gun and a package
I leave the country cause Paris cooler
Fall back and take a day off like Farris Bueler
Young punks I'm the ruler, you follow my lead
Slow down I been doing this, the product of speed
Can't roll but I'm a weed blower, I get my ki's lower
16-5 a few weeks, I'll have a green roller
[Afficial]
I thought I told you the flow don't stop
And it ain't No Limit on the stage if the show don't rock
You can still catch me up in them clubs
In that 2K3 Yukon sitting up on them dubs
Since they wanna know about my whip
I'ma tell em like this, I got enough keys to start a dealership
Now how they think they floss toys
When we in places, so far from home they call us the Lost Boys
[Chorus - 2x]
[Afficial]
When I go to the lot, they call me Connect Four
Cause I bought four cars on the road, with four doors
Spend another mill, put diamonds on the grill
Push a button, and my gun pop out the steering wheel
It's real, stack dough and make more
While you cats come up slow like Lamborgini doors
You might see me in a Range, you might see me in a Porsche
I get paid every month like child support
[Krazy]
Luxury, I love that bird it's easy
Lift it out, but still a Jag can't please me
But a 6, without the rims is cheesy
Like a bitch, I like my tires breezy
The spinners, on my Navi to tease me
With a sunroof open, it's kind of breezy
With a tank on my neck that just might freeze me
I'm scared of a Viper, she'd like to see that
[Master P]
You ever ate a cheeseburger, on a million dollar plate
Flew to Paris or France, just to get away
Like to party, so we buy the club
Every whip that we drive, be on 24's or dubs
The new Hummer, had it before it came out
200 and 50 G's, I put it in my mouth
Bought a mansion whodie, just to make music
Like the President got a jet and don't even use it
When it comes to ghetto balling, there is none higher
Get a supermodel for a banker, two million dollar wires
In the winter whodi, we sleep on mink coats
In the summer we on the water putting chandeliers and boats
My cousin get athlete money, and don't even ball
My son's only 12, and he could buy the mall
Call me Ghetto Bill, cause I love the cheese
I don't gangbang, my favorite color is green
[Chorus - 2x]

[Intro: Bizzy]
Yeah, one love, one love
Playalitical, is in the mother-kirrt house house house house
Bizzy Kid the Midwest Cowboy, is in the mother-kirrt house
Is in the mother-kirrt house house, the Kid Bizzy Bone
Playalitical, is in the mother-kirrt house house house house
(Yeahhhhhhhhhh)
[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And don't you wanna be lovin us because of what we do
How many people in your life you know with us is true
For the millennium what we makin, makin false come true
And until the end of days, no matter what you do
And don't you wanna be lovin us because of what we do
How many people in your life you know with us is true
For the millennium what we makin, makin false come true
And until we end up dead, no matter what you do thugs need love too
[Playalitical]
Whisper up my wistful ladies look at what this world made us
Nine 12's in the club, DJ's yokin on the faders
I promoted up my status, now we smokin on the greatest
Clownin with the paper, got a Bose, a house in Vegas
I guess I gotta say this, I got no regrets
If I could go back in time now I'd go the same steps
Look at the Lam' inside the low pro frozen, yes
I'm like ugh, really sick off when I'm gruesome, yes
We got some catchin up to do, put some ketchup on it
Been a long time if you still want it I'ma check up on it
I ain't gon' move you to the side, bein honest ain't a challenge
Only thing I'm gonna move is the commas on my balance
[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too
And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa, whoa
See thugs need love as well, but could you make my heart swell?
Get outta my mind before I tell
Britney and Alicia, even Brandy, that's my candy girl
Now let me welcome you into my little dandy world
Me and my man's at the club, he got a girl but I'm single
I got the song on and poppin, Bizzy Bone finna mingle
Tellin me I can feel the jingle as the slow jam play
And tellin me I can feel the tingle of this Tangueray
Shavelle my belle, how you doin baby? I'm ridin
Wanna hit it from the back, baby that's perfect timin
Side by side, you and I, would you watch my back?
I guess the fact of doin what we doin, see that's that
I say now come gimme dat, come gimme dat
come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what
She don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, huh
Now come gimme dat, come gimme dat
come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what
If you don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, slut
[Chorus - repeat 2X]

Nigger listen, when I spit on the riddem, I kill 'em
Raw like the Ball of Brazilians
You don't want war, 'cos the kids brilliant
Blood, I'm the heir to the throne
Not William, Akala, smart as King Arthur
Darker, harder, faster
Rasclaat, I kick the illest shit
It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist
Lyricist, I'm the best on the road
Nitro flow, oh so cold, I'ma blow yo
Keep the hoes, I only want dough homes
Nobody close, I'm alone in my own zone
No no love for the po-po
Loco when I rock mics solo
I hope that you know, where you don't go there
Want it with Bolo? Must be coco
It's William back from the dead
But I rap bout gats and I'm black instead
It's Shakespeare, reincarnated
Except I spit flows and strip hoes naked
No fakin'-test my blood bruv
Its William, back as a tug 'cuz
So real the shit I kick now
Plus I don't rite, I recite my shit now
Straight from the top, expert timin'
On top of that now, the whole things rhymin'
No more tights, now jeans saggin'
If I say so myself, I'm much more handsome
Don't ever compare me to rappers
I'm so quick-witted that I split em like fractions
My shit, I tell 'em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk, drunk
When my beats bump, bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies
I'm similar to William but a little different
I do it for kids that's illiterate, not Elizabeth
Stuck on the road, faces screwed up
Feel like the world spat 'em out and they chewed up
It's a matrix, I try and explain it
But on a real thoe still ready blaze 'em
No contradiction just face it
They so enslaved, they are worse than a agent
I grace stages, sharp as razors
Don't get cut 'cuz, keep ya distance
No artillery, tryna' be militant
Y'all dudes killin' me, think that ya killin' it
It's embarrassing watchin' you babblin'
Keep spittin' ya darts, mine is javelins
The hood Tiger Woods too milly
Number 1 for so long, it's just getting silly
Shit kinda like Bruce wit da knuckles
Like the first time ya ever saw Ali shuffle
You don't trouble, left layin' in a puddle
Bruv you are havin' a bubble
I'ma whole different kettle of fish
Thou shall not fuck with dis
My shit, I tell 'em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk, drunk
When my beats bump, bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies
To be fair, no MC close to the man
Little just come youth's jumpin' out of they pram
Everybody badman, behind a mic stand
It's not creative, one bag of hype
And if you buss a ting, where's the mash?
Move so much food? Where's the cats?
These dudes ain't real, they just rap
I don't spit what I don't know
Just the facts, no talks of rocks I ain't sold
Shots I ain't blown, so cold and I own my own
My business ridiculous, Sick with it, quick witted
Companies head to head an liquidate it
Welcome to illa state, meet ya fate mate
Talk truth but we don't play games
Move sick, look sample techno
Never pull a ting, if it ain't gonna let go
That's that, rap track, clap ya like a black gat
Back chat, crack back
I'm the nigger, that's that
The rest of these kids is irrelevant
Don't compare me to him
That's just beggin' it, I'm on my own shit
Dicks ain't spit, it's no democracy, dictatorship
So dicks hate my shit, I'm sick, raise ya spliff
I'm swift, blaze em quick, my hits, major shit
I flip phrases quick, my sick razor shit
Give thick grazes quick and chicks say he's Cris
It's not a rumor that kid Akala
No, not Ackala, beg ya pardon
Don't get it twisted
Your on the sideline like a mistress
I'm the whizz kid with the sick shit
My shit, I tell 'em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk, drunk
When my beats bump, bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no if's and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no if's and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk, drunk
When my beats bump, bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no if's and maybe's

Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no if's and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady
For lords on road and my hood ladies

No mountain, no valley
No gain or loss we know
Could keep us from Your love
No sickness, no secret
No chain is strong enough
To keep us from Your love
To keep us from Your love
How high? How wide?
No matter where I am
Healing is in Your hands
How deep? How strong?
Now by Your grace I stand
Healing is in Your hands
Our present, our future
Our past is in Your hands
We're covered by Your blood
We're covered by Your blood
How high? How wide?
No matter where I am
Healing is in Your hands
How deep? How strong?
Now by Your grace I stand
Healing is in Your hands
Sing this in faith
In all things we know that
We are more than conquerors
You keep us by Your love
Sing it out in all things
In all things we know that
We are more than conquerors
You keep us by Your love
You keep us by Your love
How high? How wide? Oh, Lord
No matter where I am
Healing is in Your hands
How deep? How deep is Your love?
How strong? How strong is Your love?
Now by Your grace I stand
Healing is in Your hands

[Chorus]
[Chamillionaire]
Welcome to the South
Try to criticize us for how we live
They gon do the same things that we just did
Betta watch your mouth
Try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get
Welcome to the south
Watch em criticize everything we did
And expect that us to never even trip
We know them grills and candy paint
So be careful what you say
Cuz we might just throw it right back in your face
Betta watch your mouth
[Verse 1]
[Chamillionaire]
Uh I cross the globe
I hit a hater
Same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say then this ain't for you
Don't worry bout it cuz you can't relate
Before you buy me then you criticize me
While you beside me
Lets get it straight
Cuz you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine
Say the south got simple rhymes
Everytime I travel I'm in the backyard that act just like mine
Same rhyme just different times
I don't think that it changed a lil
Used to show our grills and they be like ew
Nowadays they all say thats ill
I remember when the major label
Wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they had love for us but
They just blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watchin me see you plottin me
Can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh
I ain't leavin much trippin
Cuz im a man where I'm residing
Im decidin where I'm residing
Should never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence
But I'm the owner not just the client
Shit the south is where I stay at
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
[Chamillionaire]
Don't knock the swagga, don't knock the swagga
Then turn around and be a swagger jacker
You a man and you should be a man
Don't walk around without an Adam's apple
We was lookin at it from a distance
But we wasn't trippin cuz it had to happen
Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin like you been a fan of rappers
You was hatin or participatin when you saw sub anuba slidin through
You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you
You actin like somebody made ya say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and give the mic to you
And now you end up lookin like a fool
Can't holla ya, some followers
and thats the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of yall are some benchwarmers and gettin mad cuz I'm in the lead
I'm switchin speeds, don't get fatigued
Yall behind in line, yall chasin me
Yall finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like I'm the one supportin everything
Like southern rappers ain't never lame
Like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang
And the rest of em leave my ears in pain
But thats him and he sure ain't me
So don't look at us like we all the same
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
[Pimp C]
South side candy rider
Never been a socializer
Flyin high, work grinder, knock ya gal you can't find her
She was sittin on butter
Hundred thousand under her ass
I was workin the wood, circle smokin candy mashin on the gas
I can't be you, I can't do you
I just do me, if you ain't
Been where I been then you can't
Be who I be if you ain't
Seen what I see and you can't see what I see
I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free
Been a legend in the south since the year '93
Pocket full of stones, menace to society
The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys
Nigga please, you work for UPS
They say they smokin dro but all I keep smellin is stress
I roll with the best
92 million screwin the Lexus
I might not be nothin to you
But I'm the shit in that Texas
Welcome to the South (fading)

Tell me what you want, what you looking for
Our relationship is a civil war, girl.
I don't want to fight with you any more
Tell me what's wrong, cause it's been so long yeah
Should've wear my heart on my shoulder
Don't you wave the flag I'm not over you
Just another love rollercoaster
The closer I get you lock the door
She like, "I don't want to be so strong, but I think I got it"
Hard to penetrate this wall I oughta bend
I don't want to get involved so I'll keep my guard up
Open up these doors you'll get more than you wanted trust
You'll have me going crazy if I let you have the key
Will I get more of you, if I give you more of me? Ft. Knox
You know I'm your soldier forever right?
Get it, guard your heart, I will give my life, world.
I just cant get in so I'm feeling like you
don't want no wanna know what you're thinking
What's been on your mind will you show me?
You won't tell your secret it's only me
I will always fight for your glory: giving myself for loyalty
She said, "I don't want to be so strong, but I think I got it"
Hard to penetrate this wall I oughta bend
I don't want to get involved so I'll keep my guard up
Open up these doors you'll get more than you wanted trust
You'll have me going crazy if I let you have the key
Will I get more of you, if I give you more of me? Ft. Knox
Rap: Uh, All's well that ends well, soldier in the field like Denzel, You remember the titan it's been real,
Started as heaven no I'm in hell, Too much smoke can't inhale, All this chasing got wind chill. Forty below you left me out in the cold, I can't crack the code without intel.
I don't know, tell me then, fight for you, help me win.
I'm no duke: Ellington, trying to find out what key we in
Breathe again, cause I don't know when I'll breathe again
Oh my lord I feel this sinking in
I never want to be just friends
You'll have me going crazy if I let you have the key
Will I get more of you, if I give you more of me? Ft. Knox

Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
A yo we aint always been accepted like this till (Listen to the wind blow)
A nigga got dat Grammy
Open the door nigga,
Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones
You can ask my homies
I'm memba back in the days they didn't want me
Now I blew up they all on me
They smiles phony
Its hard to determine who really is rich or which of these niggas is fake
They tryna eat out of yo plate
And you cant get a break
Now how much can you take
For heavens sake
I cant wait they gone be
(Listening to the wind blow)

Sittin' back blowin' on indo
Waving wit my middle finger hangin' out the window lets roll
Get yo muthafuckin' hand out my pocket

Livin' peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace wont let is go
Say we wouldn't make it
Now we some of the greatest
Bumpin' through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Yo don't love me now
And you'll never love me again
(You cant) you cant say it
You would never

A nigga ready to rumble
When trouble nocks
Two one way tickets straight off the block
We gonna this pay
Yall niggaz jus watch
'All eyes on me'

Fuckin' hip hop clock
Gotta pass the glock
Takin' drastic shots
Till these bastards stop

In brand new drop top flyin'nigga
(Listening to wind blow)

If you get a change of foot
Inch for inch

Don't nobody wanna be left in the wind
[Layzie Bone]
Uh-oh
Niggaz that's not tryna listen to Bone
The early bird get the worm
Take the game by the throat and squeeze
Till the muthafucka broke believe
Its murda we wrote
Its dope that we serve on the curb to the booth
These niggaz don't feel it cuz we spit the truth
Aint never no fake and they got me to prove
Haters just hate and we do what we do
Let 'um talk to you in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If was Bone hurtin'
If that was the case
I'll probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga jus move and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga don't quit till I finish the race
Number one is the place
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
[Krayzie Bone]
Now we ridin by [Repeat x4]

You know baby
I know a lot of people are against you
All the ladies in the world
But you can do whatever you set your mind to do
Can't no one stop you
Believe that
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, it's your world
Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
I can't begin to feel the agony I know you feel
I'm tryin' to break you out of that mold that once was real
But you're grown up and now it's time to let go all your fears
It's time for you to go,
Its time for you to live
You've been under your parents,
But they can't live for you
You got to go and do
What's best for you
Make your decisions and live by them and sweat and bleed
You must struggle to be you
Even when you're in need
It's time, now's the place, (now's the place) do your thing, it's your world
Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
I know you expecting help but get out there on your own
Then you'll appreciate all that you have and all you own
And that no one out there can never ever take from you
Do you and all that's expected and you will break right through
This world
This crazy crazy world, (this crazy world)
This cold and harsh world, (this cold and harsh world)
This cruel and foul world
And now you're proud and all grown up and sure a woman now
Then you'll stand up
Looking ahead, feeling so proud
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, don't be scared it's your world
Don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, don't be scared it's your world
Don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
You can't be held down, (You can't be you can't be held down no you can't)
No one can stop you know
(I know the struggle's hard but you gotta keep fighting gotta keep going on)
I know you get tired of the bull
(I know you get tired of the bull you wake up everyday and it seems
Like you can't go on all you gotta do is stick in there, everything will be ok)
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, don't be scared it's your world
Don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world
It's time, now's the place, do your thing, don't be scared it's your world
Don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world

[50]
Yeah.. Ja, you ready? Drop that
Ferrari F 50 style baby (yeah, yeah)
I'ma show 'em how I do it (yeah, yeah)
G-g-g-g-g G-UNIT!
I keep hearin' niggas is happy, the D's come, niggas wit guns
When I'm out on bail, ridin' wit' some new ones
Big got hit in that passenger seat
Pac got hit in that passenger seat
Now I'm ridin' 'round in that passenger seat
Come near the whip, I'm blastin' my heat
It don't take long, for my juvenile delinquent thinkin' to sink in
The consequences mean nothin', those semi auto's is bustin'
Crack sellin', predicate villain, spit big words but I can't spell 'em
Put a shot to your melon, that'll keep you're punk ass from chillin'
Then I got that nine and a fo'-fo', that H2 is never full
Bullet proof windows and doors, gangsta how 'bout yours
Southside tatted on my back
My last gun shipment got the whole hood strapped
Now all I got is two 380's and a nine
Nigga you can knock and tell the cops but you're dyin'
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
You're thicker than water
Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water
Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water
Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip
Nigga, you bitch
Follow Me
[Tony Yayo]
I used to chill in the hood, to support the fiends
But now I'm eatin' caviar instead of pork and beans
I'm in the money green 7-45, with 7 shots in the fo' five
y'all niggas want to die?
I got a love affair, wit' violence and guns
So this is for them gangstas, rep' where you from
When I got O'd up, my heart turned colder
That's why the mac react like a king cobra
Now I'm jumpin' out of Rovers, in Gucci loafers
y'all niggas want to stun? I'll bury you cockroaches
Gimme one year, in this industry
I'll buy enough guns to declare war on a small country
[Chorus]
[Lloyd Banks]
Still walk around wit' the hammer boss
Rope and a cross
Hard times'll make a lil' nigga hate Santa Claus
Your mountains is high, holdin' in Diana Ross
I'm like a 2003 banana Porsche
I don't gotta hide sluts, to get your ties cut
They on my dick, 'cause I make groupies set off a fire truck
My team in the cutt, packin' middle things
I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings
It's 8 class karats in the border
I poke holes in plastic, to avoid a vaginal disorder
I'm a savage on your daughter
She ain't in the college dorm
Then I guess I'm squirtin' on the cabin that you bought her
I'm a heavy weed smoker, so the average is a quarter
Brown colored from shit, he established in the water
You got Banks on your jersey, you part of my fan base
Just 'cause you pour syrup on shit, don't make it pancakes
[Chorus]

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Now I'm a three hundred pound red neck rebel
I'm a God-fearing man, who's had to dance with devil
The Lord I pray my soul to take
If I should ever die before I wake
But see, right now I just wanna love and live
And show this country girl what I got to give
My whole heap and hep of country fun,
Full of four wheel drive, dirt road and shotgun
Ain't nothing better than being out in the woods
With Nic and Nappy Roots and blazin' that good good
Lord I'ma tell you we're doin' it just right
Got my Playboy bunny right by my side
This is me and my girl and ol' Sick Em Sam
In a flatbed Ford off the Copperhead Dam
Listen to Jennings sing that lonesome song
It's all just right, y'all can keep the wrong
I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time
With my feet up, lawn chair beat up
I'm on my third six pack, player can you keep up?
Got it right deep in the sticks, wanna see us?
Front yard golf field bought em, wanna tee up?
Cataracts here tell Jenny go re-up
Bulldog been every truck throw a G up
Hospital, school and the church one street up
Talk more proper when the city folks greet us
Tired of goin to jail so I learned how to chill
Me and the lil lady have a ball every Chri
Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live
Luck no love, or bucks no buck
Someone hand me a ball and a truck-boat-truck.
I've never been rich but I really don't want much,
Just a roof and some good liquor in my cup.
I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time
I got five on the wood, twenty on the keg
I been left the hood, yep I did what I said
Momma I'm good 'bout as cool as they come
We cooked a whole hog and love chicken where I'm from
I used to be the bomb, now to think I'm fresh
Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord,
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in a Ford, and we travel on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks
Now I had seen a lot of things, but nothing like this
A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime
Colt Ford and Nappy Roots so you know we gonna waste some time
I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time
Waste some time

Ride wit me, yeah yeah
Ride wit me (Def Squad)
Roll down your windows and ride wit me (uptown)
Ride wit us
Bitch ride wit us
Ride wit us
Roll up your windows and ride wit us
Lets smoke this Oakland indoe
Don't roll down the window
Start the car
We ain't going too far
You know that big 'bootied' girl you always fuckin' wit
She got a sister I really wanna get
Some Georgia girls from college park
You already fucked when we get that started off
Park in the driveway, it won't take long
Do it like that, it goes on and on
You know this the kind of shit, I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin'
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
But we got the formula to get payed now
You can't stand in the way of success
We got the same job but you make much less
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat
[Chorus]
If you feel like smokin' then ride wit us
Hop the train with no token then ride wit us
And if you don't give a fuck then ride wit us
Roll down your windows and ride wit us
And if you got five on it then ride wit us
And if you ain't fake niggas then ride wit us
And if your crew pull trigges then ride wit us
Roll up your windows and ride wit us
Ah-yo, I lick two shots that's heard all around the world
Check how a forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl
Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
As the world goes around like Passion
You get flattened in an orderly fashion
You was warned like a coming attraction
I got playa hated, felt liberated
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated
We scamper like guard dogs through the fog
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog
The sergeant general get busy chief
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith
I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch
Niggas need to stop frontin'
Bitches need to stop stuntin'
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production
[Chorus]
I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
So turn the beat up
While NARCs got me on sweep up
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this)
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this0
[Chorus]

An can't find a gal who look so lovely

Trod through the valley of the sweat and tears
And still he's searching even night and day

Good thing mi no diabetic cause the way you so sweet

And express myself so the secret reveal
Gal me love you like how Georgie love cornmeal
I would like the privilege for me and you just fi deal
Well, full dedication I'm taking for real
You and me was meant to be just like a pedal and wheel
You a the treasure everyman want to steal
Excellent qualities with cross over appeal
Take you on a trip through the West Indies
Or maybe me and you can spend some time overseas
Well, smile fi awhile then she bawl yes please
Gwan Jr. Gong go show your expertise
Well, right then and there mi observe wey mi need

Right at my finger tips is to touch and to tease
Cause mi de in a di program from mi eye deh a mi knees

She want a real Ragamuffin to hug
And to squeeze

[Chorus]
We funk, 'cause G-Funk blows my mind. (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk.)
We funk, 'cause G-Funk blows my mind. (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk.)
[C Knight]
Well, can I expand my mind
Like a rubber band? Its me, niggy Knight man.
Niggy Knight man, with the mic in hand,
Just come to G Funk your mind.
The Dove Shack is one of a kind,
So stay tuned to the platoon.
The bombs I drop to clear the room
Of wack MCs,
Because G Funk is just a substance of music that you need.
So proceed, to pop it in yo' tape deck,
And I guarantee, when you listen to the fool named C,
I'll make you say woo, like Warren to the G.
[Chorus]
[Bo Roc]
Now, can I get an amen, like the corner street preacher?
Seat yourself down, and peep the main feature.
The B-O-R-O-C is ocean;
Out of control when I'm flowin', 'cause I'm mind blowin'.
The D-O-V-E is so flossy, so toss me
The herbal on sweet, so I can rip
Verbal skills like Jah.
Why would I walk away, walk away, when I can stay?
In the G Funk, (where rhythm is life,)
Where we funk, (and life is rhythm.)
Musical melodies laid with no discrepancy.
My card is spreadin' like leprocy.
[Chorus]
[2 Scoops]
Take a snip of the funk, created for the G's.
Strictly hip-hop; no wannabes
In front of me; we leave fools deliveries
Sloppily; nothin' stoppin me
From playin' scores like monopoly.
So, can we blaze G?
It never seems to amaze me.
(All y'all fools) crazy.
If you think that you can hide from the aroma of the G Funk...
Funk for the G's, please.
These, that you couldn't touch us with a twenty foot pole.
Platinum is our goal; let eastside roll.
G is like Adam; Funk is like Eve.
The G comes first, but funk is what you need.
[Chorus]
[Bo Roc]
We come to funk the globe.
Close your eyes, and open your nose.
G Funk is what you need
To put your funky hearts at ease.
We funk, 'cause G Funk blows my mind.
You know that it's one of a kind.
Can't you see? It's the LBC,
And it sounds so funky,
So funky, so funky, so funky.
[Y'N-Vee]
We come to funk the globe.
Close your eyes, and open your nose.
G Funk is what you need
To put your funky hearts at ease.
We come to funk the globe.
Close your eyes, and open your nose.
G Funk is what you need
To put your funky hearts at ease.

(intro)
"Hey girl,you need a lift"
"Ah ha"
"I got this big black caddy outside to take you wherever you want to go"
"Oh,really"
"You want to see it?"
"Yeah"
"Oh what's that"
My big.... black.... Caddy...Caddy
My big.... black.... Caddy...Caddy
Hey girl,you want to take a little spin
Well just hop on because you can't get in
But just be carefull how you (sit down)
Or I'll make you (get down)
I'll even be your chauffeur and drive you from town to town
You ought to be glad that I let you cum
The only kind of gas I ever use is premium
As we were driving to our destination on a quest
She said,"May I relax on your big head rest?"
Now we listened to her favorite song,relaxed and laid back
As I brove,her to Jersey on my big black Cadillac
My big.... black.... Caddy....Caddy
My big.....black.... Caddy....Caddy
Now when I'm drivin' down deep dark tunnels on slick wet roads
That's when I put my black Caddy in cruise control
You fella's Caddy's on the side of the road,then go tow it
Because my horn is workin' fine,don't believe me
Come blow it
Not Mercedes,BMW,Porsche or Masarati,it's a big fat stretch
I'm tellin' everybody (my big black Caddy)
Yo,I know ain't nothing wrong with your hearin'
And I got a strong back that provides the power steering
The fellas all (jealous) The ladies all (want it)
You can't get in it but you all can ride on it
My big.... black.... Caddy...Caddy
My big.....black I drives a Caddy....Caddy
A huh,huh,well,it's not the kind of Caddy that runs on gas
It's the kind of Caddy that runs on (ass)
The ladies waitin' in line to keep polished and shined
It's designed so they never make one like mine
It's rammed through many towns
Really got around (did work,done damage)
And it never broke down
My Cadillac is great,earth's 8th wonder of the world
Take it out my garage and scare the (shit out of girls)
It's big,you dig,but there no need to panic
'Cause the Caddy's fully loaded and it's aerodynamic
My big.... black.... Caddy...Caddy
My big.....black I drives a Caddy....Caddy
Joy-riding with my Caddy,cold chillin',gettin' loose
When I saw this flygirl who needed a boost
So I dipped into her bumpers with skill and with class
She screamed."Harder,won't you give me just a little more gas"
Doin' my best so she wouldn't feel inferior
She said "I like your nice plush vinyl exterior"
She was holdin' on tighter than a figure-four leg lock
This is what she said the first time she saw the jock
(Who Johnny Carson,your Caddy's so large)
(But you can park your Cadillac in my greasy garage)
My big.....black.....Caddy...Caddy
My big.....black I drives a Caddy....Caddy

We da, we da
Da best
Sping of ours
Yo! Most hated, incorporated with wealth
Underrated, I felt had to operate it with help
Separated myself in these decorated to bail
Got educated and dealt with places safe than the melt
God gift as a kid, blockin' up all previous
Like who's not scared of chain too on that park bench
Watch keep shit and shapon sick
You stick to conscience, hit the corner, take over Walkman's
Like G money and that Wrangler
Showin' this new drug that I had, niggas it's danger
Spittin' Basquiat, I'm a painter
Every hard verse, great off work, you can hang up
No need to read the book when the author's here
Everywhere I look feds parkin here
Empty out the clip in yo partner's beard
Why'd he get a shave? Anesthesia and the partners chill
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
All my niggas can wait 'cause soon all my niggas be straight
And all my niggas will wait then what? All my niggas is safe
Banana clips with the K so that all my niggas be safe
The quick to pitch every day, you don't know my niggas be late
Wait, Frank Noola when I'm last tappin er
Dom's all up in his face like the smack ballad
Was in the lake but move water like the back paddle
They try to name the place so all deserve to mack at you
B4 the C4
Was drug trafficking, traveling, make em detour
Payin' preachers, coliseum, listen we need more
Grantin' wishes, drippin' 6's, preachers off D4
We da best, I don't see the rest
And I'm a be the best so I don't need the rest
Need a short stopper, not without a G to catch
My niggas drove high faster than a G a pack
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)
I be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)
Getting high, UFO in the black ghost
Yo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)
See me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)

Yo, who want it with us? Y'all niggas not fuckin' wit' us
Y'all hoppin' nimrods; We holdin' on up under the truck
We caked out; we all got cars so when we wake up in the mornin'
We race out; but first blow the place out
It gets outrageous; to all my thug niggas, throw your sets up
And spit y'all razors
I hop in to spin out; I'm the opposite of H2O
So in the year two thousand, the lights would a never went out
Plus I rock ice, it drips on my boot; I shake it off
'Cause I'm fire, so every few seconds I take it off
I'm lightweight; I let y'all throw them dumbbells
I just throw back them dumb dumb shells to make y'all run well
I shoot dummies, blast backs
Money gassed up while I'm a open this tank
Yo, pass me the shank
I blackout, swipe 'em like a credit card till I max out
And that's just to let y'all know that Drag is back now
[Chorus: x2]
Now all my motherfuckin' peoples say yeah, yeah
Now all my motherfuckin' thugs say yeah, yeah
Now all my motherfuckin' ladies say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, throw your hands in the air, c'mon
Y'all keep pushin' that whack shit out there; y'all unable
Drag's like jumper cables, negative and a positive
Y'all ain't gon' feel shit till y'all get a lot of this
I don't care about y'all hatin' niggas; my moms is part of this
She looks at herself and says I got all this
'Cause I drop them hits that make y'all chumps don't drop shit
Drag straps up when he get up in his women
Put somethin' long in the booty have 'em switchin' different
I snatch niggas wife to show 'em the light
Give 'em dick, then I'm hittin' the switch
And while she snorin', she don't know I'm gone by the mornin'
Back to the corner till that blue van come up; my hands is cuffed, uh
Whose fingers stay numb from rollin' up
Who finger fucks chicks till they throwin' up
Whose fingerprints cops keep showin' up
'Cause who that kid always ride and is throwin' truck
[Chorus x 2]
Yo, yo, I just take a strong pull and strike the match on niggas
I spit lit candles and drop hot wax on niggas
My middle name Jason
That means I'm capable of throwin' a mass on and axe niggas
Y'all better ask niggas
First name: Mel
I mean that's what them checks say
When they come in the mail, make bank tellers cum on they self
Count it fast, ma; we all professionals here
How's it feel knowin' I'm walkin' outta here
With what you get in a year?
I'm rude to a bitch, but y'all niggas get out the street
Act like you don't see this black jeep, and get some flat feet
Y'all rock gators; we straight problems
We rock our Timbs half O's, laces like our dogs got 'em
Fuck it, for two minutes, let 'em play wit' a new pair
I got enough spares to flood the block with footwear
Pockets like a blimp; shit, it's been a good year
Where my Ruff Ryders?
We still in here
[Chorus x 4]

Oh! It's music to my ears, Oh man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin great man! Okay, let me see
How could I begin
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was red wine, more red wine, and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us, why did we have to break up
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really ask for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk
Weisman Gale, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin, I want to bag ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rappin pump
Zappin Eric Clapton, (Shaft?), Frank Zappa crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula thatcha want
I mean I really want you bad you cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupunc-ture
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad-
You can be a permanent fixture
In my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whit trixter
My sig-nature sound, when the tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put on in an instant, wow
Man what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma
Ceuticals, it's beautiful, pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I'll cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword boy, I'm like a fucken Red Sonia
Get it stuck in your cornea
Nice knowin ya Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin
Drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck ya doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucken on
What the fuck are you doin'
You're runnin' over the snow blower
With the lawnmower, blow on your
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad-
In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molesting you
Tittyfucking you til your breasticle
Flesh, tickles my testicles
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend
You need some ointment, just make an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins wit
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle, new thread from the sewing kit
An attempt to seperate em and stitch em back at the loin shit
Lured the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip
Cookie, lookie even took me a polaroid, bitch
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my

Hey, yo, The sky swallowed the sun

Puttin' out shiners that gave the cause
ArmorAll-ed down, the downtown activity
I'm bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh, but lets stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been breifed:
NO BEEF, JUST PARTY!
Of course your gonna have some clown niggaz try to
take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but its known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down!
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
Cause the floor's filled with action and we don't need
any distractions tonight ya'll.

introduce me to your madaam ?Mauzel?
I'm Tarzan and she's my gazelle

Treat your troubles like colds
Sweat it out, get it out
So we can get in the right mode
Let it out
No need to pull on the throttle
If I could bottle this love I wouldn't hesitate
Get it straight
Wonder why I can medicate the soul

And this must be the right run ya'll

As I buck, you will die, I bounce the scene and without a trace
If it's Anna to handle, the Misses Gangsta is 'bout her biz
I be coming and gunnin', I thought you hoes knew what time it is
When you see me you know that it's some shit, 'cuz I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
I be taking them chances, 'cuz I'm a gangsta that's claiming clout
If you bitches keep pressing off in my grill, I'm a choke you out
This is how I represent for my ghetto-gangsta niggas
If you want a gangsta girl, holla at a lady boy

Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking, when we're tossing it up
Listen baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on
I like the way you please me, babe
The sexy way you tease me, yeah (That's right)
The way you move your body

So won't play on oh yeah!
How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day, arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play
Check your sexuality as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Looking for suckers 'cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming "Compton", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up
Let me see you toss it up (Toss it up)
Won't you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Toss it up now ye ye
Toss it up now ye ye
Toss it up now

I guess I'll start by saying the bitch aint worth a penny
And when it comes to fucking, geah, she fucks plenty
Known around the hood cause she's got much clout
In a circle to the homies like a damn bus route
Geah, in the back seat somebody's finger fucking
Just like a chicken on my dick she's plucking
Oh geah, a chicken head bitch is what you call her
Fucking everybody from clucks to ballers
I know you seen her coming from the 10 dollar motel
2 Hours is what you get to make this bitch yell
Holler and scream, climb the walls
Open your mouth bitch here comes the balls
And don't fake hoe, because I'm ready to rock ya
Killing that twat off just like my man Shocker
Hoe is hotter than salsa, but leave that
Drama nigga you can toss her, cause she's a hoodrat
She's sneakier than a fucking devil
Just like Bushwick said, geah she's on the other level
Some St. Ides brew and the bud you can work this
Turning tricks like a clown in a circus
And don't get sprung, your little dick
24 7 Everybody sticks, geah
Thats the way it is, thats how it goes
Sucking up nuts like water from a garden hose
So boys strap the jimme when its hard
Cause the juices might be charged
And geah, she got the shit that kills
And you'll be pulling out an electric eel
Fucking everyday, just to get her propers
You might get hooked but she wont stop the
Sucking and fucking and geah its just like that
Dirty as hell, damn, another hoodrat
Now the shit done hit the fan because the bitch is plump
And she don't know cause she was fucking like 20 chumps
And thats a damn shame. Dont know his last name
Might come out Freddy Krueger cause they all ran a fucking train
But, fuck no, she's not a tease
Even when she's pregnant the rat likes to skeez
So here's the dick hit it please
Nibble on my stick like cheese
After fucking everyone, look at what the hoe done
Got dick whipped and now the bitch is sprung
But a little game and you'll still get the tramp
Giving up her county checks and the food stamps
So watch out your shit if you hear the claps
Cause the claps is so horny for the traps
So I guess if that bitch is a hoodrat
She won't get Eiht by his mutherfucking hood cat, geah

"3rd place is everything
C'mon, I'll show you"
Tight fit, dim lit spot, is where I'm movin to
Sweaty but these slow tracks start soothin you
Light-skinned, steps into the picture
Program is fixed, the mix will let you get your
Hand around waist, space drippin from moisture
Strokin the neck, you suspect that she'll voice her
Approval, whippin and flippin your pelvis
Brothers step in, step off, you get selfish
Yours for the take-home, so she can take up space
At your place, but then you start to wake up
Groove goes to fade, introductions are made
Love my name is Serch, now step for some shade
In the dancehall
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
Soulfully smooth, she slithered to a solo
Spot to drop her bass and I'll follow
Fiend on a focus, I spoke this figure of speech
Supposed to sway those who seek
Such wisdom, wildly workin towards a woman
Therefore she's drawn, to the other man's
Intentions of a G, tryin to stump me
Announced presence in the house of Mr. Puffy
Smoke filled the tight-packed system
A rack of skirt, kit for a victim
A three-stage pleasure on a principle
As I step and drop a syllable (yyyyo!)
A syllabus spoken by the 3rd on sss-swooin
A female, to impale, push-up, smooth and
Turn to spurn desire, that all?
Another episode in the dancehall
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
Step to the A.M., playin a song that's slow
Low tempo kicks lyrics to those who show
A need to step to a def 3rd Bassment
A wink of eye, the smile of a face and I'm
D-O-W-N to send shockwaves
Up the spine, while the clock saves
Just enough ticks to lick neck to your lips
Mouth to mouth, palm upon hips
Sigh in pleasure, measures the heat up
Nibble my neck, the affection I eat up
Dine like a diner, hot enough to simmer
Jam comes to a close, come give a
Number of seven in regard to the residents
Told the mob that I slobbed and showed evidence
Lipstick on the quill, a digit to call
Another lovestruck, stuck to the wall
Of the dancehall
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
Steppin over heads that swayed
You move over and the record's played
Swayed over smoothly, soothin a listener
Undergoes wanted death of a dancer
To twist over you rises your liquor
Slight panic on a dancehall picture
Motion flows, scene gets hectic
Freakin bones like an epileptic
Melody moves scenario to chaos
Pursue principles and then you shoot livest
So-called, it's boots that rise and fall
Steppin to the A.M., in the dancehall
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"
"3rd place is everything"

Well, Debbie thinks this is all about her biological clock
And I...
She stopped screaming long enough to tell you that?
Huh? No no no no, no, the other Debbie
Debbie the teacher?
Oh, you mean... Black Debbie
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, why is she "Black" Debbie?
No, not in a bad way
It's just to tell them apart because she's... black!
True, Doom rolled on through with a whole crew
That stole on you for holding old brew, who told you?
Even if it's crap, mind your own business
They raps ain't got no gift like a lonely Christmas
Real phony with beats that's hardly fresh
How they manage to deal is anybody's guess
Yours is as good as mine, she's sure fine
From the hood where you squeeze your nine off the free cheese line
All you saw was a do a bee's line
To where she stood and sipped the Nehi Grape, the sweet kind
Circle you, thicker by de-sign
Be-hind swingin like bring it back, come rewind
Uhh, excuse me boo
She stuck out her tongue, it was purple number two
FDA approved played it smoother than a doo rag
What a brother gotta do to get a taste a some of you?
Bagged, and he don't mean coach
Then she saw the mask, acted like she seen a roach
The mirror shine reflect colors like your CD's
Show love to others, we all brothers like the Bee Gees
All except the broads and you
Hold your applause, they break God's laws and who pays?
The taxpayer that's who
Catch a rapper by his toe and smack off his tattoos
That's gonna leave a bruise
Leave 'em grievin blues like believin in evening news
They must be eatin glue
Heave it all back, and we even Steven Sue
Sprinkle lyrics like seasoning beef stew
And sneezin all in it after breathin in the flu
Get a clue, his reasoning is askew
As to all the feverin and heavin up goo
Either that or... dude
Leave your girl around this man whore and she's too screwed
Just in case she's in a "what you wanna do" mood
Bring your plate to the Metal Face and get your food chewed
? tastes like chicken
He wastes no time like the bassline kickin in
Or like a lace eye with you through thick and thin
Raw humor, face pie to a frickin chin
New York'n, a hell of a finer town
Choose your words wisely from the Boogie Down to Chinatown
Or be found with a hole in your designer gown
In the role of public opinion it earned a minor frown
If you think you're slick, you might could wish, but uhh
As a few good men set sights to link with your chick
You have to find a new hen fight to drink your liq'
Ten years later, see how Enzyte'll shrink your... wallet
As you wallow in a sorrow pit
Cheers, is that your beer kid? Then swallow it
Or get chased by the Sandman, on some Apollo
Flow so weird, his own peers couldn't follow it
On the phone, he sounded like a real paid
Then we met in person, he was three shades blacker
That's why he saved money over ball and chain dames
We all the same, no callin names
I'm as smart as him!
What? I got Ph.D's in four scientific disciplines
Really?
Why do you think they call me Dr. Quinn?
Um, I just thought that was a nickname
You know, like Dr. Dre
East-side!

Right, right, woy, bring it, woy
BDP, woy, BDP, woy, BDP, woy, woy
Now smooth it out, woy, woy, woy, woy
Original, original
Alright, here we go, woy, woy
Hi, hello, whassup, and whats happenin'?

Some need slappin', 'cause what theyre sayin'
Is wack and weak and wait, let me speak, woy
Dont be the sucker comin' into my face with that, woy
Yang yang, or youll be down with the chain gang, woy
Draggin' your feet, to a beat produced by BDP, woy
One of the many, from the library, woy
I teach hip hop for a living
So heres a smidgen, of what Im givin'
KRS-One two three four, encore
Im not a freshman, sophomore, and further more, woy
I graduated from the school of no shorts
To the world of rappin' I brought
Thats it, thats all, single, no more, no less
That style was created by DJ KRS, woy
Offbeat got you out your seat, woy
When I created the style, they studied every single week, woy
Now you come in my face like youre rulin'? Woy
But Im teacher boy, who you foolin'
See theres no defense against common sense
Confidence, intelligence or excellence
Intense, but heres the difference
KRS-One does not mean ignorance
Try obediance, magnificence
As a reference, stop the violence
Criminal minded, poetry, and jimmy hats
Is that your title? Gimme dat, woy
Woy, woy, woy
Now lets take it back a little bit, woy, woy
Spit Fire, home again
Woy, woy
You cant test BDP boy, woy
So bust this down, woy, woy
While I got your attention I feel like just
Lettin' off two or three lyric then steppin'
Jettin', gettin' the respect of a teacher
My name is Kris, twenty three, glad to meet ya
BDP is the number one set
I dont drop science, I teach it, correct
Some get caught in my style like a net
They cant get out, so I treat 'em like a pet
Sit boy, down boy, dont bite me yet
I bet youre kind of hungry, heres a calcan, step
'Cause Ive got no time to hold your hand
I just slam, so you can understand who I am, woy
The teacher, professor, scholar makin' dollars, woy
The trainer, entertainer, makin' ya holla, woy
The numero uno, number one, the best perfectionist, woy
Crazy, woy, fresh KRS, woy
So gimme dat
Woy, woy, woy
Now take it on back, woy, woy
Original, original, original, hit it
Woy, woy, woy
Original, ah, one, two, three, we out, woy, woy

One day I was chillin' on Araabie and spruce
Forty in my hand and it's time to get loose
Got my Nikes, Fila t-shirt, and black khakis
I heard a horn blowin' and I jumped in my jacket
John was chillin' in the passenger seat
Stepped up out the car and started dancing in the street
Now John was lookin' fresh and it wasn't no joke
He had on some fresh khakis and was sportin' some Locs
Some gangstas poppin' wheelies came up from behind
He got off throwin' up his favorite gang sign
Here come Little Snub, from the Maple block
Groovin' on the handlebars, ready to rock
And now my posse's gettin' bigger, 'cause of all these niggas
I got the .38 and I'm about to pull the trigger
Looked up at the corner and who did I see?
Wayne and his little man Pop and Nookie
Now Sha came rollin' up on a little scooter
Lookin' for a match so he could light the Thai huddha
I told him I didn't have it, but yet I went to grab it
I lit it up and hit it up, and now I'm draggin' it
Wayne took a hit, Pop took a puff
Nookie started chokin' and now he's fucked up
The forty-ounce is hittin', so I busted into school
I'm never gettin' sweated 'cause I'm just too cool fool
Sun's goin' down and now it's night
My posse's cold chillin' and we're feelin' alright
We heard a lot of noise and it sounded like a rally
Boomin' ass sounds comin' out of Sherm Alley
We all jumped up and we started to stroll
A young nigga like the Quiksta was takin' control
The D.E.A. posse so deep we walked three twos
Now if you want to join then you gotta pay ya dues
We got up to the alley and everything was chill
They was just makin' that dollar dollar bill
Reesa came down and she sat on the stairs
I stood up 'cause I didn't have a chair
Now Pop said, "Yo! Let's get some cuts
Get that Old 8 so we can get fucked up"
Now I'll put a twenty H put a 10
And said, "Fuck it! Super soca and gin"
Now everybody's gettin' in the twilight zone
Head up stairs and they're gettin' weirdo
Gangsta's on the steps and he's tryin' to bang
No belt in his khakis so his Lee's could sag
Here comes Stick with a twenty dollar bag
But he can't roll a joint 'cause he ain't got no zigzags
I looked up at my watch, it said 10:28
You better run up to the liquor store before it's too late
He went to the store and he got the zags
He came back walkin' with my homeboy Cash
Sucka came over he was lookin' for a ride
Runnin' from the police, he ain't have no place to hide
A smile came on my face when I swallowed my beer
I'm chillin' like a villain and I got no fear
Now Tony Lane came he said he was bored
Eatin' on some chips that he got from the store
I said I'm bored too, so what's up with that?
Wayne said "Is anyone down to jack?"
Now I can get the AK and you can get the pump
But I don't want no deuce-deuce, 'cause I ain't no chump
Now Mike said, "Dane which one do you choose?"
"I could take the .38 and you can have the Uze"
But before we can jet and be on our way
Some niggas rolled up and they was ready to spray
Rollin' real slow, they turned off the lights
Waitin' until the time was right
A fool jumped out all dressed in Guess?
(Yeah) shot him in the chest
The niggas tried to jet, but the couldn't get far
'cause Mike had the uzi and he aimed it for the car
Ha Ha
Now that's how it's done and we do it good
Just another day in my loked out hood
Now all y'all remember that we can't be stopped
What's the name of my hood?
(Ha ha ha ha)
(Figure that shit out you fools)

Aw yeah, vacation's over, sucker's still pickin' on a 4 leaf clover
As I say mic check
EPMD's in effect
Snappin' necks and cashin' large checks, as I flex then wreck
So E what's next?
Shazam, let me tell you who I am
The E-R-I-C-K, S-E-R-M-O-N
Call me a lumberjack, or a midland warrior
Doin damage to the world worse than the Hurricane Gloria
I'm serious, you can say I'm furious
You're sayin in your mind, "Who is he?" because you're curious
A rare rap style, not heard by the usual
You bite you get damaged, so my brothers stay mutual
While I'm makin and takin, emcees shakin and flakin
Pre-heat my oven to three hundred degrees and start bakin
Emcees like potatoes, beats kickin like Cato
Gettin philosophical like the Greek man Plato (who?)
Greek man Plato (who?) The Greek man Plato
But I'm the A.K.Ato flow, bro
As you all well know, I do a show
Pick up the dough and ho, break to the limo
Money in the pocket, Albee's hands on the ammo
Crack the Olde Gold, as we roll and stroll
Don't play bold sucker, cause you was told
Your spot in the box in eighty-eight was sold
So quit the singin come swingin cause of the beat that I'm bringin
Tryin to wax EPMD, you be U.G.-in
On a heavy narcotic, such as speed or crack
Because your rhyme's mediocre but your tracks are wack
Not fiction but fact black, believe that
Then put away your demo cause the brother is back
And get the bozack, E
As I sing and do my thing I might sing
Jane, or the whole shabang
But if I snap, during the course of the rap
P tap me on the back, throw the crowd a flap
Just to distract, til I'm intact
Get my Fisherman hat, so I can mack
Groove to the rhythm of a funky track
Like ("Yo, you smack me and I'll smack you back")
I come correct with the context
And then next and flex and throw a hex on your whole complex
And then check for a second, yo, then say
(R-E-S-P-E-C-T) Respect!
For me the E Double, or the emcee rap goddess
Cause me and PMD we get ours regardless
So get the bozack, P
Yo, time to get funky and raw
Stompin' mud holes of posses (like who?) like Gigantor
Cause when we roll we come fully equipped
Mic in the hand, tooly, and spare clips
Like a detonator with no ticks I then trip or slip
Or maybe flip while my DJ's on the mix
Never lost a battle and if I did it was fixed
You must be sick of all on the diznick, like a jim hat
Your shit ain't pumpin and your rhymes are wack
'Cause you're a nickel dime sucka, who hangs with Tommy Tucker
Like KRS-One says, you a Part Time Sucka
Who works O.T., to be like me
The Capital P, the M, I'm like D
To slay an emcee, on the S-P-O-T
Leave without a motive or a C-L-U-E
So get the bozack, E
The MC Grand Royal on the microphone
Terrorist, mafioso, a.k. E Capone
I'm no joke on the stroke I broke so don't choke
No hopes folks, I quote note for note
You mind float on the rhyme on I wrote (what?)
And does the Wild Thing, like my boy Tone Loc
It's equipped with the kit that bit the whole shit
Don't catch a nitfit, because my style legit
Brand new from the crew for you no voodoo
A trick from the flicks master Wu Kung-Fu
Equipped with the posse and the time I need
Cock diesel like Rocky and Apollo Creed
So get the bozack, P
Yo, mic checkin, checkin and checkin and checkin
Scanned the crowd, then start wreckin
Either kill or be killed, in the field of hip-hop
Cause if you're slow you blow you get popped mopped and dropped
If you snooze, you lose, here come the oohs and boos
I pop a No-Doz, relax my lips and cruise
Past a pooh putt'n sucka whose all about schemein
Wax the P twice, you must be dreamin
Cause as you moan and groan, from the mouth you foam
Sayin deep down inside, I shoulda left P alone
Cause it's a fact, black, that when I'm loopin the track
To lounge in the Danger Zone, because I'm back
In fact, Jack, before I launch my attack
Premeditate my assassination and come strapped
Playin rough and tough, but when I called your bluff
You tried to post on the microphone doctor and got snuffed
So get the bo-zack
Yo, get the bozack
Yeah, get the bozack
Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack
Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack
Yo, I don't play

Hollywood dolly, pop me some molly
Eagle has landed, dude do you copy
Blowing your ears off, like Van Gogh
Security guard with a big-ass 'fro
Overnight the city lights will guide my way back home
But summer's over, night gets colder, so walk with me tonight
You're like handcuffs baby, now give me the key
You're in a house on the hills among the palm trees
Remember the lights, and the Malibu nights
Gotta head back home got a song to write
Overnight the city lights will guide my way back home
But summer's over, night gets colder, so walk with me tonight
She got a plan and it's all on her face
Just looking for another empty fill to chase
And I know, its time to roll
So lets get the hell out now and, reload
Overnight the city lights will guide my way back home
But summer's over, night gets colder, so walk with me tonight
The world was big when we were young, just you me and a dream
The city's holding the special key, the one that set me free

[Big Moe]
Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West
With plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't trying to go to war
The common denominator in the sitution

Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
c'mon and try to leave your mind with me
Steady be sellin, celebratin, for payin our dues
With so much drank in my cup the soda water don't even move
I's a playa can't associate with the plexin
Bone hard, bitch, Mo City, Texas
And a veteran don't get me wrong cause put you a glass
Pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass
Take a chill pill bill
Blow some kill pop the steal
Since we won't ba seen
Sippin syrup till we leave
From the dirty-third coast it ain't no roach a G
So fill your cup up to the brim and have a toast with me

All I want to do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup

Chorus
[Big Moe]
In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow
Still come up substance make them hit the floor
84's and vouls with the freshes on my lows
Specialy on the fours doors
Bump the strape againts rows
Flosh low concert looking like a lumber yard
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw
Click click clack, get yor wimp ass threw
Payin do's and stayin tru is the rule of the game
On top of the food chains
Bangin screw it won't change for nothin
Chorus 4X

Ok...this is ANOTHER public service announcement
Brought to you in part (punch, yell)
Shut up punk!
Yo ? good good hell yeah
Look, I'm speaking on behalf of D-12
And if you get offended by words like bitch, hoe, sissy, bangin, Homo, lesbian, fudge, fucker, clit, ear
All that shit like that
Then you should turn this shit off right now
Coz thats just some of the shit-no thats the only shit that you're gonna
Hear right here on this album.
It's not that they don't have creativity or some shit like that
That ain't the case
We just like sayin' stuff like that just to fuck wit' ya
Hey! I told you to hold him down, now he's runnin'!
Oh...fuck it (gun shot).
God damn it if you'd just stayed still none of this would have happen to ya!
It just goes to show when you fuck around with us, shit can happen.

ONE! TWO! Were coming for you.
THREE! FOUR! Lock your door.
FIVE! SIX! Suck on my dick.
BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x2)
Now I can feel the needle break, deep inside of my veins.
They try to tell me Im insane, but they make me that way.
So come and take me away.
From this monster that youve made of me.
I feel like dying, erasing all of these memories
Im trapped inside this cage tonight!
You torture my brain with blades and knifes!
I need you to try to save my life!
BEFORE I GO INSANE! (x2)
ONE! TWO! Were coming for you.
THREE! FOUR! Lock your door.
FIVE! SIX! Suck on my dick.
BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x2)
In 7 days my schizophrenia breaks my brain cavity waves.
I'm then left Distorted, decayed!
These faces of insane originated this pain.
And invented these demented ways to break me!
Intoxicated, Im faded inside my dreams.
Motivated on defeating these haters in everything.
Its the only thing that keeps me alive.
It keeps me away from all of your mother fucking lies!!!
Im trapped inside this cage tonight!
You torture my brain with blades and knifes!
I need you to try to save my life!
BEFORE I GO INSANE! (x2)
ONE! TWO! Were coming for you.
THREE! FOUR! Lock your door.
FIVE! SIX! Suck on my dick.
BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x2)
I feel my nails rip my flesh.
I feel Ive gone insane.
I never wanted to hurt you.
But you made me this way.
So now I know Im crazy.
I feel theres no more pain.
These voices call out to me.
Theyre screaming out my name.
ONE! TWO! Were coming for you.
THREE! FOUR! Lock your door.
FIVE! SIX! Suck on my dick.
BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x4)

I'll lay you down
Broken just what you asked for and more
Choking... gasping and gagging...
I can't... stop myself can't... help myself
It's like a tidal wave taking me over and out
Out of my mind
Whiled my teeth just grind
I can hear you cry
Such a sweet release
Bringing you to peace
Please take all that you said
Keep it inside... right in your head
No one will know... no one will hear
Breaking you down... no need to fear not now
I want to know how does it feel inside
Bound, beat, through the night
I want to hear the sound of what you feel
When it's for real
I want to feel it all
I swear I can smell the blood from here
Fell the sweat drip down and mix with tears
It's like a chemical in my brain
Forcing me to act insane
When the flesh is in my clutch
It's done, they're all fucked

Uh, I am a distraction,
Comin' from my spot and I dont signal as I back in.
If cash is beautiful and money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold to Maxim.
Open to my page and admire my desire,
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire,
My voice stands alone even if I'm with the choir,
Got a cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.
Nah, this the record killer for hire.
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require,
Look what I created despite the niggas that hated,
Every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.
The me and bitch the same we feeling so related,
Forest Hill estated or Dennis Caded
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.
So wait just take this,
One line at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, nigga haha
Yeah, I wrote this verse sittin in my new car,
Sometimes where you headed is too far,
It's more about where you are.
And I am everywhere that you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up,
I'm at the label in the elevator,
Send them up

Ooh ooh ahh ahh, my my my my let me get a taste
Of your sweet potato pie
Ooh ooh ahh ahh
My my my my
[Verse 1:]
Yo, it's fatty koo. (ah no, no no no) keep it hot,
Got black cajun cabana models. sweet candy
Sensation, you give me all that I need. up in the
Club, mami, you bouncin and shakin like you don't care. you in your see through victoria's secret underwear.
Girl, you so hot, you make me doo wop. when you shake your fatty, eyes turn, mouths drop.
I wanna see you shake your fatty, please don't stop. (don't stop, don't stop)
Crazy?
[Chorus:]
Ooh ooh ahh ahh. my my my my.

When you feel the rhythm, lose control.
Move your body and get on the dance dloor.
Fatty koo! she's freakin her fatty koo.
Fatty koo! she's freakin her fatty koo.
Fatty koo! she's freakin her fatty koo. fatty koo!
Fatty koo (hey!)
[Verse 2:]
Ay, sexy daddy, I know you like it when I shake my fatty fatty.
I see your eyes lookin at me.
If you want me, you can have me.
Tell me if you want to freak with me. I can be your little fantasy.
You know I like it when you undress me. (baby, we can do it) follow me!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
You already know who's hot & who's not.
You hot, sizzlin in the drop.
Belly dancin don't stop.
Let's get it on, you on top.
So many reasons we got.
No schemes, what I need with a plot?
This is pelle all day, ma.
So what you actin bashful for?
Go'on and shake and give me your encore.
You damn right we want more.
Let's leave the club & go on a detour.
We can make love as we cruise on the seashore.
Givin it up real nice up on the dance floor.
Follow me, be sure.
I got a thing for you, ma, but keep it on the low.
And maybe we can creep after the show.
You like that.
[Chorus]
Belly dance for me
Mmm.
Don't stop.

Yeah
Yeah
Just like bums, we used to stay
In the slums of LA, by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for reps
Sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride
But my mamma never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school
Started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat
Shot an enemy from across the street
Mamma came home, said she got a good job
Daddy did too, now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'
2 months later, "son, we movin"
No more duckin' from shotgun shells
Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
Give it to me now
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Check it out, check it out, check it out
No more rats and no more roaches
Livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell my crack
Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red
Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class
Rubbin' little white girls on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed
I knew I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt
I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch
Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh
I got an F+ in basic math
Give it to me now
Palmdale, (Hell yeah) come back to me
I gotta do one song for my neighborhood (chicken sound)
Palmdale, come back to me
Uh, uh, check it out
I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world
So I bought me some khakis and a Gheri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL
I went to East Palmdale and started slangin' yell
Fo' sho'! I was makin' crazy dough
Shoulda dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut
Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whiskey and Bacardi
I sold dope to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes
Took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
A white man drove up to my spot
He said, â??Hey homeboy, what you got?â??
I put a fat rock inside his hand
About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
â??Get down, punk.â??
Palmdale, (Hell yeah) come back to me
Uh, I need you and I love you baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Can't get drunk, can't get blunted
LA County, 95 hundred
Crips want to take my All-stars
Bloods want to eat my Snicker bars
Them peckerwoods don't want none
but the Mexican's straight own one
Them Essays, ???
That Essays always try to test me
So I jumped off the bed, cause I ain't no punk
Jammed his head up against the bunk
Socked that Cholo in his chin
Black mother fuckers scared to jump in
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor
I kept talkin' shit cause I want some more
Back in town, we get along with the brown
Now I'm in jail, they tryin' to beat me down
Jail is hell, but I'll adapt
Won't hesitate to get in a scrap.
Cause I'm down for mine, and that's for certain
Sittin' in the hole with my knuckles hurtin'
(Palmdale) Palmdale, (Hell yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Yea, check it out homeboy
Now I got a fucked up life
Two bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport
Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see
Different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL
We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams, Lorenz Tate
Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success
But at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin
Thinkin' 'bout things I coulda, woulda, shoulda been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers
(Palmdale) Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began
Palmdale, come back to me
Hey, all the homeboys on the football team, where y'all at man?
Palmdale, come back to me
Hey, wherever you at in the world, I don't care if you in Japan, Africa
Hey, you know how we used to do it, man
Hey, hey, hey
Yo, let me get a Palm (Palm!)
Yo, let me get a Dale (Dale!)
Yo, what do we sell? (Yell!)
Yo, where we gonna go? (We gonna go back to jail!) (4x)
Dale. Palmdale (Hey, everybody just clap your hands)
Dale. Palmdale (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Chicken noise)
Dale. Palmdale
Dale. (Where them Falcons at?) Palmdale.
(It ain't over 'til the fat man sings)
Dale. (Little Rock can't get none. What, what?) Palmdale
Dale. Palmdale

Back in the days, I never snatched pocket books
I just snatch your mind up with the flow and the hook
That's right, be on alert, comin' faster
Corny MC's, body snatcher with the rapture
Dismember your body like I was a raptor
Pluck your eyes out, so you can't see my laughter
Don't care how many gold and platinum plaques you got
I put my foot in your ass up in the spot
A beast break necks, that's right, you couldn't sit through
I'm bone crushin' on the mic like a Pitbull
Foamin' at the mouth, ferocious to start again
Rockin' hard body cardigan with the Timberlands
PF drop the beat, Afu drop the grammar
Was swift with the gift, old school like cold bangers
The five mic slangin', head bangin', chitty, chitty bang bangin'
Name your whole rap crew like I'm gang bangin'
You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at you
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed to
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at you
Am I brother's keeper? Don't get swept beneath the rug
Stomp these posers out like they water bugs
Tired of these rappers with these ice mugs
Claimin' that they spitting slugs but they spitting duds
Tired of these fake thugs, that's lighter than feathers
With all that nonsense, they puttin' together, screamin', "Murder, murder"
I thought they would of learned from Biggie and 2Pac
That you can bring to life, what you spittin' in your art
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you'se a wanksta
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at ya
It's Mr. Spectacular, tacular
'Bout to swat that ass out the sky like he gammara
The flex of ego on your little pedestals
In front of your people, now what you wanna do?
You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at you
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed to
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at you
You can't stop this hard rock, rock, ready to rock this
I got lyrical ability to bring you hot shit
I swat so many cats, it's rainin' birds
'Cause I'm cold as ice, forget the ice in ya watch, kid
Spit more flames than the back of a rocket
Mic check, one, two, linin' up my targets
I be the mad man in front of the cam
That be stealin' ya fans, yup, up on the red carpet
Make more connections than Nextel, ring the bell
My first connection, make you fuckin' lips swell
Make more noise than a terrorist attack
I'm dangerous like anthrax, my voice burn up the wax
Against the way, I put myself up on the map
I'm a dope MC, I put the squeeze on the dope tracks
Body care free on the dope tracks
A hundred 'round banana clip, leave you where you at
You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at you
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed to
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at you

It's the city of jackers, swindlers, pimps and hoes,
and niggas that bang and slang in kilo's.
Where the rule is 'fool we don't play that'
Bomb to your mutherfucking lip, watch it get fat.
4 deep in a car on a mission.
Load up the glock and watch it start spittin'.
Nobody understands the gang mentality.
I don't give a fuck, just want to see some casualties.
And we'll beat your ass down with the quickness.
Busters know that they can't get with this.
Put the sweat down on a fool at the bus stop.
Wrong set, wrong move get smoothe popped.
Gots to make our money on the corner.
Try to sqeeze, nigga please, a straight gonner.
Survival of the fittest with a gun or a knife.
Geah, cause its Compton 4 Life.
One more 'Drive-by Miss Daisy',
Its for the hood and nigga, we straight crazy.
Fools can't cope when we belling.
Throw up your hood cause its Compton we yelling.
Still selling that yayo, oh know.
Watch out for the tape that's made by 5-0.
Look into the eyes of the 12 gauge barrel.
My t-shirt and khaki's with house shoes is the apparel.
Just call me a nigga with a problem.
Better yet a trouble shooter cause I'm a shoot the enemy
when I see the white of his eyes.
You'll have a funeral every night cause on of your homies dies.
Geah, It don't mean nothing to us. Ready to buss
A thousand mutherfuckers and we kick up much dust.
Another dead, chalk up one for the hood tonight.
Geah right, nigga, cause its Compton 4 Life.
Its the city where everybodies in prison.
Niggas keep taking shit, cause ain't nobody given.
So another punk fool I must beat.
Learned the tricks of the trade from the street.
Anxious to put the jack down. Ready and willing.
One more Compton driveby killing.
One more nigga that got jacked cause he's a dummy.
One more fool that got smoked for the money.
And we got evil ass bitches, just like witches.
Got to keep the hoes because they set up snitches.
Niggas run off at the mouth here goes the nine.
Peel your cap if you want to drop the dime.
Go to jail, hell might as well. Be off with the
head so I bail from the police officer.
Cause if I surrender from the fight.
It won't be no more Compton 4 Life. Geah!

CHORUS:
First in flight (repeated 4X)
Gil Scott-Heron:
(Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky)
[Gift of Gab]
FREE! Like a bird out in the wind in the night
Like a 747 to LA that's in flight
FREE! Like a garden flourishing in the wind
Like a student bout to do it when he's graduatin
FREE! From any of the energy perception
Can never be defined create the definition within
FREE! Just lovin life itself and never pretend to be
Anything other than the man I was meant to be
Travel through time and get a glimpse of the centuries
To come a better day is promised remember
FREE! Like my nephew in a few months about to be out the
penitentiary
Meditation(repeated 9X)
Chorus
[Gift of Gab]
UH! I never hesitate about a reluctant mind
Just put the peddle to the metal see what ya find
You back there slouchin over won't you pick up your spine?
Let's make it really really happen live up this time
Cause you can choose to say "Good morning God" or
"Good God, morning"
With black clouds storming
I walk without umbrellas into these woods
Don't need em cause the mighty trees will shelter me good
I'm eating berries from the bushes of the heavenly good
From the ?stakes/steaks? the power came to us whenever we stood
Reverberatin out we're reachin each and every hood
Whenver we could the spiritual anatomy fool
But never take the credit for it be	cause that'd be rude
It's just the way in life we searchin for that had to be new
You gotta work it though cause everyday ain't Saturday fool
Evolve into a better life and be happy with you and me
Chorus
[Gil Scott-Heron]
The first to fly
The first to strive
The first to fight to stay alive
The first to win
The first to strike
The first to live
The first in flight
[Gift of Gab]
RISE! Like the sun up at the crack of the dawn
Like a wakin child in the morning stretchin and yawnin
RISE! Like an infant being held in the light
Like the smoke from an incense when it's ignited
RISE! If you're sleepin won't you open your eyes again
The greatest high be that natural high within
No need to force the progression just ride the wind
You'll know the answer to the where and why and when
If you keep workin for your search you will find the end
Though at the end you find it only begins again
See at the end you'll see it only begins again
And everything you learn you're only rememberin
Cause you're
Chorus (repeat 4X)
[Gift of Gab: repeat 2X]
It's me
Let your mind and your soul be free
Work to shine meet your goal believe
Spread that kind of L-O-V-E
Take some time off the lonely
[Gil Scott-Heron: repeat to end]
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky

My understanding is zero for the simple fact, I'm not a hero
Born broke, beat up and always acting evil
I'm playin' for keeps, I gots to carry my shank
Keep my hands on my thang while I'm checkin' my bank
I gots nothin' to lose and I'd rather be six feet deep
I sing the blues 'cause I'm deep and I don't sleep
My understanding's zero watchin' channel fuzz
I don't like the fuzz, I'm like was not was
And if I was not, then I was not or will be
You better murder me man, I'm tellin' y'all to kill me
The U N H O L Y, that's what they call me
My last word's is like, "Fuck all y'all, G"
Before I die, I'm takin' muthafuckaz out with me
And when I die the meat wagon's gonna come and get me
My understanding's zero 'cause I'm just a zero
I hear no, I say no, I see no, no evil Yo!
Is I crazy, Is I am, Is I am?
My butcher knife's bloody so fuck a film flam
And 'bout your God, 'bout your God
Your God is money man, in God we trust
The ill rhyme I bust, oh!
I fall into a state, I'm in depression
Playin' me a game of true confessions
I want y'all to know, I want y'all to know
If you grow up in the ghetto
Your understanding's zero

Huh! I couldn't be nobody but myself, you know that
But then they all started talking
They were talking about love being gone
In my house
They said that there ain't much left to love
Well, there's always something to love if you're familiar enough to recognize it
I mean have you cried for anything lately?
And I don't mean for your friends or your bills or yourself
I mean, for this!
When do you think it's time to love something the most, child?
When it's successful? And have made everything easy for us, huh?
That ain't the time at all
It's when its reached it's lowest and you don't believe in it anymore
And the world done kicked it and its tail enough that its lost itself!
Yes, that's when, when nobody cares
That's right, nobody

Listen
All my fellas please listen up to me
I sincerely say these words
What goes around, comes back around
I hope you feel me, 'cuz I'm not hating no
If you keep doing these girls wrong, somebody's gonna do us wrong
It's reality, I need you here with me, if we keep breaking
These girls hearts, somebody's gonna break our hearts
It's reality, now I know what I need
Is one girl to love
Give her all of me
One girl to love
Give her everything she needs, yeah, yeah
It's time for me to hang up my cleats, 'cuz my playing games are over
And I need the right one here with me, my friends don't understand why
Lately I don't hang out all night
Someday they'll feel me, but I'm not hating no
If you keep doing these girls wrong, somebody's gonna do us wrong
It's reality, it's reality, need you here with me, if we keep breaking
These girls hearts, somebody's gonna break our hearts
It's reality, now I know what I need
Is one girl to love
Give her all of me
One girl to love
Give her everything she needs, yeah, yeah
Only if I had a girl like you, so all some insecure
Searching for perfection would be true, words cannot describe the feeling
I pray to God that I meet you some day
Maybe in church on Sunday, I'll be patient all I need
Is one girl to love
Give her all of me
One girl to love
Give her everything she needs, yeah
Is one girl to love
Give her all of me
One girl to love
Give her everything she needs
One girl to love
Give her all of me
One girl to love
Give her everything she needs

And we say back way to all the trouble makers
Better fix up your brains because you are the biggest fakers
Come in the place better know who you are
Self defence is no offence
The scales of justice are weighed down on one side
Freemasons on the case you know you're gonna get a rough ride
Hold tight even if you know your rights
It's just a piece of paper unless you're prepared to fight
For ten years one hell of a long time
To rot in a cell when you've committed no crime
Another innocent man forced to carry the can
Free Satpal Ram
Free Satpal Ram
Another innocent man
Whose word against who?
Whose word against who?
The degenerate crew
Out on the town thought they had something to prove
Self defence - only offence - had to protect himself from all the murdering fools
Cutting remarks on account of his race
A plate to his chest and a glass to his face
An Asian fights back can't afford to be meek
With your back against the wall you can't turn the other cheek
And its back way to all the trouble makers
Better fix up your brain because you're the biggest fakers
Come in the place better know who you are
Free Satpal Ram
Another innocent man
Birmingham six
Bridgewater four
Crown prosecution totting up the score
Kings Cross two
Guildford four
Winston Silcott - man how many more ?
Satpal attacked in a restaurant by racists
Now the brother's been locked up on a life time basis
Convicted of murder but what's never mentioned
Self defence was his only intention
ADF once again taking to the stand
Witness the jailing of an innocent man
Kicking up a fuss because it could happen to us
Time to join in the fight back
Because enough is enough
And it's back way to all the trouble makers
Better fix up your brains because you're the biggest fakers
Come in the place better know who you are
Free Satpal Ram

Never will it stop,
The 50 in the duffel won't crush,
It settles to the bottom like dust,
Fuck what ya heard,
You ain't countin' paper like us.
A million in the ceiling I can touch.
Go-getter.
I come from the corner like most niggas,
Now from afar, I toast niggas, roast niggas,
Anywhere, whichever the coast nigga,
Compare me to them 2 ghost niggas, Hail Mary.
Heart break when they tales fairy,
I kissed that girl and I likes it, like Kate Perry.
The tongue-tester, niggas on the corner
Juggle O's for the king, like a jester.
Child of a lesser, God, so when I drop the top
It's my way of feeling closer to the Lord!
Reaching for the heavens, 'till then, I settle for the 7,
30 floors upper room key, at the Western.
With her on her back, and her on her knees,
My ghetto ass trying to pronounce they dungarees.
I say Rav, they say Roxy mon',
They think it's real cute while they giving me dome.
Liva.
Heh, the cross I bear,
So fly in that purple label cloth I wear.
No matter the cost, I make Porsche like fear,
Every stitch, every seam, when I floss, y'all stare.
Ferrari 500 them horse I tear,
I circle, I veer, y'all pause like deer
In the headlights, mami play red light, green light,
And hop that red torch I steer.
There's no lLaw I've feared,
Arm glowin' like a roadside flare,
King-pin, so the soft I shared,
I carried, I huddled, I dared,
I muscled, I bled, I sweated, I teared,
Got crowned 'n got cheered.
You 10 Grand quarter-pound ration,
Went 36 flat, that's a asking,
Now two-thirds got it for a fraction, a cinder
Put in the dash 'n the fender,
Dryer sheets, that cover that scent that it renders.
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop.
Never will it stop,
The 50 in the duffel won't crush,
It settles to the bottom like dust,
Fuck what ya heard,
You ain't countin' paper like us.
A million in the ceiling I can touch.
And still don't nothing move but the money,
Nothing like 50 bricks, wrapped like the Mummy.
With the return ensures the second coming,
So tongue-numbing nigga, you can bet your last.
Not a gram off either, you can bet your ass!
I stay with the fifth, since niggas want to grab,
Fast-life, get it y'all is on the fast,
And them hos never say no, 'less they on they rag.
Louie bags, I trick 'em with good faith,
In hopes they return the favor, with good face.
Mentally, my mind in a good place,
Wake up e'ery morning admiring landscape
Hell, even my garage a menage,
Like my hoes exotic, same as my cars.
Million-dollar deposit, you suffer from withdrawals,
I got in the game in the bag like I'm Clause.
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop.
Never will it stop,
The 50 in the duffel won't crush,
It settles to the bottom like dust,
Fuck what ya heard,
You ain't countin' paper like us.
A million in the ceiling I can touch.

[Verse 1]
Cops bagged me one night, looking for the blow
Wen't from Bronxhouse to bookings, bookings to the show
From the show to the crib, to the kitchen cookin' Os
Kitchen to the car, to the street lookin' for Hos
Lookin' for hos, to straight up baggin' one
From my game in her brain, ain't no wagon, hun (Ain't no wagon bitch)
From the wagon, garage to the house
Dinnin' room, kitchen, kitchen to the couch
Couch to the bedroom, my dick's in her mouth
Bedroom to front door, this bitch getting out (See ya')
Front door, to "You know where the Jacuzzi is?"
Dress cooley, but usually the Coogi kid, bouchie kid
Tell ya boo-bee, a doo-bee did
She a houchie groupie Cooley is
Who am I? Come on, can't be for-reala
Went from Cam to Killa, killa to scrilla, Gorilla
From killa to Sky-Scrappers, from sky-scrappers
High papers, that's my nature
Do five you now, why'all die later
Come to your wake, look at you; "Hi hater"
From the wake to lot, another boogie
From the lot to the hill, to cop somethin' ugly (Ugly)
From the hill to that state Dakota
From Dakota to the corna, get that bakin' soda, KILLA
[Chorus:]
Yo, where you from dog? Harlem boy, boy
Oh this nigga getting' money? Holla boy, boy
Oh this cat over front? Fuck boy, boy
He keep that shit up..fucking drop boy, boy
Oh you got that hydro? You lyin' boy, boy
If you need that dope, though? We got boy, boy
But watch your back: from the cops' boy, boy
Cause they paper? They want to stop boy, boy
[Verse 2]
Aiyoo, I heard you out there shorty..slingin' boy, boy
Oh MY god, oh boy, boy
Be careful of the motherfuckin' boys, boy
Me though? I run THEM boys, boy
Lloyd, Floyd, Roy, Soy, Black Bridicks
Bitches too, joy toy, what
Cat like you? Call you a Gladiator
Give her oral, and you happy, Glad-he-ate-her (Stupid)
Put ? on the pussy, she a masturbator
Put my dick in her mouth, that's what fascinate her
I'm a legendary now, past the player, past the player
Got the rock? Pass that player
I'm like Betty Crocker with cake, that's in layers
I had city issues before, ask the mayor (Ask him)
He said "Cam'ron, please stop this crack behavior"
(Shut the fuck up, man)
He ain't know '96, I had a knack for Gators
I come through, laugh at haters, bitches too
want to act, setback, relax a player
Cause all these hos jelly you hard
When your purlieus are hard
And the Chanel, Sklies to Scarfs
I stick to their stomachs, their belly's will barf
And I take them to the telly where their belly will force
"Why fucking me like that? Calm down that's my uterus
my serfix, my ovaries" Relax, I'm doin' this
Welcome to exclusiveness
You about to take a week off, the ultimate freak off
Hit Jimmy, Jeulz, Sean, and Zek off
Wait a minute ma', wipe that cum on your cheek OFF
I hate me a filthy ho, but I like me a silly ho
That way you really blow
Havin' to fuck cats, she don't really know
Then take all her money; you don't feel me, though
You don't understand my pimp-ery
You love them you got sympathy, fuck that, I'm into me

I was gonna clean my room until I got high
I was gonna get up and find the broom but then I got high
My room is still messed up and I know why
'Cause I got high
I was gonna go to class before I got high
I coulda cheated and I coulda passed but I got high
I am taking it next semester and I know why
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high
I was gonna go to work but then I got high
I just got a new promotion but I got high
Now I'm selling dope and I know why
'Cause I got high

I was gonna go to court before I got high
I was gonna pay my child support but then I got high
They took my whole paycheck and I know why
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high
I wasn't gonna run from the cops but I was high
I was gonna pull right over and stop but I was high
Now I am a paraplegic, and I know why, 'cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high
I was gonna pay my car note until I got high
I wasn't gonna gamble on the boat but then I got high
Now the tow truck is pulling away and I know why
'Cause I got high

I was gonna make love to you but then I got high
I was gonna eat yo pussy too but then I got high
Now I'm jacking off and I know why
'Cause I got high

I messed up my entire life because I got high

Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk and I know why
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high
I'm gonna stop singing this song because I'm high
I'm singing this whole thing wrong because I'm high
And if I don't sell one copy I know why
'Cause I'm high
Because I'm high
Because I'm high

Only thing I know better stop worrying bout mine and get theirs

The mic needs to be a little bit more crystal)
I don't want to hear the good time is coming..
Don't want to hear the voices in back of me...

See the bigger, picture, I'm out for the grand prize
I'm not a role player, senor, I'm the franchise
[Trife Da God]
Aiyo, with Trife sweatin', every bullet is life threatenin'
And you could get a chest full of slugs in a slight second
Yo, my nine milli' pistol's really official
So you can Analyze That like DeNiro and Billy Crystal
[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, it's Ghost with the sky blue kufi, smashin' groupies
Leavin' them fiend out, like New Jack's Pookie
Every line is like ninety nine dimes
Shrine auditorium rap, aquarium's in my wall in the back
[Method Man]
Now that you know my name, niggaz know my game
If you feel me, then you know my pain
I seen you rap dudes done stole my slang, try'nna hold my fame
Ain't even strong enough to hold my thang
Wanna flow, fuck with me though, baby, I'mma try'nna see dough
My squad got them caught in the yard screamin' for C.O
Every time we blow, it raise the prize on the padrico
Ya'll niggaz shoot your guns like Shaq shootin' a free throw
[Trife Da God]
Spark the fluid, hop out and park the Buick
I got fiends blowin' CREAM like Martha Stewart
We on that up north jail shit, harder than steel chips
Ya'll niggaz better bail quick, before you inhale clips
[Streetlife]
Ya'll better get low, before I let the Tec blow
Streetlife, I'mma try'nna get more dollars than Kreftlo
The whole hood echoes, every time my nine let go
Get out of line or steal your life like a klepto
[Ghostface Killah]
When Biggie died, they came out with Biggie fries
Big biscuits got me over, in the streets wide
Prada gloves, layin' for thugs, prayin'
Drop a bronco buster, G-37 on the rap patient
[Method Man]
I'mma leave the shit this summer in that H2 Hummer now
Mami gotta call your bean ass ay caramba, now
Eh boy el loco, oh no, I ain't Yoko
My hoes, I keep 'em lookin' good, right, but no dough

(Eat a dick up)
"Stick up, stick up, stick up kids
Still don't nothin' move but the money"
Strugglin', jugglin', got it to the black man
Eatin' the scams like I was motherfuckin' Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the roughneck niggas with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin' for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin' streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, 'cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin' up spots and jumpin' in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin'
And always keep a hand on the gat
'Cause a niggas straight strugglin'
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin'
I thought about bumpin', but mother-fuck jugglin'
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
'cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin'
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac 'cause the dogg got it goin' on
If you come up steppin' you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin' house, I'm strugglin'
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
'Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin' in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
'Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin'
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin' changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggas on they back
Till I call back, niggas runnin' free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin' and strivin', that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin' on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin' motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin'
See me on the block, strugglin'
And rollin' with the roughnecks 'nough checks cashed
I get in niggas ass, blast
Straight strugglin

Black gangster(repeat 12x)
I met this out of town player who wanted to set up a trap
He said he'd pay me and my boys if we would watch his back
I told my other partner exactly where we kept tha sacks
Then early in tha mornin' told em we got jacked
I learnt to get what was mine before I hit tha scene
Learnt to double-up my money before I turned 18
At ten in tha mornin' if you pay me a visit
You can catch me cookin' up dem chickens just like j.r. crickens
My partner from new york he gave me a beak
He need 9 on tha 13th at 20 a piece
I copped 15 g's from my personal cut
And he gave me five more and told me thats for wakin' him up
Chorus
(black gangster 8x)
Verse 2:
I got this worker on tha street sayin' he not gon' pay
He say I'm fly at tha mouth and plus I shorted him weight
I went right to his house on tha same day
Knocked tha windows out his car say playa what chu' say
Ain't nobody takin' form us e.p.v.'s(east point veterans)
We'll wake tha whole house up for a set of car keys
One time this old lady looked at me
And say she see tha truth in tha strong young blood like it used to be
I keep my stash and everything on lock
And keep my business to myself and watch my back 'cause thats all I got
It's been like that ever since I was young
And if anybody want some betta bring them a gun
////beat stops interlude
Cool breeze talking
Cool beeze: ay man hold on man
Who is this sucka who keep runnin' his mouth
I know he ain't from around here!
Other guy: listen to me champ calm down
He's nobody this sucka boy went from sellin' hot dogs last week
To wanting to fight tha champ this week. forget about him.
Cool breeze: i'mma i'mma who is he? I'm tha champ.
Other guy: I don't know who he is,
But tha playa fishin' wit cha champ he tryin' to
Get you to bite. he's nobody forget about em
Cool breeze: wha, what chu' mean,
If I'm tha champ then anything that come through
Here gotta come through me. who is he!?
Other guy: see there you go, you loosin' it, ya loosin' it
Cool breeze: who is he!!!? aw...
///beat and rapping continues
We had this kingpin who came in wit 200 pounds
And every player in this town
Was talkin' bout' layin' him down
One of my people hit me late on a monday night
And said he settin' up his shop where we at, yeah right
If you ever in tha south and you doin' some dirt
First thing first my folks they git work
Everybody in this trap they game is tight
We gotta lock on this block and anything you like
All my customers they say I got tha ohh-wee
When you hit it one time it make you say ohhhh-weeee!!
Man this brother that I hang wit they some (gangsters)
Some (gangsters)

Chorus
Black gangsters...

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black, maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from, from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged, you get laughed at, you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us, black maybe
Black maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe

There is calm then there is storm
There is peace then there is war
There is love then we are torn,
oh Lord!
There's a void then there's a song
There's a death then we are born
There is blood then we are home,
oh Lord
If you're free prove it!
If you're free prove it!
If you're not loose the chains on your soul!
Come, freedom!
There are slaves and there are kings
All are bound till they are free
All misplaced till they believe
oh, Lord!
If you're free prove it!
If you're free prove it!
If you're not loose the chains on your soul!
Come, freedom!
If freedom is free as they say it is
Where we go where they displayin' it?
We wanna start where the chains end
Is the promised land up for the taken (take it)?
No one was free on a slave ship (oh), only a slave would enslave men (oh)
Egypt is still in our nature, it changes faces, face it (who liberates them?)
I'ma need more then they payin' me I don't need money I need a eagle wing liberty
Free indeed hidden deep is a plea, I'd rather die than be Steeped beneath tyranny
Oh just like I got it I give it like (oh), grace to the nations No hate for you (no)
We integrated we be interracial, You lovin' your neighbors then go let 'em know!
If you're free prove it!
If you're free prove it!
If you're not loose the chains on your soul!
Come, freedom!

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Swizz Beatz yes

She bang bang boom!
[Drag-On]
Know me from Split These Bars
Know me from Down Bottom
Now I switch my cars
Got a house down bottom
If you want to come and cop them bricks you know Uptown got 'em
Tell your man be easy ma, he don't want no problem
I'm bout my money man, I got that country slang
Look at the way she shake that thing
But you plottin' on my bling
But we don't play them type of games around here
Keep the gray pound somewhere around here
Please don't let your shorty loose around here
Cause I'll take her lil' ass around there
Shorty booty bangin'
Tell me what you thinkin'
Drag keep em bouncin'
Swizz keep em singin'
[Chorus: x2]
[Drag-On]
My money got long figgas
Her rings on the wrong finger (Hey shorty)
You done married that wrong nigga
What's your sign ma?
Let me guess ma, Capricorn ma?
Am I Wrong ma? (uh-uh)
What you sayin' who you bangin' who you slidin' wit
Pack your friend who you bringin' who she ridin' wit
Cause we ain't ready tryin' to stay around here
My thugs around cause there's too many clowns around here (Hey shorty)
We don't smoke that brown here
Strictly that green here, that the black green here (yeah)
Do the damn thing, sex-a-bang-bang
It's all the same thing
Swizz make em sing
[Chorus: x2]
[Drag-On]
Mommy put ya hands up, hush ya man up
Tryin' to play gorilla
My clips are bananas, so don't slip
I do what gangstas do, but don't get it confused
My floors mostly sand so you ain't gotta bring ya shoes
My crib is half house, half beach
Sit yo booty on this king size and see the sea
I'm a lil' freaky-o, I might lick ya toes
I got more zero's on my one's than Cheerio's
See your stilleto, shoes, your mac lip gloss
And ain't a dime chick that Drag didn't floss
Shorty booty bangin'
Tell me what you thinkin'
Drag keep em bouncin'
Swizz keep em singin'
[Chorus]

It's the return of the lyrical lunatic still kickin' rough shit
What you say, I'll slap your stank ass, bitch
I shake and build my craft like an architect
Teflon style rhymes be Gortex with the highness of the ruler on my cock
All this over hip and the hop bullshit gonna stop it be Keith not Bill
Murray not Sweat, your politics be politically incorrect
We keep it hot like sauce, flows be definite like, well, of course
Def Squad go off a rough course
You weak wack niggas, can't do me none
Five hundred radian height, I run with the sun
Apparently you need to check my pedigree
And do the knowledge to the S C I E N C E
Fake ones fear it, real ones cheer it
'Cause they all feel me from the wound of the human spirit
With logic and breaches, I justify my means, see you on the scene
Fuck you up like Tyson did the big screen
And fag'll rock, yeah, bees like that if you kill my dog I'm a slay your cat
Say word, say word, say word, say word
Say word, say word, say word, say word
Face off with Castor Troy, strap your boys
Hook y'all to answer cant bang half the noise
Ask Dunkin Hines got my shits twice as moist
Plus status, do it to a T B A for rackets
Pull out the Vicks 44 cough suppressant
Then talk about me on HBO cab confessions
Got a, bitch gobanas, hangin' out the Honda
She should have thought about no before she smoked my dime up
I smoke with the Luniz out in the bay
Before you get smoked, I ask who you with wit Jay
It's bizarre, hyphen are ake mics dissolve
My penmanship run concurrent with lightnin' rods
I clap you in the spine when I grab on mine
You so soft, I should call you 101.9
When I pull out the denim and break the call minum
You stupid, I act stupid right along with ya
Say word, say word, say word, say word
Say word, say word, say word, say word
I step out the truck like you want somethin'
Make you either mad faced you punked up and start frontin'
Fly guy, the type to flash the figure
Same type who would cold back stab his nigga
I know you, you a hater
You might pull a plaug at a concert to stop the crowd motivator
Your envy is strong, outlook is wrong
Don't compete with the vet my track recs too long
Mercedes wack but they're pumpin' the song
Recitin' it word for word when my tune comes on
Clowns your whole steez is out of bounds
You're carrying and walkin' when you shouldn't be talkin'
Bitch him, call Cube and the Mob to lench him
Call up his pop duke put 5 on his pension
There's a few things I've got to mention
Def Squad be the name and boys the definition, that's my word
Say word, say word, say word, say word
Say word, say word, say word, say word

[Kayo]
Yeah
I'd like to purpose a toast..
Uh
Dark rum, chased by bad dreams
Intoxicate my soul for these goals and mad schemes
I'm.. alright, it's gon' be a hell of a night again
I'm jus' tryin'a write again 'bout things that are right within
Man, this the life, i don't ever want this night to end
Who am i kidding? I just do this to excite my friends..
See my music's like a voice for my sins,
for my redemption, I'm like fuck it and just.. binge
'cause life's like the best nights and the worst days
Frequent fights 'cause you missed your wifes birthday
Lose friends but gain many acquaintances,
fake as shit, and always up in ya face with it,
but I ain't even see it
Dawg, I'm in that zone
They keep tellin' me, "man, just leave that shit alone"
But naw, dread, see life's a celebration...
I need that hangover, that's when the pain's over, so..
fuck sober
[Chorus]
[Classified]
I don't wanna deal with the hangover,
I guess I gotta deal with the hangover,
[Jim Cuddy]
I've got the sweetest hangover,
I don't want to get over..
I don't want to get over..
[Classified]
Now on the road to life,
I mean life on the road..
It's hard to wake up every morning and get on the go
but vamanos, get up!
I love the job I chose
We party every night, maybe that's the wrong approach..
but what do I know?
I just know my body's sore,
my head's splittin',
and my driver's at the lobby doors
My crew's waitin' for me, tonight's another town
I just gotta get some rest before I shut it down
Pick it up, show time
Tonight I'll take it easy,
'til I realize how many people came to see me
Don't wanna slack or perform half-ass,
I rock every show like this could be the last Class.. act
and it's hard to party without drinkin',
give me just one,
but I ain't a social drinker, when I start I usually get drunk
Guess I'm goin' all night, continuin' the trend
Then I'll wake up next morning and I'll do it all again
This hangover is settin' in, and...
[Chorus]
[Classified]
I don't wanna deal with the hangover,
I guess I gotta deal with the hangover,
[Jim Cuddy]
I've got the sweetest hangover,
I don't want to get over..
I don't want to get over..

This what happen when I think about you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my play of ways got way to complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go, they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say that way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so
So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
Break it down, yeah
Yes sir, check
We use to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man it's true, ex's change, yeah
Guess you changed for the better (Better)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so
So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
For real shawty
Yeah I know
Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm low key feelin' you, don't be cynical
I'ma fuck you over, wanna fuck you over then again the truth
Is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl I swear to God them, hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em "Don't try him"
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise him
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and fourth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass on my grip, college
Make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say wassup witchu? You got my soul

When you here this news you might hit the ceelin but I'm willin to let you kno

Chorus
Ya sista I've been wit her for a while now and theres u can do bout it 2x
Verse2

You reachin for your tool and no need for no beef so stop actin irrational im
Still that same brotha who had ya back for you you know I never hurt you or
Tried to be foul besides you don't want your niece to grow up with out a daddy
Around thats right your baby sister is quite pregnant we allready checked and

Hook
Ya sista you kno I love her I would never hurt her never leave her 6x
No no no no in back ground

Yeah
Make my vocals sound sexy
Come on man, come on man okay
[Chorus]
It feels so wrong cos it feels so right
But its all right its OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking my ball and going home home
I'm that guy man
Shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mud holes in ya ass girl
Now lets cuddle
Blood curdlin' you're gurglin' on your blood
What I do for my next trick
I'm filling one duffle
I think I might just do something a little less subtle
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath
While I put a catheter in
And jump in the bath with her
In my spider-man mask man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachio's damn I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio man rolling a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on
God damn man are you that much of an asshole
[Chorus]
I'm like Houdini
Tuck my teenyeenyweeny between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini believe me homie
You don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Wiener smothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice
You should have seen it mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's
With McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos
[Chorus]
Shady what are you doing chewing on a human
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back boom
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Using the bathroom vacuum and a raccoon
Skewing a rat or cat screwing a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
You should be glad he didn't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance I'm back doing my dance ooh
But there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read eighty four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
Cos I'm scared there's monster's under my bed
Kelly Pickler hit my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti dike well I can pee pee and write your name
[Chorus]

No questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
That hides the snakes of America
So they watch it, now I walk with caution
More careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
But I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
War is big biz, ask an economist
Speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist
I want black and brown unity
But cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line
We call it art, some call it a crime
It's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
On drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
The villain trained by the hero for the killing
Now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
They might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
Just listen to the knowledge I give
If more than half the budget goes to military spending
Less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
And justice for all who are miserable
Voice in Spanish escuscha la verdad en la musica
Yeah Babu, Dilated Peoples
Neighborhood Watch, worldwide
Expansion, Iriscience
Evidence, Babu

Gettin Krunk wit Lil Jon, he da livest in the south
Fuck around and you get wires in your mouth
Cowards I despise and my power keeps on risin
Niggas try to hate me but they keep recognizin

And ya all got guns but ya scared to use 'em
Six million ways to die, nigga choose one
I'm a Braveheart I'll be right here
why'all talk shit but I smell fear, motherfucker!
[Chorus]
[Jungle]
Ay yo, all these niggas they afraid of the Bravehearts
I'll take a razor open your face up
I tried to tell these niggas we don't play
I run up on you broad day with a A-K
Cornball I can make your heart beat stop
Pop pop your body drop from a couple shots
When you see me in the street, we can handle the beef
If you see me in jail you know you dead meat
I be fighting and stabbin, shooting and laughing
My ratchet blast on top of you bastards
Committing sins in Cincinnati
We'll drive by in all black caddy's
A 21 gun salute
Your last words be, please Jungle don't shoot
Pussy, I'll put a slug between your eyes
And stand there and watch your punk ass die
[Wiz]
I'm fuckin' wit them, Bravehearts
My niggas is coming we just don't stop
why'all niggas is running I'm just goin pop
I twist up my gun up and slap your mouth
With Lil John down south
My religion is green motherfucker too late
Since birth, I'm cursed, the worst motherfucka in da state
Time and time again you niggas back down, laugh now
Fuck ya numbers nigga ya'll all fake
The hunt is on, fuck if I'm wrong, test my dead arm
Robbery, heavily armed, might leave him gone
Bang him duff him, actin like he don't know what's going on
Hang em' rush em' get his clown ass his teammates wrong
And oh he got a 22, give him the gauge the brave way
God ain't going to save his bitch ass today
Wait I'ma Braveheart I'll be right here
why'all talk shit but I smell fear, mothafuckas!
[Chorus]

Life, what the fuck is life for niggas like us?
Been waking up to another muthafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier,
A nigga that seen
Everything in my muthafuckin' eyes
I seen my parents get killed
To my muthafuckin' eyes
I seen my brother kill his-self in my eyes
I seen Pac, yak, die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?
Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me
I'm seeing demons
I wake up screaming
Who believe me or was I dreaming?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes
Til they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us
That's what jail for
Adolescence young teens turned violent
It's floating, in a world turned silent
'Cause you could be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched
I live life High Speed
Moving a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny
Making decisions carelessly
Yeah it's me, yo nigga man child
Bomb first stand proud
Ain't looking for hand-outs
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
And I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get mo' so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me (You can be touched)
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga, Lonnie just got hit with 10, 10 years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways
So forever it's on, baby
My Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched
Why grieve this life
Planted by the fiends and pipes
Green lights so
I'm seeing-seeing everything twice
Pretty much of nothing nice
(Naw) we sucking it up
Even when we get a job, we fucking it up
Like it can't happen to us
I could never be a bum
Yeah right, you wound up one
God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up
Look and learn
Next it could be your turn, word
Yes this a felonies' hobby
That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supporting me
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie,
Secretz to war licks, and score shit
Share between clients and homies
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong
And it's survive for the strong
Living outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched
My Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched

And on the cool check in
Center stage on the mic
And we're puttin' it on wax
It's the new style
Four and three and two and one (What up!)
And when I'm on the mic the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick
Be-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.
Ah yeah, that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it, I know it's good
The rhymes I write, you wish you would
I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secausus, I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'
There it is
Kick it!
Father to many, married to none
And in case you're unaware I carry a gun
Stepped into the party, the place was over packed
Saw the kid that dissed my home boy and shot him in the back
I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank, I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice, twin sisters in my bed
Their father had Aids so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlie's I like are underage (Check it!)
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father, he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green
I've got the girlie's numbers from the places I been
There it is
Kick it!
You wanna know why, because I'm
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party and you know what I did the Smurf
Taxing all females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill I'm chilly most
We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west
K-I-N-G-A-D whammy
All the fly ladies are on my jammy
Went to the prom, wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
Spent some bank, I got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo
Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies
Feel the beat
Hmm Drop
Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day
Just me, my posse and M.C.A.
A lot of beer, a lot of girls and a lot of cursing
Twenty-two automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble, some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face
Like the bun to the burger, like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry to the apple, to the peach to the plum
I'm the king of the Ave., and I'm the king of the block
I'm M.C.A., and I'm the King Adrock
I'm Mike D., I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
Beastie Boys fly the biggest heads

featuring Thyme
Hey yo what's up man? Hey yo you been here all day man
Ya'll been here every weekend man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you whack!
What?!? I ain't whack nigga I got some raps for all ya'll
Nigga my raps fresh I'ma bust my raps first
you can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man I'm going first
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first,
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say,
I'm fresh, I'm fresh
Thyme:
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
Chorus: Thyme
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Verse 2: Eminem
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess
Chorus: Thyme
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out!! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo let me get that mic man
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!!
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit

I remember summer girl
We fell apart
We were so close girl
I never thought another in my life
But you moved on
Hope you're doing fine
They say you're in love
But I know you still think of me
1 - Even though he may kiss your body real nice
I know you think of me girl every time
Even though he makes love to you every night
I know you think of me girl every time
Now I hear he treats you real good
Makes you so happy but
That cannot compare to all the time and love that we've invested
It's o.k. I've moved on
So take care of yourself but
Just remember these words
I know you still think of me
Repeat 1
When he runs fingers through your hair
I know you think of me every time
When he gives you bubble baths
I know you think of me every time
When he dives for your treasure
I know you reminisce every time
About love we shared can't compare to nothing babe
Repeat 1 till end

Damn, this is V-tino
Pick up the phone and come home
Never was the one to fall in love
I was just a guy to hit and run
And then I met this special girl
And like a fool I pushed her out my world
I never thought I would be here
Standing here in misery
Shouldve brushed off all my dirty work
Got Bobby lookin like a jerk
I should have laid it down
But I messed around and let you down
Things aint been the same girl, since you been away girl
Wish you would come back home
All I do is reminisce about you
I wish you were here with me lady
And all day long I day dream about you
Im missing your loving lady
I cant go on if I cant have you
Its driving me, oh, so crazy
Wont you come home?
Wont you come home?
Home is where you belong, belong, belong, belong, belong
I got the keys right here for you, baby
Home is where you belong, belong, belong, belong
Home is where your body needs to be, home is where you belong
You cannot tell me that you dont miss Bobby
You cannot tell me that you dont love Bobby, no more
Baby, come home to where you belong
Home is where you belong
If I could go back in time
Id make sure that I treat you right
My playing days are all gone
Without you girl Im so lost
When I reflect on things I did
Girl I was wrong and childish
One more chance is all ask
Trade all of my money just to have you back
I should have laid it down
But I messed around and I let you down
Things aint been the same girl, since you been away girl
Wish you would come back home
All I do is reminisce about you
I wish you were here with me lady
And all day long I day dream about you
Im missing your loving lady
I cant go on if I cant have you
Its driving me, oh, so crazy
Wont you come home?
Wont you come home?
Home is where you belong, belong, belong, belong, belong
Home is where you belong, belong, belong, belong
Home is where you belong, yeah
Home is where you belong
You cannot tell me that you dont miss Bobby
You cannot tell me that you dont love Bobby, no more
You cannot tell me that you dont miss Bobby
You cannot tell me that you dont love Bobby, no more
Oh, baby, home is where you belong
So come back home baby
Home is where you belong
Everyday I try to reach you
But you won't never take my calls
You got me actin like Im crazy
In a room filled with padded walls
Im trapped now and I need you now
Doctor please heal me now, oh, feel this pain that Im in
Give me my medicine, give me my medicine
Give me my medicine, give me my medicine

yeah, fuck that
look, the contrast is a pair of lips
swallowin syrup and settin fires to sheriffs whip
fuckin all american terrorist
crushin rapper larynx to feed em a fuckin carrot stick
and me? i just spent a year ferrisin and
and i lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
spit to the lips meet the bottom of a barrel
so that sterile piss flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
narrow, tight line, might impair him
since i made it back to fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
pharoah fuckin pillow tear wearin pack of parasite
threw his own loofa off the roof after paradise
ladidadi back in here to fuck the party up
raiding fridges, tipping over vases with a tommy gun
never dollars, pop would make it rain hockey pucks
60 day chips from fuckin awesome anonymous
call him bloated til he show them that the flow deluxe
off the wall loafers, four loko, and a cobra clutch
vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose his drum
let me hit him, hit it with a stick until the ho was numb
culprit of the potent punch
scolding hot as dunking scrotum in a folgers cup or nevada
driving drunk inside a stolen truck
shitting like his colon bust
belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
supernova, im rollin over the novices
im roamin through the forest and spittin cold as the porridge is
stay gold til the case closed and the story end
post mortem porkin this rap shit and record it
to escort it to the morgue again
lord of lips, bored of this
forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
stormin the gate, whos sure in the base, scorching ladies
fortunately these motherfuckers soarin, torso and face
get at me with savages, have a pack of apache
indian pack of niggas who dont give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
as a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky so see me you cant
like crunchy black cats in a taxi
back like lateral passing
with that motherfucking gladiator manner of rapping
as an addict i let percocets and xannies relax me
fall back if your paddies is maxi
please

I was riding in my chariot, with this freak named Harriet
She said my stick was ???, so she knew just where to bury it
This girl named Sequoia, she was from Illinois-a
I had to stuff her mouth with her teddy bear, 'cause she made hella noise-a
This freak named Nikita Brown, I rode her like a merry-go-round
She got to telling all her friends, that it's a new king in town
I was on my way to Las Vegas when I bumped into Tessy
She said her nickname was Marvin, 'cause when she had sex it got messy
This freak named Jenny Marquais, so you know I called her Butter
'cause when it came to summer sundresses, she had ass like no other
The steak was always smothered, she was a freak under the covers
You should have seen my expression, lil' pimpin,
when I got hit on by her mother
This young lady named Chanelle, she was fine as hell
But she was 26, and her son was already twelve
I was at this little assembly, when I chopped it up with Kimberly
Hit it, split it, man that freak said she'd love me for infinity
You should have seen the chemistry, I changed that freak's identity
Seen her at the movies with her man, and the bitch didn't wanna remember me
This girl named Chamere, she put diamonds in my ears
But she also tried to put these niggas on me when I slapped her at the pier
This girl named Cheryl Lynn, she had hella friends
So when I brought my friends and all her friends,
then that's when the party began
This girl named Savannah, she used to love to pout
But I used to say "Don't even trip, just stick this in your mouth"
This freak named Miranda, she thought I couldn't stand her
But yeah, I can stand ya, since I got your ass on camera
I was riding hard, like Humphrey Bogart, with this freak named Leah
Even though she was in the dark, no one could see her, get it?
This freak named Raquela, she worked at Pac Bell-a
She gave me the number to the pager, home, and cellular
She had a lovely smell-a, ass like ???
I was wet like a scuba diver from the sex, homeboy let me tell ya
Chrysler ???, with this chick named Darren
I was at the mall trying to buy some clothes, and she just kept on starin
And then came the flarin, she said she hated sharin
I said "I'm not your man, little freak, so I'm not really carin"
This gangsta's name was Dallion, she wore gold medallions
Every other month we'd take a flight, out to Staten Island
She kept a 9 on the dresser 'cause she had dreams of hell
Even though we in the penthouse suite of a 5-star hotel
I rock and I rock well, that's what I told Gail
She's a conceited little fraternity freak, up there at Yale
Young tender named Divine, I bump in her Alpine
She was the type that looked so good, it was a motherfuckin crime
Took her from behind, led her to the ride
Baby didn't make it home till the sun was 'bout to rise
Kickin in with Corvette, baby had a Corvette
She used to come and get young Nickatina from off of the set
We strikes to the checks, she pick up her Lex
We hit Hotel Nico, you know what came next
I was payin my bill for cable, when I met up with Sable
Green eyes, it was a CEO, of a record label
But I didn't get to hit it, because I met with Bridget
She was Sable's secretary, that gave me head and digits
In the parking lot of a club one night, I ran into Kirby
Freak worked at a beauty shop, said some gangsta's tryin to serve me
Freak you ain't worthy, your gossip column is through
And if some cats is after me, I'm right here mackin on you
Had to pop the collar on my coat, rev up the vogue smoke
Looked her in the eyes and said "Yeah bitch, you're broke!"
This girl named ???, Lord she was dreamy
Met her at a pool party, should have seen her bikini
This lady's name was Val, her husband was my pal
She offered me to put in why he stressed the ?rikers out?
Gave the freak a smile, said "It ain't my style"
I've known the homie for a while yo, and that would be foul
Fired up the weed, me and Saint Jean
We first had locked eyes yo, when we were thirteen
Kissed at 15, sexed at sixteen
That's why she's with me right now in the Beam, Tiga!

The Instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs
Be some brothers from the east with some beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets
Gun control means using both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'
Migrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments
Of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable,
Man every word I say should be a hip hop quotable.
I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses
I'm sick of talkin' about blunts,
Sick of Versace glasses,
Sick of slang,
Sick of half-ass awards shows,
Sick of name brand clothes.
Sick of R&B; bitches over bullshit tracks,
Cocaine and crack
Which brings sickness to blacks,
Sick of swoll' head rappers
With their sicker-than raps
Clappers and gats
Makin' the whole sick world collapse
The facts are gettin' sick
Even sicker perhaps
Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse
Man life can get all up in your ass baby you betta work it out
Let me tell you what it's all about
A skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people
Who be wastin' time screaming who they've hated
That's why the Native Tongues have officially been re-instated
(Vibes, vibrations)
Stakes is high
(Higher than high)
You know them stakes is high
(Higher than high)
When we talkin' 'bout the
(Vibes, vibrations)
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
When we dealin' with the
(Vibes, vibrations)
Stakes is high
(Hey yo, what about that love?)
Yo, it's about love for cars, love for funds
Loving to love mad sex, loving to love guns
Love for opposite, love for fame and wealth
Love for the fact of no longer loving yourself, kid
We living in them days of the man-made ways
Where every aspect is vivid,
these brothers no longer talk shit
Hey yo, these niggas live it
'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone
Plug One translating the zone
No offense to a player, but yo, I don't play
And if you take offense, fuck it, got to be that way
J.D. Dove, show your love, what you got to say?
I say G's are making figures at a high regard
And niggas dying for it nowadays ain't odd
Investing in fantasies and not God
Welcome to reality, see times is hard
People try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card
Showing out in videos, saying they cold stars
See, shit like that will make your mama cry
Better watch the way you spend it
'Cause the stakes is high
Y'all know them stakes is high
When we talkin' 'bout the
(Vibes, vibrations)
Stakes is high
I think that smiling in public is against the law
'Cause love don't get you through life no more
It's who you know and "How you, son?"
And how you gettin' in, and who the man holding
Hey yo, and how was the scams and how high
Yo what up, huh? I heard you caught a body
Seem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti
But they ain't organized!
Mixing crimes with life enzymes
Taking the big scout route
And niggas know doubt better
Than they know their daughters
And their sons
(Oh boy)
Yo, people go through pain and still don't gain
Positive contact just like my main man
Who got others cleaning up his physical influence
His mind got congested
He got the nine and blew it
Neighborhoods are now hoods cause nobody's neighbors
Just animals surviving with that animal behavior
Under I who be rhyming from dark to light sky
Experiments when needles and skin connect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
When them stakes is high you damn sure try to do
Anything to get the piece of the pie
Electrify
Even die for the cash
But at last I be out even though you wantin' more
This issue is closed like an elevator door
But soon re-opened once we get to the next floor where the
(Vibes, vibrations)
Stakes is high
Y'all know them stakes is high
When we talkin' 'bout the
(Vibes, vibrations)
Stakes is high
Stakes is high, come on

You know what baby
I need to tell you something, and
It's something very important you know
I want you to take this timeout, and just listen, very close
You hear me, listen
Can I have you for a minute
Don' get shy 'cause my heart's in it when I say,
"You got me stung out"
I don't know and I can't call it,
But whatever it is you got it, nothing without a doubt (yeah)
Never been the one to cling, and I don' like to be needed
But now, I guess that's all changed
That's why I get mad at your folks, 'cause I don't want you to go
(No babe I want you to stay)
You can say I'm trippin'
But I'm stingy and I can't hide it (I just want to keep you)
Wanna keep you all to me, I'm selfish way try to fight it
(Baby you're the only one) You're the only one
With the only love that's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy but how can you blame me?
Baby tell me how you do it 'cause you got me so into it
I'm gone but I don't understand
So amazing, captivating, elevating, anyway you try to put it
I want to be your man! (so if you)
If you, I don't mind, it's alright, I'm for it, I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on more than being with you
You can say I'm trippin'
But I'm stingy and I can't hide it (I just want to keep you)
Wanna keep you all to me, I'm selfish way try to fight it
(Baby you're the only one) You're the only one
With the only love that's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy but how can you blame me?
Do what you want
Anything, anything I will belong to you (oh anything I'm all yours)
You can do no wrong
Everything, everything I do it because I'm so wide open
No joking you got me right where you want me to be.
I just hope you feel the same
'Cause I don't want nothing to change this is where I want to be.
So if you want to put me on
I don't mind, it's alright, I'm for it, I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on better than being with you
Baby I'm not tripping
You can say I'm trippin'
But I'm stingy and I can't hide it (I just want to keep you)
Wanna keep you all to me, I'm selfish way try to fight it
(Baby you're the only one) You're the only one
With the only love that's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy but how can you blame me?
You can say I'm trippin'
But I'm stingy and I can't hide it (I just want to keep you)
Wanna keep you all to me, I'm selfish way try to fight it
(Baby you're the only one) You're the only one
With the only love that's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy but how can you blame me?

Come here shorty, hey
Girl you're lookin' fine
I heard your searchin' for a real love
And I'm really Ginuwine
I come to move your body, hey
Keep it jumpin' like a party, hey
Come on everybody
Were gonna do it my way
[Chorus]
It's a G thing, hey
Came to party till the break of dawn
Watch my speakers bang
Until daylight comes and we want to go home
I like me a buzz hey, hey
But I don't want to smoke a weed
Why smoke a box of Philly Plums
When she can get high on G
Go pick up a girlfriend
They can ride in my Benz
Cause I'm taking everybody
Where G likes to party
[Chorus]

Boys out pushin' vin
Friday night intimacy
Going out the family boar
Another dead through this door, listen
Yo yo from the CIA, they're going
Yo yo what an artist said, they're going
Yo yo yo!
Yo yo yo!
Brad's off twisting a win
And I can't afford to pay the feds
And now I'm never late on Friday night
By a transit cop looking to fight, he said
Yo yo from the CIA, and I'm
Yo yo what an artist said, they're going
Yo yo yo!
Yo yo yo!
Don't hit fudging I'm
Fucking stupid roll up fight
Now I'd rather jump than pay
But they're gonna' book me anyway

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up

Into the war of the worlds, where cities twirl
L.I.F.E. Long shakin planets for the ?
? lands when I spit out and hurl words
It's a Stronghold writer's guild, Cannibal Ox take over your herd
We planted our flags on your soils
Despoiling opponents with turmoil
? couldn't be aluminum foil
We potent with rounds lit out similar to ?
I was there when it all first sparked
Jersey next to poisonous darts
Camouflaged with the dark, to blend in with the scenery
Snatch your whole team's referee machinery
Before knowin I landmine spot blowing
Throwing heads off tracks, smackin em with an open palm
BITCH SLAP
Make your whole body feel it when I spray
The battle's just begun, it gets deeper as the song plays
Mega with his arms folded
Fists balled up
Toast (?) on the side of my waist
V on the buckle of the belt
Rappin' hell (?)
Cape flowin
Still standin
With two cannons
1 3 2 got me vanished
Ninja in the night with the phantoms
Amped up, set off hoppers (?)
See rays blast from the optics
Livin in fucked up ghetto economics
Spit from the voicebox, nasty with sonics
Animals released out of boxes
Plus we got that Stronghold on the throat
That'll leave you all gone on the float
Split belly cos you off the boat
The battle for Asgard and we fight as gods
Shatter your glass cage into a thousand crystal shards
I stayed in the basement, like the Kreuger Kid (?)
Shut the city down like Baghdad Lubavich (?)
Your stupid clique wrestle warlocks
The audience backed you
I drank eight ounces of water
With my time capsule
Wrote rhymes with father time on mother nature's fabric
A hard rock, I descended from stone tablets
Juggle the bones and poems, of my deceased foes
Who couldn't bounce from spot to spot like Greek toes (?) (so?)
Allow me to surf on your brain waves with jet skis
Unless you want your wrists to part like the red sea
On the roof of hell, you got stomped by angel's feet
Cause you can't be down, you had gravity deficiency
(We spit thoughts!)
I translate harpoons to sharp death
When the point is made, from my underwater breath
Don't get walls confused with linoleum
And try to cut my square like a scared custodian (know me son!)
Every bite upon, I told you not to get it on
But you still trick the hoes with a broken magic wand
Strong Atoms, whole family dear
To duplicate & recreate could take a light year
Squeeze your head into a sneaker, lace your face
Throw you in a black hole, make you swim through space
We mind-bogglin, spine-tinglin
Got the scroll of Galactus now I'm planet-swallowin
Megala's got the surfboard and he's hollerin
All arch-enemies must die
And I know you not unbreakable son, that's a lie
And you can't have my 3.14, that's my pi... (stupid!)
I'm a diamond in the rough, and you're lucy in the sky with a cubit
Your raps don't do it
I deal with cloud literature
Plus my real name is closer to Thor's than yours
Where we practice there is no floor
This is the battle for Asgard (say no more)
Atoms fam & Stronghold, nuclear clamp the mic
And you and your best friend don't even sound tight
I guess something ain't right
We like constellations when they close in
The lost sons of Odin
With a mouthful of parables to get em open
But the psionic imagery'll leave em frozen
I used to outdo cats like you in my lunch period
Then conversate with the burning bush about a period
And bust through your ego like the hymen line of scrimmage
life's the goal, your warning comes in 2 minutes

[CJ]
Yo Eve, where you at man
I'm tires of talkin' to this answering machine shit
I seen you earlier
but you know you was with them Ruff Ryder niggas
I ain't really fucking with it like that shit
[Eve]
Yo, yo nigga if you shy move on
Only room for a thug that can hold on
Keep me right in the night, early in the morn
I need a dog that can buy it if the pressure's on
Damn I hate it when I find out that you niggas soft
Go run and hide for cover when the trouble starts
I like it when he stay and play his part
Ain't scared to put a slug through a nigga's heart
Takes the best of both worlds don't discriminate
East coast, West Coast I don't player hate
Platinum Dayton on the 6-4 regulator
Big trucks in the hood, black Navigator
If you icy with the price, bring me that ring pa
Might entice me to play nicely and come and get'cha
You got a wifey, tell her nicely I'm in the picture
Cause I ain't gon struggle for long and try to get'cha
[Chorus: CJ]
Come on Eve why you talking crazy and all stuck up
Why you stay trying to play me like yo ass is tough one
My own fucking money ain't good enough
You got a nigga so sick I'm bout to throw the fuck up
But I love ya (come on ma) I need ya (understand ma) I got to have ya
Eve, Eve I'd do anything to keep ya
[Eve]
Yo, thinking you fly on ya next tell cell, with accumulated jewels
Smelling like you on doche, nigga you well
Heard you ain't ready to share
How can I live with you? Icy huh?
Me standin' next to you bare, I heard your pockets knotted
But me I'm scheming on the cottage
And you a nigga to turn his back on a bitch
Like I ain't got it and forget that
Bratty type spoiled by the best black Caddy escalated '99 edition get that
And what you ain't equal to a shwang and I ain't with that
Not impressed by all of this is mine but we can split that
Give me all of it homebody this ain't no Kit Kat
Start me off with time couple weeks and I could flip that
What's this 50/50?
You ain't breakin' off none, ya stash is limited
I see it insufficient funds
Mad cause I don't speak but why should you disrespect
So until ya pockets swells speak to the back of my neck
[Chorus: CJ]
[Eve]
Yo, yo blonde hair must be an aphrodisiac for cats
Want me, dick's be harder then aluminum bat's
Flaunt me, I don't hang around with average cats
With average whips, that spend average stacks
I'm into anything but normal things
Celly rings from the broker at the stock exchange I'm hearing that
Glacier filled chains all the haters starin' at me
Make sure I stay nice keep ya bitches glaring at
Wave ya Rollies in the air, yea last year
Now I'm searching for the platinum iced out Cartier
Laid up in da cuts in silk Dolce underwear
Yeah baby spend that that's all I'm trying to hear
It's funny how I used to want the richest niggas
Keep five on deck to see who get the quickest figures
Cause I only want the pick of the litter for this one
And now because my papers got bigger you gets none
[Chorus: x2]

Southern nights are sippin on Henny
Southern nights are rolling up that good
Southern nights are hot sticky and muggy
Doublewide tucked in the woods
Southern nights are pitchforks and gravel
Southern nights are shooting cans of beer
Southern nights are chasing them donkies
Bitch why don't you and your girl get over here
The Southern moon exposes killers
The Southern moon is hot like fire
The Southern moon it knows our weakness
Trips you up like chicken wire
Southern nights are warm and sticky
Southern nights are swampy and loud
Southern nights are home to the Skarcrow
Posted up under the moon and proud
Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black
Most can't see where we at it's where i'm happy
Southern nights are tipped back on SoCo
Southern nights are flippin off the PoPo
Southern nights are cruising in a big block
Foot to the floor quarter miles in a parking lot
Southern nights are hunting chickens with a spotlight
Southern nights are shooting at a stop sign
Southern nights are trolling in the pitch black
Out on the lake with a six pack laid back
The Southern air stings with mosquitos
The Southern air gets hard to breathe though
Shot gun blasts with crazies chasing
Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black
Most can't see where we at it's where i'm happy
It's where I am one with this land I've become
Take me home take me back it's where I'm happy
Southern nights are going to the dope house
Southern nights are gotta take the short route
Southern nights are chasing that rabbit
Blows to the nose cuz you know you gotta have it
Southern nights are your bitch giving you skins
Southern nights are your finger in her best friend
Southern nights are getting head on a dirt road
If she ain't down she can walk her ass home
The Southern mud will tap your luck
The Southern mud will trap you shut
The Southern mud will snatch you up
Some say that's why it's red like blood
Southern nights are drunk in the Waffle House
Southern nights are fucked up so we wild and loud
Southern nights are sun up when we get up
Take your ass to sleep cuz we gotta do it all again
Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black
Most can't see where we at it's where i'm happy
It's where I am one with this land I've become
Take me home take me back it's where I'm happy
Knee deep in the swamps far from any others it's where i'm happy
Underneath the trees where the green roof covers it's where I'm happy
Where it gets so dark you don't know if you're still alive it's where I'm Happy
Please let me die under dark southern skies it's where I'm happy

Yeah . . . Word up
CHORUS: [AZ]
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die (Word Up)
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame (Yeah...How we livin'?)
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
AZ {Verse One}
Dreams fulfilled, gave us more room to build
Strong climb made more time for wounds to heal
I can see the sun, must've been blessed to be the one
Set free to run, same baby moms, new seed to come
Breathin' lungs, through the sonogram see the thumb
So regardless, male or female, love either one
G's and tons branched out, coped the ranch house
In ?Grand Martin? needed some space to plot my plans out
Speak of life, still rock low, plus the sneaker type
Be for ?kites? pushin' a stick make you breeze through life
See through sites, gun shots, used to run spots
Slung rocks, nearly got rich off of one block
Saw the light, caught a case, couldn't afford to fight
Lawyer white, had to cop out or face more than life
Poison bites, my brain, flyin' high flames
Tryin' to change, trapped between worlds kinda strange
CHORUS: [AZ]
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie (Yeah)
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame (Yeah)
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name (That's how we
come at 'em)
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die (Yeah)
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame (Uh Huh)
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
AZ {Verse Two}
Yo it's either or, used to by girl ?Lee Rahol?
G's galore, ?Cristen D or?, devils believe in war
Need some more currency, streets observin' me
Third defree, tryin' to see billions before they murder me
Thoroughly thoughts react, let the ?Porsche? mack accross tracks
Catch me in Haiti, ridin' horse back
Seek religion, study life, tryin' to see the vision
Weeks in prison'll help a wise man peep his livin'
Reach decisions, analyze, scope the game, wit hopes to change
Before the stress overdose the brain, most remain
Shockwaves, I rock stage through the Tropic Haze
Under Palm Trees, puffin' lye for days, liver ways
Cold chillin', old villan, known for buildin'
Sittin' back, controlin' millions
What's right or wrong? Shorter days, nights is long
Keep ya cipher strong, in case, it might be on
CHORUS: [AZ]
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie (Yo)
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die (Each gotta die)
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
AZ {Verse Three}
So what's the remedy, from bein' invaded by your enemy
Envy me, had a cold heart since infancy
Below freezin', used to flip for no reason
Now beyond that, learned to relax, master slow breathin', blowin'
hundreds
Spendin' paper's so redundant
I'm from it, most large niggas over and done wit
No one to run wit, just a few from the Old School
Ocean cruise, lain' back soakin' the blues
Scopin' the views, never once, open the news
It's all stress, placed on the broke and confused
So know the game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
CHORUS: [AZ]
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name
Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name

Buy what we want, spend what they want,
Young, rich, hot nigga, everything she wants!
Triple beams scales got me under deep spells,
Kiss my forehead, momma knows I mean well,
Cocaine bought me everything I ever had,
And I ain't neva' been scared that's been my very last,
Cause I can get it back,
Watch me get it back,
Last 2 of 10 bricks, shit I'm cookin' that.

The million in the ceiling is for a rainy day,
I cut it than whip her like she Annie Mae,
Praise God I escaped by his amazin' grace,
Nah neva' was I savin' Face,
Some family ties aren't possible to break,
The almighty judge only he can save me,
Don't cry for us now just pray for our babies,
Mercedes 5 with the open roof,
Miami hot rods and the ocean view,
The tell tale signs that expose the truth,
Lil' Willy Rat King this one's for you.

Ye ain't seen paper like this nigga.
We get it in a flash like paparazzi,
Cars, crib, everything big body,
Big charm, hangin' from my big chain,
Swing side to side feelin' like I'm T-Pain,
Pull up to the crib bitch think she seein' thangs,
Make a hundred stacks blow it like it's pocket change.
If the good die young,
Than the greats go to jail,
I miss my Tony hope you snitches burn in hell,
Kiss and tell with sales on us ballers,
All because them two doors comin' with big spoilers,
All because them bitches is actin' like they jaw-less,
And we don't count money we way it like fish orders.

I was born black, I live black,
and I'ma die probably because I'm black
because some cracker that knows I'm black
better than you nigga, is probably gonna put
a bullet in the back of my head!!
Yeah our lives fucked up, no doubt
All this shit we go through every day
Sometimes a nigga don't know what the fuck to do
But see I got my niggas
And we gon organize a people army
And we gon get control over our own lives
And I mean that shit right there from the bottom of my shit
I Ching
[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war
Could you take the life of somebody you know,
or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died, when they registered
[Verse 2]
Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me want to break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'ma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes the peoples army stick togehther like glue
We represent the I-Ching, and to this we stand true
Military formation, anyone participation is welcome
Each one teach one, son help son
Just one gun is all it take to get it started
Livin in the wilderness of the west we cold hearted
HOOK 2X:
If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclsym, niggas be like fuck the system
I don't want to be no movie star
I don't want to drive no fancy car
I just want to be free, to live my life, to live my own life
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is
Crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
'cause a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lotta niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, tryin to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the comin years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring though
I'd go against a tank wit a shank for my dreams
And that's my fuckin word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hangin on the curb
HOOK 2X
(next part of hook)
HOOK

"Yeah, one, two
One, two
Where you at?
Where you goin' to?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' be about it?
Project Blowed, Abstract, Fat Jack, Aceyalone
Ladies and gentlemen, good people
Yeah, good brothers good sisters on deck
Dig this, peep the twist
Hand over fist, handstand on the cliff
Layin' stiff, expand on the gift
Uplift the masses, and pass me the spliff
It's a love thang, it's a hate thang
It's a great thang, Cali, to the state of mang
It's a world thing, and I'm a soldier
Always a war goin' on, it's never over
I make music, for the people
Who try to live a good life and keep it peaceful
And be resourceful, and keep achievin'
Every season, we represent the reason
I'm from the fellowship, I'm from the projects
I tell all access is the object
It's to beautiful, it's so painful
I do the work, and don't forget where I came from

I never had real friends 'til now
I never had to steal endz, 'cause that's foul
I walk the streets with the baseball bat feelin' secure
But I try not to incite fights that's immature
Actions that come back to haunt
I work hard to get the things that I want, and never flaunt
Never post where the most guys post high
I keep my focus towards the ground, and pound
Any brother who's my ace to my face
Even if snakes on the unda', I try not to wonda'
Trainin' my brain wit' mental anguish
Strange, it's rather eerie, clearly just a whim
I adjust the hymn
Deal with the dealers and the squealers and the jockeys
I can take the fizz out the carbonated copy
Imprints are made in the sand as I walk
Dim hints reveal rather grand as I talk
Small individuals seem larger
When they take charge of their antics
Makin' them gigantic
So you never suspect their neck bein' strained
So many situated thoughts in the brain
Heavy weight gain, so I weight train
'Cause to me the weight gain is a great gain
And I hate sane individuals
Close they nose to new aromas
I got the smellin' salts that are prone ta'
Clear the nasal, daze
You'll probably make a raise to a new level
And see the true devil
Any color ya wish because the devil takes any shape
Any form, any swarm
Ride over your dish like a picnic
I think the sick shit, I had my wrist slit
Like a suicide, but I survived and you can too
Plan to live a full life free of anxieties
While you're at it try to keep an eye on me
The man with meditation skills wastin' spills
Lyrical liquid, fillin' streams wit' dreams
And I will cream whoever seems wicked
Oral floral arrangements is strange since
You don't have the comprehension
I will stop and lynch them
I'm not the one promotin' gun totin'
'Cause I contain within my brain these computations
Just as potent
The mental torturer, of course
You will acknowledge me
'Cause Mr. Twister places pictures
Mental fixtures of photography
Shitty little bitties never get their clitties done
But I don't think they'll resist
Mr. Twister when I flex my verbal techs
Exit mental anorexic
I don't cater to the imbecile, so you can bet this
Is a brain buster, pain thruster, strain twister
Overwhelming pressure between the temples
When I touch the microphone, I might condone
The usage of abuse if it is convenient
I slant and lean it
Like a lever when I leave ya mutilated
By my enuciated cleaver
I survived the ither and the either
Now let me take a breather
From my own little world, little girls, little boys
Stay free of hurries, free of worries
That's riddle poised for posterity
Where are we, goin' from here
As a ho, and I don't know
And that's the biggest fear
When I'm flippin' into darkness
Now I'm askin' can I spark this?
It's D E L, y'all
From Hieroglyphics y'all
Sayin' peace

I got a brand new car
I got a jazz guitar
Welcome, everybody
Thank you a lot for coming, it means a lot to me
Steady out with my knee, plenty of botany
Damn, bad chick on top of me, pornography
And I know she only want me for my guapary
(Ahem... let me get my voice right
Gary, sorry, 1, 2, 3, 4)
It's the first time ever
Yo fuck this jacket, I turn this shit to 85 napkins
Since Jeter's done I'm now the captain
Trust you me, Gotham's safer now
But there's always a new joker in town
Ready to smoke you with that pound
But when he shoots it, the flag says "BANG!" and everybody laughs
He must be up and off the molly tab
I'm by the bar lookin' Swedish in the trench coat stupid
The only one drinkin' mango lassi in the bullpen
My lips are sealed like the singer with bad skin
My need for speed made the Jag spin
Dog, I'll resurrect Freaky Tah to do my ad-libs
Overseas I prolly got mad kids
That I don't even know about, you better slow down, baby
I'm still young, fuck it, gotta use it while it works
Nothin' lasts forever, or does it? Fuck it
Shout out to my cousins, all of 'em
I got a brand new car
I got a jazz guitar
I'll take it back to playin' handball and smokin' on the park benches
Dippin' cabs and hoppin' fences
Laughin' all the way back to the buildin' runnin'
Got to the door, twist the key, elevator waitin' for me
100, got upstairs and fixed eleven bowls of Crispix
Grabbed a Snapple out the bin, no one's an even match for the kid
Legs are made of stone, the back of a bridge
In goal line situations I'll tackle The Fridge
Peace to Mike Ditka, 50 on the light fixture
Right side shifter, fight fixer, twist your sister
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hair band, mothafucka
It's Bam Bam doin' ah ah ah ah
Out with the, ah!
I can't even get this fuckin' right, are you kidding me?
I'm ashamed of myself, I'm sorry

Blessed be the name of the Lord
He is worthy to be praised and adored
So we lift up holy hands in one accord
Singing blessed be the name

It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank of America
I'm with my son cashing a check, so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world or fly, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, momma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever starts
So I zoomed off thinkin' bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin' off, tryin' to dunk, tryin' to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin' with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place like a child
Don't worry be happy and smile
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away

arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
this rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous
well up until now your only concept of rhythm is a four by four loop
square as a pool table
with no dynamics implanted but you couldn't understand
why all of your gigantic rap sounded so bland
but the answer was right in your hand
couldn't believe you were so naive to
arrangements changes different time signatures
the freedom of your imagination that must have been a fixation with blocks
like tryin to make a wheel out of rock
like tryin to make a puppet out of sock
see i got that private stock the personal vat with the broth and gravy
and the electrons to pass on so the world don't seem so wavy
oh everybody hollerin save me save yourself before it's too late into the
when you go because my wig got weight i gotta concentrate on

arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
this rhythm is sick this rhythm is outta control
yeah now everybody in here check your head and make sure that it's spacious
and open up the middle just a millimeter more for the style that is bodacious
you really want to know who the Ace is
Ace is the face that's seldom sighted

arhythamaticulas arhythamatic

now the problem with you MC's today is you're too emotional
you have no devotion to the social bug spread
by the words you said to the public
you have no regard for the masses how you effect them
and how they view you
now you know you knew you were open wide for the
whole wide world to do you
now i propose those who chose their flows
irresponsible and irrationally
be exhausted from the face of the earth and be forced to deal w/me
me i'd rather be undefined not underestimated or undermined
i'm underlined as the underdog under the influence of time
now i know you're sick of that same old same old
lame old running man dance style
niggas screamin' and yellin' and tellin' lies about what they do
brother I say to you but don't you believe or be deceived
by the hip hop that you breath
i am multidirectional i move randomly and professional
intellectual with perpetual
first in motion bustin' you open
now you are exposed to the rap and closed in the mind trap i find that
hilarious and mysterious every area gets a dose
full of malaria and asbestos from the west coast
breath in and coat your lungs

Yes sir is Bobby Ray, aka A. B.O.B. (O)
I can't be eco conscious, I'm always burning trees
And is there fire, fire, call it that third degree,
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya
Hell yeah you heard of me it's quite a emergency
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah
Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O.
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this is what I caught girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that must reveal
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, man
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher
Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir
Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors
And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over
Had to plug the headset into her motorola
This bout to get scary like the end of October
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the fryin pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
So cold like a hobo wearing no clothes and it's snow globe when the temperature is below froze
I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league
My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep
If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink
If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius,
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya,
So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang ya'll out like portraits
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I got that fire man, and other shit is so so
And this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow
I'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold

'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
The high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
They can't catch me they're never gonna find me
They're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter
Pulled over to the river, to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers pulled a bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing 'cross the country listenin' to my 8-track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
I'm long-distance from my girl and I'm talking on my cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were
Check the rear view mirror check the gold tooth display
Check out the odometer and I was on my way
'Cause I'm the high plains drifter the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me 'cause you could be gettin' mushed
I'm doing a hundred and twenty plowin' over mailboxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
I'ma kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter
Cash flow gettin' low so I had to pull a job
I Found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left the car outside and the engine still revving
Takin' care of business at 7-eleven
I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price
So I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice
'Cause I mellow like Jell-O cool like lemonade
I made my get a way and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a Former movie star
Looked in the rear view mirror seen the police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window and said Boy, where's the fire?
You got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
"Outta the car longhair!" Your goose is cooked
Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked
Making like a DT, driving a grand fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog has his day mine will be in front of a jury
High plains drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3 day old beer
My man turned to me and said, "Why are you here?"
I said I'm charming I'm dashing I'm rental-car bashing
I'm phony-paper passing at Nick's Check and Cashing
I went before the judge he sent my to the Brooklyn house of D.
He said, "You behave or we'll throw away the key"
Houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee
I took the Bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling easy come easy go
I bet on one horse to win and another and so
And sure enough, that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot wired hot wheeled and, "Suzy is a headbanger"

[Verse 1]
Just the other day when I was out at the store
Saw a preacher hella creepin', trying to bang on a ho
That same motherf*cker used to bang on my door
Hollering 'bout donations for cause cuz collections is low
Damn shame, but I got change, so I give to the plate
He know I know he buying pussy, he don't lie to my face
Said that I should cut my grass cuz I'm surrounded by snakes
Not sure if that was metaphoric or if he had seen one today
I know what he said but maybe I beg to differ
The only souls you like to touch were the legs of strippers
The only reason I know that cuz I used to tip 'em
How could I judge when in this world we both some n*ggas
And we both some killers, and we both some thieves
Only God can save us all what he spoke to me
What he hoped to be was a better man in due time
But he fell short tryna sip on the wine
[Hook]
In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your Rolls you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
Which flavors of life's labor have you had?
In the neighborhood package store
Don't need directions for the gun shop, it's on the same block
Of the neighborhood package store
[Verse 2]
Click clack 'gainst my head went the Glock
From a hoodlum on the block
Whispered to me "What you got?
You'll get shot if you refuse to come up off that
What made you floss that outside the package store?
You know we out here like wolves searching for antelope
Lambs, and sheep, prey on weak
Don't you reach under your seat, I'll bust your head like cantaloupe"
Then I replied "Out for a night cap
Didn't bring my tool with me cause I assumed that I'd be right back
Shawty said the neighborhood was cool and it wasn't like that
But here you are with a loaded gun and I'll be damned
if I'm gon' fight back"
So he went on to loosen up on the aggression
And proceed to lecture me on the troubles of recession
And ain't that many jobs outchea hiring convicted felons
So instead of buying what he want, he taking what they selling
Then billing it to the (?), forever on the grind
Addicted to the feeling of wine
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Gripping Golden Grain, flying like Thunderbirds
Easy, Jesus, watch your Crown while I swang and swerve
Molotov bottle, alcohol, not a Tylenol
Could remove the kind of headache that a fight'll cause in the streets
Don Julio my peeps
Cuervo, texting hoes, Captain Morgan with my feet
Standing tall on 'em, 'til I rendezvous with Grey Goose
Cool gray, salty taste, almost threw up on my shoes
Hypnotic blues, Bloody Mary red
Codeine purple seem to take me to the edge
One more shot all I need just to hit the ledge
Toss and turn, crash and burn, just to crawl up in my bed
Go into my head, seeing circles lately
Tasting cream daily, I don't mean Bailey
Vodka tried to kill me, but Seagram Gin saved me
Been a customer so why they play me
[Hook]

Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces (uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up, (mmm) none kept up (mmm)
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society (what)
So how we livin'
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Gibbons?
Not to offend
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em)
Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover
Sellin' drugs to one another
Cause all the glamor you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison
Destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay
No sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of
Another victory
When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it)
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand
The first thing they say is "Where'd you steal her?"
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh
Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me
My name ain't Kieth, so could you please stop Sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period)
Out of order, conquer and slaughter
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when you're ready for business
Cause aaaaah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready)
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?
Another victory
MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day, I heard a brother say
"Taxi cabs don't even come my way
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop, the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money up-front
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)
Hey, even my man L.L. Cool J
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD
Public Enemy and (BDP)
Salt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever never
Whether, whatever, we better stand together
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another cause separation is a flaw
So endure for more and stop lookin' for
Another victory

[ VERSE 1 ]
Excuse me, baby, haven't I seen you before?
I don't forget faces, and I'm pretty sure
That I know you from a long time ago
I was in the 12th grade, you were a grade below
I used to see you in the halls, goin to class
And when you saw me pass, you switched that as-
tronomical butt from the left to the right
And you would give me letters sayin (call me tonight)
Now your face was pretty, and your body was hot
So then I thought to myself, and said, why not?
You can be the skeezer, I'll be the skeezee
I knock the boots, and you're strung on me
But I have to admit, you were a whole lotta woman
You had to be good, cause you kept me comin
Then I graduated, and I left town
That's why you haven't really seen me around
But after all these years, you're still lookin good
And if we got together, I know you would
Reminisce and miss this Def Jef kiss
I respark the flame, and I knew you'd just
want to give it here
Give it here
(Give it to me, give it to me)
[ VERSE 2 ]
I got a fat bank account, I'm pretty comfortable
But hey, I'm very picky bout the girls I pull
Because nowadays you never know
If girls like you, or they like your dough
They always say, "Buy me that", and I say, "Buy you what?
You better keep your mouth shut and do the butt strut"
Cause I'm not spendin a dime until you spend some time
Givin me what I want, cause I'm in my prime
And you know what I want, so don't even play dumb
Girl, give me some, and I can make you come
Back to my house at all times in the mornin
You won't have to say, cause I know what you be wantin
You know the routine, so assume the position
I'ma take my pole, and I'ma cold go fishin
Like a tootsie-pop. you know that I last long
And if you can't sing. you be singin this song
Give it here
(Give it to me)
(Oh)
(Oh, you gotta give me some now)
[ VERSE 3 ]
Because you promised me the day that you quit you boyfriend
You'd let me in, so tell me when
Because you had me waitin and waitin for such a long time
You keep tellin me that it's the wrong time
You're makin it harder and harder
For me to control, and hold back that part of
Me that needs you, and wants to please you
Cause I know what you like, and I'll do more than HE do
So stop trippin, too late to start flippin
Before you start lippin, you need to go slip in-
to the negligé that I got you for your birthday
And don't be scared, cause I came prepared
So if you're old enough to give me shot
And if you're bold enough to take all I got
Don't say that you're ready if you really are not
Cause - mh, when I get hot
I'll give you more than anyone before
I'm not Prince, but I'll do you like you never been done before
Let's get together, I know we fit together
Like a hand and glove, come on and get this love
Just give it here

Da Grym Reefer Verse 1:
It's me Dick Hennessey
The one with the Magnums
Said you can swallow my seeds
But can't plant 'em
I kidnap
Pimp slap
Hoes that spring parent traps
Guess U want me to break bread
With you
Perhaps
Asking me what's the name of our baby to be
If he makes it out this rubber
Name the motherfucker Hercules
You think by running that game
That you'd be hurting me
But that's the reason that you hoes
Get no ove from me.
Up to fuckery
That's why you're suffering
You really hurt the kid
That's why you get nothing from me
Fucking tramp ho
Need to be
On the Maury Show
Either find out who the real daddy is
Or just let it go
I ain't got no time
To be
Spending my lifetime
Trying to support
A bitch
Or a kid
That ain't mines
Can't believe
I'm going through this shit
With a bitch again
Fuck these Magnums
I'm switchin
To Michellin
(Chorus)
I'm working hard trying to get rich (get rich)
But I can't
These bitches all on my dick (all on my dick)
This child support shit
(repeat Chorus)
Denny Lucci:
I done had false alarms
With fake bitches
And I done had lying hoes
That's trying to get me
Pretty smile
Fat ass
And the mind is wicked
Trying to set a nigga up
Just to stack riches
I love kids
It's the momma that's always fucking shit up
Always talking shit
Bitch, get out and ride the bus
I'm tired of hearing ya mouth girl
So shut the fuck up
You don't like my ways then pack ya shit up
Cuz I could give a friendly fuck
About your crying and shit.
Talking bout you pregnant
Quit all that lying and shit
Cuz it ain't funny
Hoes do this shit for money
In the mall wilding out
While you pinching and scrubbing
On the Muary show
Talking all that loud shit
But when the test come back
Who the triffling bitch.
On the Muary show
Talking all that loud shit
But when the test come back
Who the triffling bitch. Ho!
(Chorus x2)
Da Grym Reefer:
Plenty hoes know my name
Many hoes running game
Plenty hoes try to play
Every nigga like the same
With no shame
Whether slick
Whether lame
Either wild
Whether tame
In a niggaz ass
All these hoes a pain
Wanna see a ho go wild
Just give a bitch a child
Watch her run from hot to mild
Like a model
Change her style
Many bitches hate me now
Wearing rubbers is a must
What is Reefer's deepest fear?
Planting seeds inside a slut!
J Slum:
Baby momma
So much drama
Man, you know they with the shit
Getting mad a nigga
Cuz he with another bitch
How the fuck you gone get hot
and start to catch an attitude
Seen Alisha at the mall buying
Cambrion some shoes
You ain't nothing but a snot
And need to get your shit together
Trying to find a ride to club
So you can shake your tail feather
While you constantly getting jealous
Need to have your ass at home
Paying someone else to watch your child
You need to watch your own
(Chorus to fade)

I've gotta see my doctor..Scotty's calling me...
Scotty beam me up
I'm in the zone I wanna fly morning, noon, and night
I'm geeked up [x8]
I'm geeked up and I can't see
And all the walls keep looking at me
I tell myself there's nothing wrong
But I can't stop gritting my teeth
I can't sleep
I can't eat
I just geek
I just geek
And I know I can't take one so why not three shake it deep
I can't help the way I feel
When I geek I keep it real
In the hood I keep my steel
Try to blow my high you will get killed
Cause it's real bankhead real fabo
Broad daylight, don't keep shit low
Roll my blunt right in front of po po
Fuck them hoes the can blame it on the 'dro

I'm in the zone and I bought me a star gack
And I'm really geeked up that's a star fact
I'm starting to see space ships on bankhead
I roll with gangsters pill poppers and dank heads
I got partners like, Worm, Lil' Boom, Buddy And Famous
I got sistas like Yasmine, Chocolate, Porcha, they dangerous
I fly like blaze when I'm burning purp
Real powder heads the burning hurt
Geek music I'm earning turf
While your footballs soft like nerf
I'm in the zone
I've gotta see my doctor...Scotty's calling me...Scotty beam me up
I'm in the zone I wanna fly morning, noon, and night
I'm geeked up [x8]
