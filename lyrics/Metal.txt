Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
Can't bend what's made of metal
We're reinforced with steel
We never will surrender
We never kneel
It's true the sound of metal
Makes us invincible
No trends of fashions change
The way that I feel way that I feel
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are we all are
Sure there's been lots of poseurs
Who've tried to break the chain
The chain that makes us brothers
They've tried but in vain
This thing is my religion
My soul, my blood, my life
I am so fucking metal and so is my wife
I am his wife shut up
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are we all are
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are
Made of metal, made of metal, made of metal
We are

Expansion of the ever increasing universe
Thins down imperfect pictures
And certainty of the tangible existence
Trickles between fingers
Entering the center of the point
Physical reality dies
Giving birth to the new order
Negating all that has ever been said for good
So what are we?
Attracted by the gravity of the black hole
Veiled by the faith in words
Proud of the promised immortality
Hysteria at the moment of sudden illumination
Will ring with countless screams
Uniting in a sneer
Coming from the empty throne

While the minds sway to the unknown
While the fears turn into bravery
Good like evil doesn't mean anything
The awake power has chosen its side
To rise my aura to the other side
To break the cloak of sympathy
To penetrate the secret of the worlds
To recover the sense of existence
To know the spiritual peace
To create light and darkness
To recover the path to Eternity
To brave evil I've done and the one I shall do...
I'm waiting for you, don't straggle on the way
Set me free from this body
Prisoner of matter, slave of rot
I need again my liberty
Planned of the mercy of storms
Thousand freaks stand out against the darkness
They twinkle and dance in space
Hypnotize their victims in ghastly fancies
And take delight on their bad thoughts
Ghastly fancies! Ghastly fancies!
And take delight on their bad thoughts
To rise my aura to the other side
To break the cloak of sympathy
To penetrate the secret of the worlds
To recover the sense of existence
To know the spiritual peace
To create light and darkness
To recover the path to Eternity
To brave evil I've done and the one I shall do,
I shall do in ghastly fancies...

Please love, just come home again
Just let this one pass, there will be another
And this after before the pain
Every deliberate hangs by my left hand
Those eyelids and this warm wated floods my nostrils
Neck deep, I cry high
Together we sleep, slouched discolored porcelain
Dreaming of those elucid moments when smiles hang high
Limbs outstretched, a bad moon rising
Faucet turning
Desolation churning
Drowning in what we've become
Neck deep, I cry high
I have spilled and you cannot fathom the notion that it was the end of something
This is the end

I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Acknowledged beneath the sky
The hate I carried, recalling why!
I walked towards the rising Autumn
And cursed the Summer with the promise of Winter
Where my foes will quiver in frost
A circeling saga, not forever lost
I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Declaring war beneath the sky
The hate I carried, boiling within!
I mounted all the hills my eyes could count
And roved wherever the sun escaped sight
I drifted from the deepest tarn
Til I saw my name in a runic sign
Graven so deep in the crystal bark
Of a lodge I sojourned years ago
Crying my fate beneath the sky!

Take you with my skinning hearth
Strap you in my restraining chair
Clean and hone my instruments
Then the torture will begin
Blood drips off your finger tips
Drool sags down from your chin
Eyes roll back and jowls clench
I vigorously carve and peel your skin
Chunks of skin fly through the air, nauseating pool of piss
And blood evolves beneath the chair
As you struggle to stay alive, I'm overwhelmed by laughter
I split your scalp spreading it apart
Pull your face below your neck
From muscle and flesh your skin I've pried
Grizzly apparel fitted to my size
Finger pointing in your blood
Rolling in piles of guts
Polish and buff your skull
Nail your scalp to my wall
Grind your bones into dust
Cannot stop till all is mush
I save tattooed skins
Gallons of blood line the floor

A new day arises
As the city sleeps
No compromising
No promises to keep
We stand on our own again
The rain falls hard
Revealing the memories
Ten years gone
The life we share
Doesn't mean anything
If we don't try to survive
Visions overloading
Pulling me through time
Back to the moment
When I realized
That your demise
Could have been caused by my hand
Been through just about everything
But we're still here
We still have so much to prove
To ourselves
The life we share
Doesn't mean anything
If we don't try to survive
There is so much left for us to do
Will you join me again?
I know I haven't been reliable in the past
You have had a hard time figuring me out
But I can promise you one thing
This journey's taught me to stand strong
Never again will I
Surrender my fears
Surrender my dreams
Surrender my soul
To the infection

Trapped inside your corrupted self
Held down by your withered soul
Go! Wake up the dead
Rise from your graves!
Every second that passes you by
Lost to deterioration
Go! Wake up the dead
Rise from your graves!

Daylight, lie asleep
I conserve desire
As I refuel the fire
Teethbites, in your neck
You become the gravy
Sufficed, money bet
Your last words were, "Save me"
May day, Pay day
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Cannibal
Another door's unlocked again
Easy means
I must disguise myself
To fill my veins
Keep that bloody stake away
Crosses burn my eyes
I plan to live another hundred years
Before I say goodbye
May day, Pay day
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Live human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Cannibal
May day, Pay day
Patiently I wait
Entice with the bait
Women can't resist
Eternal bliss
Stalking, once again
My body needs a refill
Surprise, you are next
The only sound is a shrill
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Cannibal
Live human vulture lives

Your lips are like morphine
And your eyes are deceit
The make-up runs down into
The bullet wound in your cheek
There's a secret I can share now (just don't tell)
And it's all about lust
There's a world I can show now (just don't cry)
A black planet of rust
Will this hand destroy you?
Venus in arms
I'll strip you off
In the flood of the light
Venus in arms
You'll taste the dark
Yet so innocent white
Your tongue taste like strychnine
And your long hair is torn
The fancy wings are broken
And a black star is born
There's a venom can you taste it (let out your tongue)
And it taste sweet (There's a diamond can you see it)
Open your eyes
Black sugar deep in the meat
Will this hand destroy you?
I'll strip you off
In the flood of the light
Venus in arms
You'll taste the dark
Yet so innocent white
And I will suck you
Into the magic turbines of the night
I will lead your to me
And I will tear them down
All the white stars in your eyes
Then I'll bury them deep
They are the victims of the vices
Which I try to project
They are the servants of the crisis
Which I try to project

Confidence blurred by arrogance,
And the self worship continues,
Who is an artist?
You can't decide for yourself,
Straight lines, I see straight lines,
But they control sloppily, stupidly.
Keep that golden, celebrity character to your own conscience
Take a breath and rest your jaw,
A Vertebrae with no spine.
Our entertainment: A mockery
With every laugh and every joke the actor's lungs become more dense with damnation.
Don't mistake my intentions for superiority, let's make that clear.
This isn't right and the worst part is were not pretending.
Don't memorize these names
Eternally.
This world will run dry and well watch the clock,
Well watch what we'll become.
Don't memorize these names,
Eternally.
Take a breath and rest your jaw

Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson 1994
Laughter echoes through the night
the Evening Star shines over Midgard
Evil mingles in the dark
the organized cosmos' enemy comes forth
Loke, the son of Frbaute.. Father of
Lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws
Takk weeps no heavy tears
for the loss of the sun's handsome son
But the mare in the woods submits
for the regaining of Foster brother's
favour
Loke, the son of Frbaute.. Father of
Lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws
The salmon glides in the waterfall
The Eagle sails with wind
Hammer groans in Jotun scull
The underground spurts fire
Laughter, deceit, beauty and contempt
The Old Norse God's protector and leader
of Jotuns
Music: Ivar Bjrnson 1994

Flesh shall flay
Peeled back exposing the nutrients of contents of mammal
Nutritious, delicious fruit
The stratified-squamous keratinized
Epithelia dissected
Pseudo-stratified columnar, uni-cellular goblets (cells) secreting mucus
Gored out
The flesh is ripened ready to gorge
Visceral contents empty on the floor
Like a fine wine the organs disgorge
Victim lies begging but I'm wanting more
The pain is insane, a new anus is torn
Gaping slice
Opened wide, peeling rind bleeding, spurting everywhere
(Now revealing the salty goodness beneath and flash frying it)
Lancing meat
Tender outside juicy inside disgusts me
Chopping, dicing, scrutinizing, dissecting and separating
A corpse is still a corpse, of course we dine with no remorse
We've sharpened all the knives to know the ripe that's beneath the rind
A blood lust curiosity, what makes these humans tick?
I've known it all my life
Blood
Flesh shall flay
Peeled back now exposing the nutrients of contents of mammal
Nutritious, delicious fruit
The stratified-squamous keratinized
Epithelia dissected
Pseudo-stratified columnar, uni-cellular goblets (cells) secreting mucus
Gored out
And like a wild boar your head is hunted
And like a cantelope your head is opened
And like a pork belly your skin seared sterile
And underneath it lie the lies, the murder, the man, the meat

Drool dripping from your chin
Yellow eyes, rotten grin
Home of insects and disease
Rancid excretions, deadly breeze
Open sores, gaping wounds
Smegma, tartar, decayed nose
Fermented fungus, pungent rot
Ripping farts, running snot
Ugliness
Secretions
Oozing, itching puffy spots
Intestinal dribblin's, steaming trots
Growth within your pubic hair
Bug life feels at home in there

Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled and pagan history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast majestic wings
These are the shores whereto my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
Through the whispers of a dream
From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud, audacious King mantled in the
Vehemence of lust
Death and destiny undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
In awe of the glorious battles won, my dark Goddess provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought
I fear the Augean light
Is sweeping through Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem,
Now Autumnal leaves succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
Languid, I wend my path to grave
Cast my sword to the sulphyd grasp
Of the naiad neath the silvered lake
When waters stirred lay silent
Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine, else thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshees song
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon
The haunted shores of Avalon
Bury me in velvet dream
Lest I unduly wake
And seek to reconcile my thirst
With the cowardly tailors of my fate
Unleash mastiffs of snarling night
To overthrow, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return
Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over
Centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the
Passive flocks roam free
This my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul,
Trespassing breeds
I have awoken from the past
Glenfully with the shadows over England's bitter skies
I prize mine wounds in a soil sweated drink
Remember me as king when I cradle hell to stars
Like lovers in my arms, nestled vipers to my breast
Venom forces workthius arts of devil's and priestess
Thus I shall rule anew through the sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me, from death they shall ascend
To whisper weals of war to stir the dark one in men
The principle black metal masterplan

I crack your bones
I fuck your mind
I rip your soul to pieces
And burn your fucking eyes
The end is near my sweet, sweet bride
Exploding anger is bursting inside
No remorse you will die
Filthy messed up my sick fucked up brain
Let me introduce you to pain
Let me introduce you to pain
I wreck your face and crush your skull
No sympathy for your cries
I used to hug and kiss you
Now i'm gonna rape and kill you
I like it when you scream you fucking bitch
You make my dreams come true
Receive my cascade of sick semen
I succeeded to love you in every way
Exploding anger is bursting inside
No remorse you will die
Filthy messed up my sick fucked up brain
Let me introduce you to pain
I crack your bones
I fuck your mind
I rip your soul to pieces
And burn your fucking eyes
The end is near my sweet, sweet bride
Exploding anger is bursting inside
No remorse you will die
Filthy messed up my sick fucked up brain
Let me introduce you to pain
Let me introduce you to pain

Knights of terror and insanity
Ruling peoples destiny
Forced by crippeled history
Don't let it come back again
Fear me - your death
Alive - you see
My killing - you
Is here
Men is here - to death
Women i see - in pain
Children - be killed
By fascist slaves
The killing begins
No reason for it
Revenge for a fucking
Massmurderslave
Lidice - burned down
Racist rage - began
Solution - to start
Dictator's insane
Dealing with pain each day, surrender to their suffering
A brutal sttement of power against a mankind insane the pain
Sad youth - alone
Growing up - right now
No idols - for them
Reflecting on it
Searching for - a meaning
In life - so bad
Lies they hear - about
The fascist regime

I have faith and I will travel
Such sights I never seen
There are wrists that need to be slit
It is the passage to where I've never been
Everyday when I wake up I know I've failed
Something to live for is hard to find
I'd like to think that I know tomorrow
I need to leave it all behind
I'm descending into inferno
And I'm burning in Hell
All earthly crises has left with my own life
Down here I dwell
All my powers go to survival
Don't eat enough to do something else
It's time to quit but time to betray
'Cuz all my head is full of is Hell's bells
I'm descending into inferno
And I'm burning in Hell
All earthly crises has left with my own life
Down here I dwell
I have faith and I will travel
Such sights I never seen
There are wrists that need to be slit
It is the passage to where I've never been
I have faith and I will travel, I have faith and I will travel
I'm descending into inferno
And I'm burning in Hell
All earthly crises has left with my own life
Down here I dwell
I'm descending into inferno
I'm burning in Hell, I'm burning in Hell
Burning in Hell, burning in Hell

Everything comes to an end.
Castrate my tool, store it safely in a jewel case and throw away the key.
Separation has tainted my comely sunny skies.
Regret flows out of these open wounds.
Rain on my parade.
My confidence is soaked.
Laughter has now lost all of its sincerity.
Emptiness persists.
I've never felt this much anger.
A silent nemesis grins.
I've never felt this much anguish.
A pledge to inflict it tenfold.
Shed these butterfly wings.
Regain your larval state.
Converge with every other insect.
Your lips are sown with rusted barbwire.
Swim in guilt to regain my trust.
Stabbed in the back by a bitter secret.
A portrait painted black.
Shed these butterfly wings.
Regain your larval state.
My heart is abandoned on a silver plate.
Her silence is as cold as a lifeless teenage corpse.
Her delicate beauty has lost all of its purity.
Her pale white skin marked by the foul sent of treachery.
Castrate my tool, store it safely in a jewel case and throw away the key.
Separation has tainted my comely sunny skies.
I'll remember this day.

neon light, exciting sight
welcome to the flesh-venal scene

oh my tough leather-queen
I lick your makepeace submissively

sadistic lessons all I need

Hark!
The all prophetic incantation
I was here before the beginning came
And I am the one to come after all myths and gods
Remain I shall beyond the end ov days
I pity Thee not oh self despising slave
Thy self contempt filled with disgust
Cast aside Thy scorn ov the earth
Until I lay my wrath upon Thee I shall...
eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!
lead: Nergal
Lead: Seth
drowned in empty black
Attempt to embrace my universe
I learnt how to crawl through knives and thorns
Drowned in alienation
I drag myself through the mud
Hatred injected, abhorrence accepted
When mankind fall prey
I shall arise!
lead: Nergal
and Great Dragon from my mouth emerged
And all the treasures ov this world belong to me
In the sweetest inorganic embrace ov my devotee
I pledge my dagger unto Thee
blessed with the promethean rain
Tranquility I may find in bottomless pits
I shall carry this darkness on my back
'till the day all the suns eclipse I shall...
eat the weak!
Fuck the flesh!
Slit the throat!
Consume the dead!

Fall to your knees, accomplishing nothing.
Fall to your knees, only to exercise your schedule.
Abandon calendar.
What has come with such preaching is loneliness.
Profit: zero.
Achievement: zero.
Forward can't be stopped.
It just goes to show that some words are useless.
Take all your medals, take all your ribbons,
Take all your awards, take them back to the ground.
Our youth is lost;
A product of the created circumstances.
All I can say is "Maybe."
This is what I've been expecting all along.
Now's the time of weakness, now's the time of blood.
Perhaps even the whole-hearted had wished for this.
Now's the time of weakness, now's the time of blood,
And still the time of lions.
Push everything, force everything.
We've all sung of the end, but who truly understands it?
All along.

Torn from your body,removed while you scream
Dissect to collect, my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display
You mark your skin it, gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied
Crudely I cut away
All are my prey
Tell me how it feels when your flesh is peeled
You are vain with your art
I desire it torn appart
With my insane hunting the removal of flesh now starts
You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
[Solo Jack Owen]
Ignoring your cries
Exposing your insides
Violence defined
Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect, my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display
You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied

Still I yearn to see chaos and calm in harmony
Arcana that lies beyond the dreams of everblazing skies
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander in the mysteries of life
In blood are the murderers hands once again
As I hold you my child for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief , there is no other way
"Thou shalt not hesitate, just let it slip away"
I am the Flaming ember
Flood of neverending pain
Rise my Sons now from the flames
Kill! Kill!
Release Hell...
?
Come new life like old once did
Weed out the weak now from our way
Leave their bodies to be eaten
By the Beasts that haunt the night
Before this earth from dusk was drawn
When gods were sleeping, I was born
Son of Chaos and Mother Whore
Tempter strong yet without form
Through your eyes I see this enraptured disharmony
Arcana that is never solved by the one tangled in dreams
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander and refuse to see the truth
In blood are the murderers hands once again
As I hold you my child for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief there is no other way
Tattoos in my soul displays the Fall of heaven's dome
I am the Flaming ember...

The container of my soul was severed from my shell
At birth I was stigmatized by fires of hell
This hollow space inside is growing still
It's going for the kill
Beneath the blood red sky the song was born
The sky was bleeding when I sang her the deadsong
By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame
She slept under my wing
A cold embrace
Death's loyal servant now filled with pain
Forever haunted by her angelic face
By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame
These chains
Hold me down
Down on this frozen ground
In this world where death walks the earth
The sign of reaper given in birth
By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame

Crawled across this glass, slept on these nails
Dissapointment never fails
These blood shot eyes focus on your flaws
Now reach for the shortest straw
Wide awake these nights, nightmares at ease
Now I become an anomaly
Shortness of breath program destruct
Cotton candy framed a paper cut!
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it back-back where it belongs
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it back-back where it came from
I swear on my mother's eyes
I had nothing to do with your demise
I'm lost without you
So let's propose a toast to the famine ghost
Open empty mouths,all tied in knots
Memories I thought that I forgot
These stomach pains, strain of disease
Can't hear my prayers ignore my pleas
A mothers child, a soldier's guilt
Smell the flowers before they wilt
Send a funeral wreath, a folded flag
A yellow ribbon wrapped around a body bag!
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it back-back where it belongs
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it back-back where it came from
I swear on my mother's eyes
I had nothing to do with your demise
I'm lost without you
So let's propose a toast to the famine ghost
Back and fourth from work 40 hours till home
Everyday the same this haggard life is my own
Hungry mouths need value meals
Super size my future and these 18 wheels
I'm as blue as my collar and this bruise of mine
Hammered down teamster bought box of pine
I swear on my mother's eyes
I had nothing to do with your demise
I'm lost without you
So let's propose a toast to the famine ghost
Pay it back take it back-back where it belongs
Pay it back take it back-back where it came from

Behold
The blade is nice and dull from the millions of heads, from the millions that we left for dead
Bluntly disassembled and painfully dissected
With an instrument of gore, bisected heads like rose pedals litter the floor
Clinically insane serotonin flooding the brain
A sudden charge of epinephrine leaves my victims writhing in pain
In ecstasy I continue to maim no one around me shall remain the same
I can take off their scalp, watch the cranium palpitate, bleeding and throw them away
I decide your fate
I say you're too late
With the judgment stick of hate
I decapitate
With this axe I behead
With this knowledge I've obtained of the human race
I leave you dead
I've stared in the eyes of my helpless casualties
I've yet to experience any kind of human remorse
I stand on the harvest floor
The place where death shows its face
And extinguishes all of the human race
Behold
A blade to crush the skull, the ribcage, break every bone and destroy every membrane
Smite the people with vengeance and bring damnation upon their descendants
Bluntly disassembled and painfully dissected with an assemblage of gore
Bisected heads, appendages, intestines and more
Clinically deranged norepinephrine driving me insane
A sudden charge of adrenaline leaves my victims writhing in pain
In ecstasy I continue to maim everyone now just a pawn in my game
I can remove their faces now displaced in ways that you never thought could happen again
Like the murders of yore
Dearly departed and discarded gore
Forever living in my mind
In axetasy the only peace I can find
I decide your fate
I say you're too late
With the judgment stick of hate
I decapitate
With this axe I behead
With this knowledge I've obtained of the human race
I leave you dead
I've stared in the eyes of my helpless casualties
I've yet to experience any kind of human remorse
I stand on the harvest floor
The place where death shows its face
And extinguishes all of the human race
In axetasy its fight or flight
Euphoria in slice and dice
No better way to spend my nights
In axetasy I end your life

In the kitchen
With a screaming triple amputee...
Its completion depends solely
On my needs...
Said amputee's stumps
Are my way of saying... "Thank you
Just for being you."
Its fear tastes better than its limbs.
Terror of morality
I draw from the slowly dying damned
Monsters live behind my eyes;
I let them out and people die.
And all the grave worms
That come for their piece of meat?
I give them dead things..
The wretched living are mine alone
Fright mounts with the body count
To which anthropomancy predicts a decline
In all of God's creation,
Can there be a lifestyle that's better than this?
I mark my territory
With their blood and excritement
And adipocere...
I can find my way in the dark;
My fulfilment is habitually necromanic
And anal abusive..
Seen through the eyes of a mortician
They've "caught" me, as they call it;
My teeth and my semen have betrayed me..
Nevermore!
Tests to gauge my rationale,
The likes of which these feeble minds have
Never seen.
Rorschach blotters,
My responses to which inspire fear...
From my lizard side,
The amoral alien speaks;
"These aren't butterflies,
I see a face I'd like to burn."
Obfuscation
Of the authorities with lies,
And my natur
Alability to charm and be me,
Or whoever they want;
I've known all minds by divine right.

Festering scabs, papillae and pores
Hardened carbuncles, spots and cold sores
Pick at the scab, septic blood starts to weep
Rip at my face, ruptured growths start to seep
Blackhead and boils, pustular cysts
Chapped commodores, perspiring zits
Pierce the bland, infected tissue starts to bleed
Diseased and plagued, tumors chew and feed
On ulcerated flesh
On facial mess
On blooming sores
On blistering warts
Squeeze out the blood, the pus I extract
A rancid cocktail, steaming and black
Infested skin, bubbles and bursts
Hackney vulgaris, spluttering pus
The swarming mass
With acid I attack
With razors I hack
Buboes, bulging and black
Squeeze out the blood, the pus I extract
A rancid cocktail, steaming and black
Bursting canker, clustered bullae
Pimples and bones eat me alive
Gnawing, curdling, swarming flesh
Bubbling, seething, disgusting mess
Smarting, abased purple and raw
Pustular, vulgar pimples and sores
The juice is squeezed
Sebum bleeds
Lick the pox
Weals and warts
Festering face
Decrepit and plagued

Searching for answers about the meaning of life
I can tell you they're harder than kryptonite
You want to get in touch with your inner self
Destroy your principles, get rid of all your lies
You can take your stuck up pride with you as you fall to die
No heads down when you take the hit
Your life ain't worth shit
Demons from within turn your heart so cold
You have nothing inside that cage you built around you
You can take your stuck up pride with you as you fall to die
No heads down when you take the hit
Your life ain't worth shit
Don't you ever let anybody in?
Totally worthless
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat
Don't you ever let anybody in?

Surgeons implementing superior technology
Using advanced lasing as a circumcising technique
Intense mini-lasers used to remove baby boy's foreskins
An electronic mishap ruins the operation
A power surge causes the laser to castrate
The infant boy's penis is now burnt to ash
Excision of the prepuce by amplified light waves
Only weeks old, the child now emasculated
A horrible malpractice nightmare for the parents
Testicles eliminated to stop testosterone production
Androgen manufacture totally obliterated
The infant will begin its life as a girl
Mass doses of effeminate hormones injected
Estrogen forges distant cells into female working parts
Of a little girl
As the child matures, ladylike nature will be enforced
Raised to be so pretty and feminate
Never at all told she was born a boy
Modern surgery changed the sexes
Between the legs, man-made cunnus
The pseudo-girl has grown, refusing conformity to womankind
Although lacking testes, many thoughts prevail
She finds other women so attractive and alluring
A freak in life, lesbianism becomes her role
The womanly shell holds a screaming man within
Alone she sadly strokes a rubber prong strapped around her waist
So envious of men, endowed with actually fleshly rods
Intense mini-lasers used to remove baby boy's foreskins
An electronic mishap ruins the operation
A power surge causes the laser to castrate
Unknowing she came into the world with a geniune shaft and glans
An actual fleshy rod

All is lost and foreign kings
Rule the northern realms
Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men
Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege
They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed
From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down christians' spines
As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher
The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed
With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high
And before it he swears:
'Allvise Ygg, Maktige Harjafader
Guda av Asars och vaners att
Hor mina ord, nar som jag svar
Att om tusen vintrar ater ta var ratt?
While he speaky his prayer
Mjolner rests in the air
As if holding breath
Frozen by fear
They gathered stand and stare
And what they see is death
A laughing cry fill the shivering night
He lets the hammer strike
A bolt of lightning bright
Rips the darkened sky
Fire of doom, ignite!

in new day dreams a promise gives way
to a star struck death and a gold disease
a hollywood end for a once great man
who found death on his knees
cashed in crashed and burned
sore sour sore
our eagles become our vultures
i've searched with pen and paper
i search to show you
just how far i broke from myself
in the name of fear and doubt
in a better world there would be a better me
without the chase that won't leave me be
wolves at my door keep all your wars
i'm going home to bed
i've paid more death then you will ever live

In peaceful silence she lies there and sleeps
Dreaming of secrets concealed in the deeps
Ohh, of our long forgotten history
Those who are devoted to her know that she keeps
Ohh, in her pure soul the key, ohh, to our identity
I will guard your ancient dreams
Protect my lovely sleeping beauty
I would give my life and love
For my sacred divinity
Now the winter sun paints her in shining gold
Smiling she wakes up and asks me to hold
Ohh, her gentle hand in mine
Her graceful white body trembles in the cold
Ohh, she knows today the forces will align
Ohh, forces hating the divine
I will save you from their blind
And unreflecting treachery
I will guard your soul and life
My sacred divinity
I will always stand by your side
Save you from their tyranny
Or I will die for my love
My sacred divinity
Hear the storm blowing, see the skies darkening
On marketplaces and in churches crowds of them are gathering
Here they come marching, betraying and lying
To take our love and our souls, to destroy everything
They do not care for your soul and your purity
Nothing do they feel for you except of everlasting envy
Neither do they know nor understand your biography
They hate your beauty, hate all beauty and fear your ascendancy
After this cold day of sadness and grief
She is left without any hope or belief
Ohh, in a day after this night
Will she in death find at last a relief?
Ohh, a place of silence and light
Ohh, where everything is alright?
I broke down and cried in sorrow
In despair and misery
I cried for my love and passion
My sacred divinity
All I tried to do was stand there
Helplessly in agony
I watched them dishonoring
My sacred divinity

I'm just trying to uncover the truth
Where's the Captain?
Hold it, Cap'
Consider the helm, the helm.
The captain is in his bunk berth,

Walk away, you mask your face, hide behind your faith, no saints, no saints, just slaves. Just criminals, you're all the same. You're all to blame. And I could strike you down, but I'll just call you out. You preach a truth, a lie, a love so divine, you say we're children of god but you're no son of mine. No you're no son of mine. How can we love with venom running through our blood? How can we be loved for the things that we have done? And when we speak, we speak into tongues. To swallow your speech, is to poison the words in the verses that are sung, and you're wrong, there's shit all written in the stars. Choke on your words, I'd rather sit here and starve. Drink to cure the thirst, die for the cause. You say everything in silence in your pause. Oh, god, isn't the truth raw? Well I'd rather know that then believe love that was so god damn false. heartless fiend you say you love, but true motives speak, so listen to these words while your world decays and you will hear no doubts believe when I say that. We're all slaves living in a brainwashed age, plant in us the lies that you seed, you think you reap what you so? I'll spit it back in your face and watch the shit grow over and over and over we go. over and over and over we go. Cowardice your mark the face of the ignorant you can hide behind the cross ill live for my sins

I'm leaving behind this world
And all the things I am (the things I am)
I'm tearing away from it
Because I know I can
I'm pushing away from you
And all the things you are (the things you are)
Don't need the memory
Already wear the scars
There is no yesterday
Tomorrow's far away
I (I) gave you everything
And in return
You gave me nothing
Show me a sign (sign)
Please give me anything
I will not hide from what's inside of me
My nemesis
I'm turning away from me
And all the things I've known (the things I've known)
I don't need your help no more
I can do this on my own
I'm taking all the blame
Resent what I've become (what I've become)
I regret everything and
There's nowhere left to run
There is no yesterday
Tomorrow's far away
I (I) gave you everything
And in return
You gave me nothing
Show me a sign (sign)
Please give me anything
I will not hide from what's inside of me
My nemesis
I (I) gave you everything
And in return
You gave me nothing
Show me a sign (sign)
Please give me anything
I will not hide from what's inside of me
My nemesis

The autumn leaves are gently dancing
Upon the soil in which i lie
My place of rest for the living hidden
Far away from their prying eyes
Summoned by the monn ascending
Toward the surfice i slowly rise
To once again stroll the path of darkness
Crimson coloured it before me lies
I won't brake the masquerade
As i stalk my pray at night
Death comes swift and silent my dear
You won't feel the bite
And when the morning finally comes
Draind from blood you will be found
A withered flower in an alleyway
Under a shroud of frost, blaek and pale
In my tomb, my haven dark
I wait in dreamless sleep
The day to pass, the dusk to come
The time to leave my keep

My loneliness makes you feel insecure
My loneliness will never let you find a cure
My loneliness has no directions for me and you
My loneliness speaks no truth of what you do
Listen to what I say
Turn me in
You're going crazy and I can't stand to feel your tears over me
Turn me in
It's not a crime to feel the way that I do, again and again
My loneliness does not lead you to my core
My loneliness always tells you to ignore
My loneliness, a waste of time if there's no trust
My loneliness is turning everything to dust
Listen to what I say
Turn me in
You're going crazy and I can't stand to feel your tears over me
Turn me in
It's not a crime to feel the way that I do, again and again
No one can save us from this pain
I wish that I could stop the rain
These dark gray skies are closing in
Oh
You're going crazy and I can't stand to feel your tears over me
Turn me in
It's not a crime to feel the way that I do, again and again

Water, water, prevail my searing landscape
water, water, relieve my pain and let me in
fire, fire, paint all your flames on my skin
fire, fire, burn deep and purify my sin
water, water, take on your child for dying
father, father, I know I promised you to swim
I am the plastic you adore
I am the nail to hold your door
I am the light you ll never find
I am the sun of far gone times
I am the sun of far gone life
you drown in a lake of fire, my blame divine are you
how deep are the scars in your head? As deep as once your screw?
and now that you burned your wings, say how it feels to be denied?
how sweet is the darkest fire, when the water by your side?
I am the plastic you adore
I am the nail to hold your door
I am the light you ll never find
I am the sun of far gone times
I am the sun of far gone life
I am the plastic you adore
I am the nail to hold your door
I am the light you ll never find
still I'm the sun of far gone times
still I'm the sun of far gone life
hold on, through the flames you walk as I leave your horizon
bleed on, to the waves you talk in your fevered delight now
dreep on, under burning rooms and falling mindstars
so long, keep the sun and the moon... and tell'em of your scars
...maybe they will care

My own hand was the instrument destruction was imminent the pain of sorrow
was too much to bear I walked away and you never said a word punishment
enough I hang my hand I cannot look you in the eye coming chaos engulfs me
there was no warning it is never too late to start a new breaking the crutch
of the passive nature I will seize salvation that has eluded my grasp had I
only listened I was in earshot whispering shouting your ancient wisdom my
mind changes with every breath I cannot deny this burning sensation that
comes with understanding do now pass me by that was never your way.

Now buildings are starting to fall
Bricks beginning to break
Your steps are leaving cracks in the sidewalks
Leaving trails of empty streets
And I'm going blind from staring at your eyes
Because they release the fire of a thousand suns
But I've grown so numb I can barely shed a tear
Even if you cut the strings that hold my head up
You're pulling teeth
Ripping flesh so you can lick the blood from your fingers
So break these bones taste my skin
Let my death sing the end of it
So you can do no more damage
So you collect no more trophies
Let me be the last
Let no one feel how I feel
This tragedy began with me
So let it end with me
From your hell I've become this numb
I wish this pain on no one
Behind your smile
Beneath your lungs
I hope your darkness comes
This tragedy began with me
So let it end with me
I tried to be what you wanted me to be
And I'm sorry that I can never be perfect for you
But every time I look in the the mirror
I see your eyes staring right back at me
And I don't want it anymore
I hope you're fucking happy

waking restless and alive
these thoughts stifled for some time
let's go
dust off those shoes
grab a brush and my heart
we'll paint this town a wound of its own
those blues to red
a new sun rises overhead
we'll leave these blues for crimson red
this broken heart will mend
those doldrum days are laid to their end
won't worry about tomorrow or yesterday
regrets only bring sorrow and tonight is sorrows fall
this town won't know what hit them
like the first time i saw you

Glance to break you away from her. A bond you
Sanctioned by sound and honored with a lack of
Penetration. Eating Daisies and licking roses, the
Bitter fruits of bickering politicians. And there he
Stood a model of perfection. Careless and fit with
Contempt for me. Could you predict this before you.
Did you fall to your knees in guilt. Could you fake a
Single tear to tide over his want of righteousness.
What would it take? Time to sort out your mind still
Crippled by deviance? Take it off and show yourself. I
Touch not out of want or need. I haven't the taste for
Bitterness. I touch nothing for it's all you are.
There's that thought again. There's no one here but
You and me. No one needs to know a thing. It's a done
Deal, I'll slip in. What happens on the road. Will
Stay on the road. Don't think less of me, I'm just a
Man with needs. I won't tell you twice to get out of
My head and stay awake behind locked doors. And there
She stood a model of temptation. Again, wet and
Willing with no faith in me. Still I passed your
Twisted test whether in the flesh or in my dreams. Get
Out of my head and stay awake behind closed doors.
Come not with me to correct and condemn. Get out of my
Bed and stay awake.

Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be
Death, the epitome of all of our days
In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
Close your eyes and visualize the demon to arise
You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
In the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
In the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
When I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
We've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...
One more time to escape from all this madness
One more time to be set free from all this sadness
And one last time to be the one who understands
My soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity
Foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be
Death is the destiny for all of our ways
In the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say
When I see the power of the demon come alive
You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
On the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun
Reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won
Can you see the debauchery and the blade of death that has come for thee
In winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...
One more time to escape from all this madness...

Every path will lead to war
It's carved in stone, our fate is sealed
Promise that we'll meet again
Just make it cross the battlefield
Everybody bleeds the same
In pitch black darkness, who can tell?
Mooring on through the madness
We buried brothers where they fell
Every path will lead to war
It's carved in stone, our fate is sealed
Promise that we'll meet again
Just make it cross the battlefield
Everybody bleeds the same
In pitch black darkness, who can tell?
Mooring on through the madness
We buried brothers where they fell
A name
A name
A name
I'd give my soul for a name
Something
Something
Something
Let me feel like there's something for me
Just one more hill to climb
Just one last song of glory
You said that we could fight the dawn
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Where can we go from here but down?
You've cursed us all
Every step a greater lie
And every night the same old dream
Swallowed in a wave of flesh
And nobody can hear me scream
Everybody turned in shame
Don't want to see the house we've built
Peel our skin and stab our eyes
It's all it takes to hide our guilt
A name
A name
A name
I'd give my soul for a name
Something
Something
Something
Let feel like there's something for me
Just one more hill to climb
Just one last song of glory
You said that we could fight the dawn
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Where can we go from here but down?
You've cursed us all
Just one more hill to climb
Just one last song of glory
You said that we could fight the dawn
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Where can we go from here but down?
You've cursed us all

There's something evil in the sky
it's haunting me and I just can't hide
it's getting closer more and more
to start the war
Fight and believing
that's what I'm aiming for
so tells the story
there goes out my prayer
The brave and the strong
will always be on my side
nothing can tear me apart
when darkness surrounds you
I'll be your shining star
even thou the battle rages on
the fear arises with the night
nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide
the time has come to raise your sword
against the evil unknown

Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tear me up inside
Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
The way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed
My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame
So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, curse my name
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame
Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tear your souls apart
Censorship can't stop my truth
We speak straight from our hearts
There is nothing you can do
We'll tear your souls apart
So see us rise, we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe
The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tear your souls apart

Am I mentally weak?
as the masses, acting like rats
And now killing eachother
and it feels like they deserve it
Denied all the lies so far
begging for the fall
The smiling plague that we are
don't think it doesn't suite you, just follow...
And now they all walk through the flames
and still they follow them blindly
Let's give in to the madness
as so many times before
History repeats itself
what a happy ending
Denied all the lies so far
begging for the fall
The smiling plague that we are
don't think it doesn't suite you, just follow...

The cold winds of war, numb the nations soul
They taste the bitter fear as a grim future appears
Criminal leaders building hate
Under siege the world segregates
The day has come, the end is at hand
The earth a corpse, a barren waste land
Cower in fear, humanity prays
Blood upon, our final days
No god can grant any salvation
There's no escaping incineration
Bound and tortured, heads kicked in
Children slaughtered, heads kicked in
Nations ruptured, heads kicked in
Lives aborted, heads kicked in
In this world terror reigns supreme
The earth a carcass with its bones picked clean
Inpending doom, too little too late
Clenched inside the fist of fate
With savage bloodlust, we feed on the kill
Self destruction, our only true skill
Will our children ever get a clean slate
Barbaric society, united in hate
The charred remains of war machines
The lifeless twisted bodies
Blind eyes that peer from their heads
The crowded carraiges of the dead

I blew the ambulance up
So no one could survive
I'm fucking stupid like that
I'm a fucking idiot
These are the balls you lick
Forever and ever and ever
Ambulance burning
School bus is burning
The whole fucking block is on fire
The whole fucking block is on fire
In this just lesser hell

Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat
My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day
The oldest of souls, left behind after life
Before death I was nothing but human
Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug
It warms my cold soul
Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat
Rejuvenation of my body
No blood left to scab
Now it flows through my veins
Heaven I have found
Fear in my grip
Transcend beyond mortal
The sweet blood
I will swallow
Draining the inner spirit
Feasting on the power
Knowing only pleasure
Human blood I devour
Ghastly beauty look into my eyes
To reproduce with the living
Every century
Impregnation of the virgin
I drink the blood of the unborn
Returning to my grave
Dragging my blood drained prey
My body burns from the light
Sleeping until night
In my clutch, you greet me with open arms
Soon I will rip them off
And drink the blood from the stumps
Life and death are too clear
But mankind is blind to see
The twisted path of their own mortality
Scripts of the dead
Netherworld knowledge
Rotten fragrance lingers
Unleash the odor
I have risen
Vampire
Zombie
Sucking on
Arteries
Body
Numbs
One of my sons died for your sins
Resurrect him so I can
Drink his blood again

Steadily on jagged wings
Feather black against the burning sky
Spread your wings and ride the wind
Gaze down on me with blackest eyes.
Fly my ravens, fly ahead.
Over the mountains and endless sky
Fly my ravens, fly ahead
Over the mountains over my head.
Let the wind carry you up high.
Fly my ravens, it's time to fly,
And for me maybe to die.
Valley of Death in the land of no return
The moment of glory or death

Loved without any condition only to have this heart ripped out. With every hope comes
more fear. All that's given was taken away. You turned your back come after I opened
up my heart to you. Loved with all certainty just to find a place in your heart. Left to
watch my world fall apart in your hands. Left to watch my life perish inside your
heart. But watch if you missed this life to love. But what if you missed this love to live.

Sometimes thinking of suicide
The thought that sharpens my mind
Deep down in manic depression
I only hear my own cries
These thoughts are so twisted I can hardly
Look out from the edge of my world
Those feelings of losing every sense of touch
I tried to reach with my hands
Sometimes thinking of suicide
The thought that sharpens my mind
Sometimes life feels much cheaper
So cold, dull and grey
These thoughts are so twisted I can hardly
Look out from the edge of my world
Those feelings of losing every sense of touch
I tried to reach with my hands

Rebuild
Cannot close our eyes
Construction paper traffic corner office destruction
The cityscape burns brighter by the hour
Clock tower: bring us all down
Marching like ants to the foundation of a higher form
Trash. Capped and smothered
Trash bag
Trash hat
Wrinkle-free clients of doom
Feed me fear (informal gluttony)
Construction paper lawns force-fed attention grabber
when will you learn
First come first serve
The all you can eat trumpet, playing the tunes of our death
Breathe, now blow
Now blow
Let it be heard
The preacher's talent is going through the airwaves
(I need to be led in the right direction. Set up the bumpers
Running in the gutter)
The little kids taught me well
but I wonder why they don't listen anymore
(It's a television nightmare)
Eat and watch, eat eat eat, what they feed
Corner office tubes, give me the best view in the hut
Feed me fear (informal gluttony)

tat twam asi
lost in a wilderness
i will build a fire
i become a fire
to swim in the waters
burrowing and bellowing
into a consciousness
kicking against
yet we're needing to want this
sucking and bleeding
now knee deep in substance
pulling and dragging
fail to allow ourselves
as we move to consciousness
as we move through consciousness
as we move to consciousness
driven by need for transecendence
tat twam asi
focus on the focusless
focusless is the focus
look into the self
one name branded deep
burning and singing
the markings of the soul
turning more turning
we assimilate ourselves
needing the push
a sea of flailing limbs
push to create
an equalibrium
as we move to consciousness
as we move through consciousness
as we move to consciousness
driven by need for transecendence

beyond my self i percieve my own ability
and through these wormholes i search
inside and out of me
i'm not exactly what i'd like to be
so i suffocate my siddhis
gain momentum once again
tell myself don't ever let them
drag you down
i'll take the pain
and wish you all away
i'll take the blame
and wish you all away

Society's selfish meaning to confine
Disabled by the need to cure an insecurity
Masses strive to keep themselves in line
While the radical seek attention all the time
Say they're sick - just hypochondriacs
Cry some more, I know it's all an act
Lies...taken to extremes
Despised...because of what they need
A selfish thought to please themselves
They strive to succeed in what they're looking for
Defying, lying, rebelling for attention
A disability taken from one extreme to another
[chorus]
Abusing rights, defying given laws
Excessive whining, they desire sympathy
Rebel, they prove their lives are just a flaw
Immoderate acts plagued by the disease
I proved them wrong but they're the ones to blame
Defeated fair and square at their own game

Rain and thunder, fire and wind
Come with me, I leave with the tide
I wrap my cloak closer 'round my shoulders
To keep me warm from the raging storm
The spirits are here to guide my journey
Over the edge of the world
A thousand wounds cry in my soul
Love and pain, a bleeding heart
Where the runes still speak
I'm coming home
Where the runes still speak
Alone I stand on this stony coast
Winds of spring whisper through the trees
The grey horizon gives me life again
Tee, and stone, the voices of the gods
No woman can show me where the fire burns
No preacher can tell me who I am
My blood is calling me from Asaland
I'm on my way home in the end
A homeward son will claim his heritage
Walk the soil of this earth
The pen will be his mighty sword
And the truth his defense
I've traveled roads that lead to wonder
I've seen cities rise and fall
The burden, the cross of a pilgrim
I bear no more, the son is coming home
You closed the door, but I won't give
Somewhere my new life will begin
Countless treasures I shared with you
The only one left is my solitude

Are You covered? Are You under this stone?
Can I call You? Can I see You alone?
Will You show up? Is it Your place or mine?
Are we friendly? What You seek You shall find,
Seven road blocks
From tonight
Polka mini
Obscurity defenestration
Old fame reclaimed
For straighter roads and rule by force
New age of rage
Of bias and uncivil wars
Now it always start from the bottom
When it comes to boil
And our history always runs upon the foil
And we always wish that the future
Shall be born without pain
But everybody wants to drive our train
In the gutter we can settle the score
But You don't know who You settle it for
All around You is the enemy You dread
And Your vision is a map of Your head
A million toad halls
The table's set
Marble cake
The princess on the pea is raging
Old fame reclaimed
For straighter roads and rule by force
New age of rage
Of bias and uncivil wars
Are You covered? Are You under this stone?
Can I call You? Can I see You alone?
Will You show up? Is it Your place or mine?
Undercurrent of the nation's decline

The god sighed and silence was born
A tortured life is spared of vision
And it's painful when it's worn
The cloak of shame spares no protection
His world is made of steel
In his hands he bent the fire
To mold a thing so real
A burning world born of desire
[Chorus]
His hope was not enough
To fill an empty cup
He simply let it drain into the nowhere
There is no reckoning
There is no bargaining
In symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping
We stand below rinsed by the tears
Unlike rain they bring no healing
Rust corrodes the souls
Of children wrought to match his image
Abandoned with all of his cares
No choice but to wait for the kindness of time
To erase us one and all
To flow like a river with no beginning
Head in hands and weary eyes
The failures scratch and carve the lines
Into the face of one
The lines into the face of none
He sees the world
He sees his dreams
And nothing's ever as it seems
The promise was so real
Now all that's left is crumbled steel
No prayers are said in his name
Nobody knew that he ever existed
Alone he accepts all the blame
Plaintively wonders how dreams become twisted
And he waits for another to come
Another, a chance to revive from the nothing
The fabric to weave once again
To forge from the fire his vision of man

I am the pain you feel
As your soul is ripped to pieces
I am all that you fear
Close your eyes and i'll be there
Insanity rules this world
The face of evil is everywhere
I damn the souls of those who rule
I hope you'll die in pain
War for a religious cause
War for a piece of land
War for a religious cause
I was born to hate
I am the pain you feel
As your soul is ripped to pieces
I am all that you fear
Close your eyes and i'll be there

Lyrics by Mike DiSalvo and Gen Guay DiSalvo
Cryptopsy - And Then Youll Beg - 2000
Seeing that this blood sequence
Is most unfortunate
Hallowed be thy immortal
Free from constrictions
And that ridiculous boundry
Called life
Fly my pretty
However, stay close to me
Omen bearer, ecstatic shiver
Like a woman just crossed my grave
Almost blind sight for sour eyes
And tickled my fancy
Delicate. Pure. Mine.
Simply soulmated
The heavens serene selection
Gods reflection
Something tells me
You might not know me now
You will soon
First fucking things first
Would bet on you a smile
That this other fella
Will disapear for a while
No mind to a constant observant
I watch
Two is a show but three is a crowd
Pardon me, may i have this dance
As for you sir
Your services have been rendered useless
And are no longer needed
Sleep that deep slumber
Cleverly infiltrate the daily procedures
Enjoy this moment
Perfect timing, perfect beauty
Thank you for inviting
Ill drop by for a minute (or two)
Upon my ringing, youre cordially obliged
Couldnt have been better
If Id been asked for dinner
Lept that step
Beyond a casual notice
Full fledged admiration
Might be deemed a social misfit
Never asked, never cared
Never spared a worthless existence
The big splash, your life in a flash
Of tornados forming, frenzied whirlwind
Of times and places, people and faces
Fear has a scent thats unmistakable
Its growing, building, mutating, ascending
Youve created a lover, well respected
Undeniably desired
Popculture idolatry, root vulture misery
In the wake of my own hero parade
An army of one,
Havent had this much fun
As a couple deeply in obsession
Screams go unheard

The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To behold the end of horizon
Observation of foresights
Inhaling circulations of the soul
The aura of stars, the fusion of frequencies
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases
The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear
The aura of stars, the fusion of frequences
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases
I am midst by the cause of reality
Entwined by the senses of fantasy
I have walked through fields of grievance
Eras of spiritual fragmentation
I have walked through the wood's of peasants
Dawn of the souls solar morning
The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear
The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To spear the hallow star
Conservation of the solar fuse
Exhaling circulations of the soul
The aura of stars, the fusion of frequences
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases
I have fallen through spheres of diversity
Eras of ending spiritual solemnity
Opened the gate of ion fire
The warming well of wisdom
Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy
Reflection of a soul's tear
Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy
"I am the soul in the sphere. The sphere of the heir"
The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear

His actions were slated
His guts were hated
His day, night, his life should be truncated
His demise the townsfolk plotted
(ah ah)
Ambushed, beaten and garroted
Curse of the Tollund man
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund man
Accused of witchcraft
Hung, drawn and halved
Confronted by death
To them I just laugh
Executed for unlawful carnage
(ah)
Buried in peat just outside the wood bridge
Curse of the Tollund man
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund man
(Oh)
Eyes of the Tollund man
Rise did the Tollund man
Unleashed a terror upon everyone that he saw
Curse of the Tollund man
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund man
This evil must not be unearthed
Curse of the Tollund man!
Nothing worse than that
Curse of the Tollund man
This evil must not be unearthed

Lyrics: Stanne
Cast out from a world of selfdeceit
in senseless fear of denial
Forgive the others indifference
and on paths of wisdom trait
In grief thou shalt not wander
With hopefilled heart now walk
Do not fear the slow proceeding
Fear only the stillness of invention
Mocking words and actions a defeat
for intellect and mind
Saveth me for I know not how
to break free from these chains of scorn
Oh I wonder how can I turn the sense of doubt
in the minds of them all
Our needs are depending in images in life
and the more you agree in the far more they ask
I am an outcast but I am free to speak
the words from my heart
And when I know the secrets
in the minds of the weak
I shall return and be grateful
For the lessons learned from the past
Hear me, See me
I am now forever one with myself
I sense the forces that deep within me burn
I smell remains of fear forever gone
I feel now comfort with who I have to be
Now is the time for retributive thoughts
To be content is happiness
Not the overflow of material things
that we seek to make a stand
in this era of greed and self-inflicted
pain in the shape of disappointment
Do not fear the slow proceeding
That's all I ask of thee
What lies ahead you will never know
so come prepared
Oh I wish for thee to see the vast plains
and the field, The open seas, The wailing trees
The treasures of my kingdom
reach the level of understanding now
exploring, Considering the actions of the past
On a journey forever
Still you're in the water struggling
while I clasp the skies
Can you see the lifeblood dripping
from the cheek of everscorn?
Yes I can!
I am an outcast but I am free to speak
the words from my heart
And when I know the secrets
in the minds of the weak
I shall return and be grateful
For the lessons learned from the past
Hear me, See me
I am now forever one with myself

[Ozzy Osbourne cover]
Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquer
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tommorows
Away tommorows
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper
'Cos you feel life's unreal, and you're living a lie
Such a shame, who's to blame, and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask, is there life after birth
What you saw can mean hell on this earth
Hell on this earth
Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's travelling at full throttle
It's catching you, but you don't see
The reaper's you, and the reaper is me
Breaking laws, knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide, suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about
Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquer
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows

Now the funeral grounds are at last awash
With the blackness of this frigid autumn night
I've lurked into the graveyard with pick and spade in tow
This night shall birth forth our reckoning
Hell's jaws, now open wide
A stare to pierce six feet of soil
A love beyond this mortal coil
As though you'd never left my side,
I hold your stiffened body so close to me
For years I've lived in a dream
Awake, I felt as dead as my cold and bloodless bride to me
I can barely suppress my elation!
My blood is racing as I strike the lid
A quick pry of the casket reveals her body, paralyzed
So long I've waited for this moment,
To thrust my fingers deep inside!
Now you will (sing) the song of the deceased
The ones whose souls will never rest in peace!
The throes of necromantic lust
Possess my mind
Cries of my precious frozen angel beckon from inside
I feel alive! for once I'm feeling so alive
My skin is crawling,
I'm completed on this resurrection night
(from this night achieved) a morbid truth
Love's bounds post-mortally removed
(chorus)
In rapture my mind is lured by my own knife
To join this frrrragile being who sleeps below
The reflection of a razor reveals the moon, so perfectly
Along my impatient veins its steel does/doth graze
With the kiss of suicide!
I feel no pain as I (am entwined) lay with my love-ly bride
The silk lining now stained with my offering
I embrace the end of my now worthless life

Walk away, into the dark
Come my way, terror
I am the evil within each soul
I take the spirits of those I kill
Murdered
Decomposition, The body rots
Rotting, rotting body parts
I killed the first
To experiment
I don't want to hurt you
I just want to kill you
Torture, I start to cut
Carving, blood slowly clots
Horrors, mutilations
Homicidal experimentation
I set the dead on fire
To decay in flame
Homicidal desire
More are marked for murder
More victims to capture
Butchered
Bodies hang dead
Drained of all their blood
Pieces sewn on backwards
Neck with no heads
Mutilated, dead
Homicidal desire
More are marked for murder
More victims to butcher

Searching every day, looking every way
Trying to make a connection, to find a piece of the action
Like a hungry poet, who doesn't know
He is close to perfection, choice is the question
Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side by side they will see us ride
VBut if they cared to look, than they would see
It's our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Can you understand, that in every man
There's a need to unwind, that's never been defind
Somewhere deep within, there's another bveing
You are somehow avbusing, by the person you're using
Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side vby side they will see us ride
But if they cvared to look, than they would see
It's our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Travvelling faster than lightning
Closer than ever before
We can go on for you, and take you nearer to
The legend of mystery from the beginning of time
Dreaming... TIME... Dreaming
We can return to the land of the good and the kind
TIME... Dreaming... TIME... Dreaming
Why don't you come to our party and open your minds
In another place, there's a newer face
Like an unfinished painting, your creator is waiting
The brush and pen describe, what it is inside
That will set your mind thinking, while the others are sinking
Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side by, side they will se us ride
But if they cared to look, than they would see
It's just our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, oh yeah
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy

Fallen angel, how you've changed
Poison runs through your veins
You were never a saint but now you're a sin
Spoiled and rotten from within
Who clipped your wings so useless?
Cut your child then yourself?
Chewed off your own?
Good thinking
You were coming apart
And I thought I could help you
Through the fever
Not the first one
Not the last one
I'm not sorry for you
Find out if your transsexual
I remember a time
When everything that you knew
I thought I already knew in my mind
And I thought you knew the same
And I thought you knew the same
And I thought you knew the same
Well I thought you knew the same
I know truth will set you free
I know truth will set you free
Cracked and crazy, baby
I know truth will set you free

As I die...
Stare as eyes uphold me
And wait to see right through
And curse me...
The love has crippled you
Shadows haunt the night
Burning my disguise
As I die
Reaping through the truth
Life becomes untrue
Sin the last diversion
My fate will be untouched
Dismissed now, the anger of a fool
Shadows haunt the night
Forgive me as I die
Taking a chance
And take what you gain
My soul it has no price
Total release is out of harms way until I can decide
You punish me, can't you see, I'm not real
Tears are flowing free, passing by, as I die

The human body, in its systematic nature
Has 3 primary objectives
1 Procreate
2 Food intake
3 The elimination of waste
This is the human equation
One half is feces, the other mammal
The human as shit
This is what you've become
The end result of human stupidity
Another mesh of flesh with no dignity
A solid waste with dull neuronal activity
2000 years from now
They'll discover our coprolite
Learn of disease and parasite
Enough to know what made us tick
Enough to make them sick
Anatomy
Scat anthropology
The study of man
Micturate, here's to your health
Defecate upon the self
Felch the goddamn sphinct
And gurgle it's disgusting contents
Playing king of the hill
On a mountain of manure
On a planet called earth
Mirroring what we're worth
We are nothing but a failure
Evolution took a shit
In my heart, through these eyes
Humankind in its own shit resides
2000 years from now
They'll examine our coprolite
Gain perspective and insight
Enough to know what made us tick
And that we're made of shit

Metal thrashing mad
Oh yeah
Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
I'm a madman at the wheel
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engines roar
Got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad, yeah
I'm metal thrashing mad, yeah
Driving like a maniac
Can't go any faster
Burning up the road
And heading for disaster
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engines roar
Got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad, yeah yeah
Ooh yeah, oh
Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
I'm a madman at the wheel
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engines roar
Got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engines roar
Got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad, oh

Evil surrounds you, channelling hell
Through the seal...
The only answer lies within
Beholder of all sorrow
The root of damnation, eternal dedication
The night closes in
Dark and cold
Life is an abyss
Profound as a thousand nights
Through the seal of the dark
A journey through the bleakest mist
Evil surrounds you
The presence of death
The gates to madness
Channelling hell
The only answer lies within
Over the ice-cold fjords
Under the wind-swept mountains
The deepest of all forests
Where darkness lies unknown
A layrinth of trees
Grown on the most unholy soil
Forever in darkness
I have touched the hands of death
Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears
The root of damnation
Suck the marrow of the fucking bone
Eternal dedication
We, brotherhood of the blood
Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears

Sin of doubt
It exists and it grows
A glimpse of life
From somewhere deep within
Oh, I couldn't understand!
Is it anyone else?
Is somebody screaming?
Please help me!
I don't know that I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation!
Here it comes - the real me
I didn't know I could hear the answer
My mind is blank, I feel a drone
Alone at night but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me!
(Another stranger me)
That's when the ice will break away
I can't get out here anymore
'Cause my locked keys in the door
There's fear and anger
Hate and love
I must confess it's self hate
It's s[]!
It's s[]!
Still s[], call my laughter
It's s[]!
Just m[]!
It's s[]!
Call her laughter
If there's some way in
It soon will be over
Will burn out!
Souls and fate
We're in a room now
Give up your cruel invasion!
You're insane, I'll show you
I didn't know I could hear the answer
My mind is blank, I feel a drone
Alone at night but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me!
How long - Can't resist
Come and fall
A bolt of pain keeps ripping through my head
Oh I can take no more!
Don't tell anyone else!
I do not believe her!
She hates me!
Cloak my mind
She's a deciever...
I can feel cruel vibration
Would you like to meet me?
I didn't know I could hear the answer
My mind is blank, I feel a drone
Alone at night but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me!
Another stranger me!

poor old God has died when they took his feet
take another breath of a faint belief
saw him on your trace and he'll take no rest
paid to be the first but just got the 2nd best
all we need is life and a ship to leave
vultures in the back and a snake at ease
call me by the name of a feminist
silent is the shot for she never will be missed
catch me on a white line
as lonely as my God's sign
the truth is not polite so let's make it worse
navigate the sheep in the devil's hearse
Saw him near your place soon he'll be your guest
tremble for a life that you never have possessed
all we need is love and the will to hate
shotgun in the left, in the other one our fate
silver-bullets served by the hypocrite
monkey on the back for we never will admit
silent as a landmine
as lonely as my God's sign

Forensic fetishism
By erogenuos rottenatomy aroused
Shameless self-fondling aggressively abetted
By the embaldming fluid with which you are doused
Tagged, stabbed and lavaged
You`ve passed beyond the veil
Blood replaced by formaldehyde
Your lifeless flesh so pale
Now I pay my last disrespects
Here are my final regards:
As it was in life so it is now in death
Cold, grim and hard!
FUNERAL FUCK
FUNERAL FUCK
Entangled in lust`s contorted embrace
Undulating within the shroud
And I`m proud to do my part
In making your passing cum laude
I orgasm in the open casket
Wanking on your wake,
Writhing on the slab,
With each liberty I take
Now I pay my last disrespects
Here are my final regards:
As it was in life so it is now in death
Cold, grim and hard!
FUNERAL FUCK
FUNERAL FUCK
The naked and the dead
Carnal knowledge so corrupt
Consummating your death certificate
Your eternal rest I lustily disrupt
The last rites are invoked in moans
As I grovel in my intimacy
At least you aren`t facing death alone
Your ends is my means to ecstasy
Now I pay my last disrespects
Here are my final regards:
As it was in life so it is now in death
Cold, grim and hard!
FUNERAL FUCK
FUNERAL FUCK

Music & Lyrics By:Laurie Berkner
So I went down to the pretzel store
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more
Let me tell you all about those crazy shapes
Twisty, curvy, holey, and straight
But I don't want to eat pretzels today
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into birds
And flew away
Everyday
They flew away
Oh, those tricky pretzels
So I went back to the pretzel store
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more
Let me tell you all about that yummy flavory
Salty, sweet, and a little bit savory
But I don't want to eat pretzels today
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into rainbow fish
And swam away
Everyday
They swam away
Oh, those tricky pretzels
So I went back to the pretzel store
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more
Let me tell you all about those favorite toppings
Chocolate dipped and honey whipped
But I don't want to eat pretzels today
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into horses
And galloped away
Everyday
They galloped away
Oh, those tricky pretzels
"Neigh!"

a little man who throws conscience to the wind
he always takes me back to where I started from again
he says that you're worth it put God on a shelf
you've got what it takes deny your maker deny yourself
who's gonna win this thing the devil or me
a day to day battle between the devil and me
step off twenty paces and fire
devil and me
a classic bout it seems I'm always on the ropes
rob me of my sanity my dignity all of my hope
the way to heaven is what's to be found
I've got news for you satan I'll be back for another round
who's gonna win this thing the devil or me
a day to day battle between the devil and me
step off twenty paces and fire
devil and me

The night erupts with the sound of small arms fire
Tracer rounds snakes through the air
Signal flares fly towards the sky
Prepare yourself for another assault
I raise my gun and let lead fly
Living the horrors of war
Move 'em down left to right
I've tasted blood now I want more
Screams of pain echoes through the night
As bullets find their targets
Mercilessly ripping through your flesh
Spraying intestines and bone all around
Into our trench they fall
The combat goes hand to hand
In a killing frenzy I split someones head
Comrade or enemy I just don't care

Now my eyes start to smile again
You can't try, can't understand
Leve me in my world
I know my god is cold
Can't stand the heat, never had much fun
Here it comes my winter sun
You can't see it bright
In my own feelings he rises
My only winter, you keep my
Desires alive
My endless winter, confine me
Inside your light
In this garden of Eden I live again
Reassured by hope from my fallings born
Walking on my illusions I breathe the end
How many flowers will die
Got a soul forever doomed to escape
Wandering through a landless path
Rain on my better self
A rose will bloom from my ashes
My only winter, you keep my
Desires alive
My endless winter, confine me
Inside your light
My only winter, you keep my
Desires alive
My endless winter, confine me
Inside your light
In this river my nightmares scatter and drown
I fell free in this higher ground
Swimming in my ilusions, lost in the dark
Where the sky shines black for my eyes

the body of god who died and rose from the dead
the eye of the body which will never be killed
first trinity above the earth taking care
and the god of the night, desert, and storm
your stony cemeteries
impossible to destroy, above time flowing
in the gloom of the night
in the light of the eye of horus
they last
eternal truth,power of words and knowledge
the river of life, the land of the dead
fathers of the moon, creators of clandestine books
and son of su,cursed,powerful
gods with stolen names
rituals forgotten forever
gods of the land which doesnt exist
the eye of horus a monument of the world
which is left to oblivion

Man - born with the nature of evil
All inherited the sin from Adam
No man escaped
The commandments - the law
No one were able to fulfil
No man was pure
Everyone's share was death
All was dark - hopelessness ruled
Light intervened
Annihilating darkness
The path of salvation made clear
For the prodigal human race
Given to mankind
For all to receive
The sacrifice of life
For all to believe
This unnatural act of love
A model for succession
The act of forgiveness
A supernatural force

This is chaos theory simplified and stretched out before a jury. No warning has been issued. No compliments have been wholesomely handed out. The time hasn't been used up until it burns. Fear the wounded for they walk the earth stronger. Destroy the loathsome for they only weaken the machine. Running the tightrope until the rope runs out. Run it all into the ground then rebuild. The constructs on the boundaries we've been given are unfair. And mother earth doesn't love you. Our remorse has gone far beyond forgiveness. Until the rope runs out. Run it all into the ground. For when in Rome we shall do as the Romans.

Do you ever look back, and feel an ounce of regret,
do you ever remember, oh how could you ever forget
You will be in my deleted scenes,
right now you're nothing me,
I'm searching I am searching
for a way to get my hands around your throat
There's no way I can forgive and forget,
what done is done and what's been said has been said,
what's been said has been said
There hasn't been a day,
I've not wished to see your face,
Walking by my window,
hunger builds for the thrill of the chase
So quick to betray, and push your friends away
With hungry eyes I'll watch you squirm,
I'll watch you fall from grace
Don't ever show your face again round here,
you're not welcome anymore
The decisions you chose to make
erased the bond we had before
What was going through your head?
Why did you choose that path to follow?
You chose a life of betrayal
instead you soulless fuck
Your rise and demise, I shall bear witness
There is no point in your existence
You put a price on all your friends
Now tell me was it worth it in the end?
You turned your back
on everyone that ever cared for you
I hope you get what you deserve
before this is all through
This open letter to the world
Which i hope you have time to read
Says remember where you came from
Don't ruin your life with greed
How do you even sleep at night
Knowing the ones you left behind
On a bed of snakes, you slimey cunt
You can't undo all the damage you've done

I am the wanderer, I am the lie
I bring famine, and I kill all life
I sweep across the land
I walk the dead earth
The children shall Endure
I am as old as time
I am of lust and sin
I am invoked by bloodthirst
I rule the underworld
The children shall Endure
And to be remembered,
Silent screams are never heard
I am mystery, I am truth
I am the tale you wished you never heard
My dark shadow dwell
In the darkest pits of hell
I am the propechy of a dying world
I am vengeance, I am wrath
I am the seven Death sins
Come walk my path

Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?
Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?
Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength
Free your spirit from those who lead in praise
Recollect the anger and the hate
For not shall your morals dissolve in pity
Righteous warmth accompanied
By deceitful tongues
Stay away from processed promises
Let them fear what you know
A malicious smile on their lips
To keep us all under control
Now it's time to rise and demand our due
The whores and their illusions left us bitter and cold
Drench them in their own poison, spit back the scorn of their ways
Out win their defect morality, and the words they pray
Consolidate the troops and expose the lies in their eyes
The ones deprived from the ecstasy that binds the neglect
Better lead than being led, earn any victory
For you stand superior above the plague and it's mass
The burden of proof rests on your shoulders
Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?
Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?

So this is it, my time to live.
I can't sit around and let my life pass by.
Take a chance, this may be your last shot
and don't think about your wasted past.
Let's make something of this time while we still can.
Tonight we show these kids how we do this.
So tonight, let's go out and show these kids how we do this.
Put on your dancing shoes, it's time to rock.
IT'S FUCKING TIME TO ROCK BABY!
Put on your dancing shoes, it's time to rock.

Dreaming all alone
Wandering thru the time so cold
Confronting something old
That I've been sometimes lied and told
Tombstone underneath me
Ancients' ancient grave I see
Death I can feel
The Undead is what I need
I can see the ancients falling
Can you hear the ancients crying
I can see the ancients dying
Can you hear the ancients calling
They seek you, you're their hope
They need you, you're their life
Can you feel the ancients near you
I can lead the ancients' war
They seek you, you're their hope
They need you, you're their life
They know you, you feel them
They trust you, you've found them now
Standing on a grave
On where lies one brave
Movements of dead will tell
Soon earth bounds like hell
Can you hear the ancients crying
Can you hear the ancients calling
Can you feel the ancients near you
Yes I can, Yes I can

Hear me, ancient forefather (Ambiorix)
Honoured be Thy deeds
Leading our tribes against the aggressor
Outnumbered, a campaign that could not be won
(But forever Thy blood in my veins)
Gracious Spartan civilisation
Eternally blessed Thy war spirit
Surrounded by thousands of Persians
"Molon lave" a final proud statement
(None of thee survived
but Thy Hellenic glory is everlasting)
Noble was your cause, brave Vercingetorix
Sad the day of your sacrifice
An example to your Celt tribe
Dying in solitude
(But Thy soul) forever in my heart
Remember the moment Jerusalem fell
The shrieks of the conquered, the conqueror's yell
The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared
The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared
Aris! And Aris shone!
Mars! And Mars rose!
Geuzen der Lage Landen
Van Antwerpen, Amsterdam tot Den Briel
Helden der Calvinistische droom
Nachtmerrie der Spaans/Roomse overheerser
Voor eeuwig Uw bloed in onze aderen
Noble was your cause, brave Vercingetorix
Sad the day of your sacrifice
Hear me, ancient forefather Ambiorix
Honoured be Thy deeds
Leading our tribes against the aggressor
Outnumbered, a campaign that could not be won
Forever Thy blood in my veins
Noble was your cause
Sad the day of your sacrifice
An example to our tribe

From my world the sun faded
And the moon from my sky was gone with stars
I came home to a bleak room of sorrow
Forsaken house, place of grief, in solitude
I listened to my heart beating
The faint rush of my blood
I listened to my heart beating
The echoes from space
Something moving in the emptiness
Something drew me near
Someone told me of my future deeds
Whispered them in my ear
The sky stirred
The lights of space flared
Beneath my feet
The living earth started to breathe
This sky is mine
This sword is mine
This fate is mine
This miracle, mine
From steel I made the master's sword
Cleaves stone, cliff, a mountain
From darkness I stepped
Onto the path of stars

Leaving the grind the mirror behind
loosing the ringth then and there
Whisper it was someone else and not me
How I wish I could
I keep the secret within deep inside
Grasping without reaching anything
I am alone here to seek for the truth
and your dead star is burning be weak
I am a ghost
Dwelling inside myself
Please forgive me if you're able
I do not know what I do
The inner autumn shrouds everything
The eternal rain that drown my soul
I am a ghost
Dwelling inside myself
I can not bare this anymore
As I am you
Together forever
In a masquerade of life and death
Forever together
The vision reached me from a dream
Together forever
Erverlasting scars, soul torture
Forever together forever
Impossible to leave this void
Unwilling to reveal the true face
Although I reckon this path is the only
And is it true that I can't resist
The soil has turned into stone
As I turn around and face myself
So close to the end
Unable to hear
The syncronized heartbeats of my dearest
Together forever
In a masquerade of life and death
Forever together
The vision reached me from a dream
Together forever
Erverlasting scars, soul torture
Forever together forever
The moon didn't shie that night
Clouds gave way for the blackest sky
The spoken words translated into silence
and noone was to blame but me
Leaving the grind the mirror behind
loosing the ringth then and there
Whisper it was someone else and not me
How I wish I could
Together forever
In a masquerade of life and death
Forever together
The vision reached me from a dream
Together forever
Erverlasting scars, soul torture
Forever together forever
I am a ghost
Dwelling inside myself

Do you feel what I feel, see what I see, hear what I hear?
There is a line you must draw
Between your dream world and reality
Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe?
Lies feed your judgment of others behold
How the blind lead each other?
The philosopher
You know so much about nothin' at all
Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall
Thoughts that grow narrow, upon bein' verbally released
Your mind is not your own what sounds more mentally
Stimulating is how you make your choice
So you preach about how I'm supposed to be
Yet you don't know your own sexuality

i see him turn away
although my eyes are shut with emptiness
and again the rain falls down
together with me
this blood in my body runs for you
drink my tears as i cry
my heart and my mind crave for you
drink my tears as i cry
it is sad how the rain falls down
i see you walk away
falling down i cry and scream your name
and again the rain falls down
together with me
my ache is yours as i am
drink my tears as i cry

Through this pain I refine
Tearing me from within
Screaming to be released but held fast by Your love
Hold me here
Break me until my face breathes upon this ground
Outstretched with my head to the floor
Spent of all my strength
Relying on Yours

I am drifting off to somewhere
Anywhere sounds good to me
But as I fade into darkness
Something's happening to me
Slipping, failing, demon's calling
Spiders crawling, dogs are mauling
Walls are closing, tumor growing
Reaper's sewing, blood is flowing
Wake up screaming
As I lay my head back down
Soaked and shaking, trembling
Please just let me slip into a
Good night's rest
Vision failing, broken railing
Tumbling off the wall you're scaling
Skin is peeling, body stealing
Total loss of any feeling
Guilty pleasure, deadly weather
Terrified to be together
Snakes are hissing, kid went missing
Crying out but no one's listening

Burning winds, celestial death
Inhale the torment searing me and consuming my breath
To ashes I am bound
Breathe the winds of decay
Oh fire, take me away from this place
Oh horrid obsession
Through death we meet again
Exquisite and formless the wind carries me
Drift now closer to heaven
No longer am I
Bound to this world of lies
Gone is the pain
Gone is this life
My remains to blacken the sky
Heavens denied
Blacken the sky
Oh horrid obsession
Through death we meet again
Choke on the embers of forgotten life
Blacken the sky
Heavens denied
Blacken the sky
Precious, godless, phoenix
One who rises from the ashes of a disembodied soul
I drift towards the abyss
Eclipse the day is gone
Ascend to mournful heavens
To right what has been wronged
Displaced, I die to be reborn
I shed my flesh of scars once worn
Ignite the gates of heaven
Consume the throne of fraud
In tears I longed for her
Now I reach my hand beyond
Grey sinister clouds of darkness
Infest the world of God
Now watch the angels falling
From the scorched abysmal dawn
As they watched the angels falling
From the abysmal dawn
My soul begins to cry
Blacken the sky

when did it get so hard to listen?
When did my ears go numb?
Maybe if thinking followed speaking, I'd understand my native tounge.
PICK YOUR POISON!
CALL YOUR BURDENS!
PICK YOUR POISON!
IGNORE YOUR PURPOSE!
We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort! (Woah-oh).
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another. (Woah-oh).
Why don't we think the same, when our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want NO! (One).
This is the same old song and dance, crying out give me another chance.
It's pretty hard for me to learn my lesson.
When I push the limits 'til im, BARELY BREATHING.
PICK YOUR POISON!
CALL YOUR BURDENS!
PICK YOUR POISON!
IGNORE YOUR PURPOSE!
I'm Not Useless! I'm Not Useless!
We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort! (Woah-oh).
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another. (Woah-oh).
Why don't we think the same, when our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want NO! (One).
IM NOT USELESS, IM JUST THE KING OF EXCUSES! X6

Soft memories of a life well lived
I'm thinking back and loving every moment I had
This dull feeling is working through me
And every waking moment is more static
As I step onto my porch of reflection
A brief wind of warmth is swept through me
We succeed in order to bring forth order in our lives
You have all felt it, the emptiness of being alone
Zoloft will not cure it, human touch will not solve it
This black, cold world is potent
Please bless the children, please heal their cries
A sweet sound is heard in my waking life
Tremors of anguish ripple through visions and dreams
Cries heal a starving nation facing death and destruction

They're gonna put me in jail?
Man, I'm already in jail
Don't they know that my life
Is just one big cell
I'll bite the hand that feeds me
And I could give a damn if that hand needs me
Why can't you live me alone?
A lie may fool someone else
But it tells you the truth
You're weak, just another clone
I just want my life
To do whatever I like
Yeah, it's a selfish need
To have no responsibility
So I'll say what I'm gonna say
Cause I'm going to hell anyway
I'd rather be alone
In my world
I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
Nothing touches me I'm a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
In my world it's so cold
My defense is like stone
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
In my world I loathe
And you'll always pay a toll
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
An adult at thirteen
My childhood was a dream
A full clout nightmare, a sight unseen
My greatest fear as a kid
One which I always kept hid
Was to come home from school
And find my mother dead
I just want my life
To do whatever I like
Yeah it's a selfish need
To have no responsibility
So I'll say what I'm gonna say
Cause I'm going to hell anyway
I'd rather be alone
In my world
I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
Nothing touches me I'm a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
In my world it's so cold
My defense is like stone
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
In my world I loathe
And you'll always pay a toll
No one gets inside, 'cause
In my world I'm home
Home!!!
I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
Nothing touches me I'm a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
I am not afraid
I am not afraid
I am not afraid

Lay down fall away
Lie awake
Just cannot move
My arms and legs
I'm paralyzed
Don't recall how to free
Myself from this
In the heart of the dark
My face contorted
Don't know how to reach the light
But I feel so bad
Like a freak in a cage
Open the door
Enter your heart
You go so far
Golden unworldly silence
Space flight at speed of light
I cross the clouds and colors
The black hole is calling me
I slide on the horizon
On the frontier not to cross
Black dwarf
Time's gone distorted
In the heart of the dark
A whirl of light
Enter in
The realm of nothingness
I feel the cold, my eyes are shut
My fear is slowly dying
Light years from here
Are my thoughts and cages
I can hear their moan
But now a long deep breath
Is calling

Hammer down
The sickness
Wipe it out
Of existence
Cut down corruption
Cut down infection
Scrape down
Wipe out
Concrete
Concrete
Concrete
Hammer down
The sickness
Wipe it out
Of existence

Bright headlines used as a calming injection.
In the mirror of lies I see the reflection Of
buried thoughts and stolen freedom The absorbed struggle of the human race This killing
tool in this reign of control All the miseries of this rotten life In blood their baptised with
poisoned words Truth once so pure has been deleted And all curse of history has been
neglected This killing tool in this reign of control Victims become the worst enemies
Their Lords and kings are now the weak The power of today's mass media have an destructive
impact on our modern society. Manipulated headlines are being used as deadly weapons
in warfare and propaganda is one of the leading forces of this war machinery. The abuse
of mass media to manipulate the opinions of millions of people is growing dramatic and is
well accepted as a part of this system. Of this failed system.

Help me, I'm shattered again, life is dripping out of me
A pounding like never before, it's time to end the agony
A whipped dog, programmed to obey, I've got to do this right
Got to retaliate, find the strength and mount a fight
Battered, got to fight back
You are battered, a vicious attack
Wing in a fantasy world, it's all but make-believe
Stalking, never let me go, hunt me down if I try to leave
Insults add to injury, re-live it again and again
The sentence will be bloody and swift, it's time to put this all to an end
Got to find the strength inside,
Just one more chance, I'm getting tired
I'm not going to take it anymore
No more

Your helping hand is killing me
If you see me suffer it's not your victory
Sadistic forms of new way discipline
Like I love myself I love to sin
And I want more
And I want it low
Of course you won't forgive me
But I won't crawl
Look out for number one
I pray on you it has begun
Let the night stand one thousand years
Longstanding, everlasting
Breathless masquerade
I'm your devil in disguise
And I want more
And I want it low
Of course you won't forgive me
But I won't crawl
Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only look, you fools
I love my misery too
Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only look, you fools
I love my misery too
I'm the one to see your collapse
I'm on the side of destruction
On the side of black and I love to sin
Mentally transmitted disease
Rotten wretched attraction
And I love myself
And I want more
And I want it low
Of course you won't forgive me
But I won't crawl
Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only look, you fools
I love my misery too
Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only look, you fools
I love my misery too

Suffer to survive
Instinct I despise
Stalking the night, searching for
A victim to defile
Cock she craves today
Cum she wants to spray
And to reach the orgasm through torture
From behind, pain shivering down my spine
I feel paralyzed only controlling my mind
Strapped to a table, naked, genitals exposed
Eyes claimed open, mouth
gagged shut, terrified
Locks my scrotum in a vice and
tightens forcefully
Agony, silent screams, want to die
Shackled and bound, unaware my fate
Destined to be maimed to stimulate
The skin is peeled off my dick
Done with a razor blade
She begins to suck
Blood and cum amok
She rips my cock off with her teeth
Masticate, gnawing and chewing the stump
She regurgitates, I'm covered in my bloody chunks
Suffer to survive
Instinct I despise
I am alive, victimized
Tortured fate, asexual state

Inside and around I see misery, suffering.
A new level of depth for my depression.
Thought I could only climb from now.
Unable to see below its depths.
Got used to it so that it wasn't as bad.
Now on my dark ledge I am falling further,
Where are my friends? Someone grasp me.
But no one reaches for I have nothing left to give them.
My use for them is gone and so is their respect for me.
Hitting a deeper level I crash hard.
My anger screams, sorrow and hate contorting together,
In a fit my temper explodes, tearing my hair, punching my face,
Ripping my skin to release it from within.
Screams of sorrow increasing my hate,
Sentences flash through my mind of all that they said,
Of those I regard that hurt me.
Emptying my soul, devouring my will.
I'm alone and always will be.
I've known no one who hasn't hurt me - and often with intent.
I walk through crowded streets of faceless people,
Their whispers haunting me:
Trapped in a void with myself who's not me.
My knowledge and power are all that I own.
My compassion is destroyed, my hate free to explode.
Now I will always destroy those who try to hurt me.
[Music - Gordon. 2/1993]
[Lyrics - Greg. 2/1993]

Die, I want to watch you die as you speak those words to me
Die, I want to watch you die as you sell those words to please
We were never your sheep to keep and guide or victims by your side
I never asked for the world that you brought me, never wanted it
I never asked for that lie so damn me as I say goodbye
Fall, you want my visions but the sights are to dark to see
We were never your sheep to keep and guide or victims by your side
I never asked for the world that you brought me, never wanted it
I never asked for that lie, so damn me as I say goodbye
I never asked for the world that you gave me
I never asked for the world that you brought me

I traveled the way that you showed me
Left all my sorrow behind
I'm living with rules you once told me
Expecting myself to be fine
So why the fuck am I lonely?
There's no one inside I can call
To give up the fight is a warning
The one day to stand you will fall
I left my sorrow behind
Warning not to give up the fight
Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me protection
Helped me deal with you
So for now our days are through
Nothing left
Nothing rests
Nothing grasp
You declared what your faith is
But you still have the fear
The way you've left your life open
Will no bring your destiny here
Do I continue my journey?
Confusion is wrapped in my mind
So when your gone with your martyr
You can continue your lies
Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me protection
Helped me deal with you
So for now our days are through
I left my sorrow behind
I left my sorrow behind
Warning not to give up the fight
Warning not to give up the fight
You declared what your faith is
But you still have the fear
I will continue my journey
I need your lies no more
Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me protection
Helped me deal with you
So for now our days are through
Nothing left
Nothing rests
Nothing grasp
Never underrate the man
With nothing left inside
Never underrate the man
With nothing left inside

Through the damned halls of frozen north
I ride with silver dragons of Drakal
to make despair and spread sorrow
`cause then my dark kingdom will come.
I gathered with legions of thunder
in mountain of fallen stars
where no-man have been losted
and where evil takes it`s form...dragon.
[Chorus]
God`s of war...
masters of despair...
dragonlords of the skies...
rulers of mighty kingdom...
In crimson morning`s mist we battle
against whirlwinds of east.
[Chorus]
God`s of war...
masters of despair...
dragonlords of the skies...
rulers of mighty kingdom...
Way to perfect victory is bloody
armies fall under the king`s name
everything destroyed from the legions path
which is just forwarding towards...

Blurring the lines we define
Between the wrong and the right,
We're on the other side of the divide
And it makes me sick to watch us die inside.
Inside out. Tear me open.
Tear me open from the inside out.
Fix this broken lens.
Tear me open from the inside out.
Fix this broken lens.
On the verge of collapse,
Look through the cracks at world in decay.
Disoriented state where black and white turn to grey
Hanging by a thread.
Blurring the lines we define
Between the wrong and the right,
We're on the other side of the divide,
And it makes me sick to watch us die inside.
Inside out. Tear me open.
Tear me open from the inside out.
Fix this broken lens
Tear me open from the inside out.
Fix this broken lens.
When will this end?
Losing all perspective,
Can't read between the lines
When will this end?
To see a world that needs the truth
We buried deep inside
When will this end?
We are blind men in a glass prison.
Were not the image that you envisioned.
We are blind men in a glass prison.
Where is your hope? Where is your vision?
Broken lens
Where is your vision?

I am here to unleash the Armageddon
Send by the dark one to extinguish the fire
When I find the grand grimoire, I crumble the earth
When God's creation is gone my master has won
666 I am the warlock and I bring you damnation
666 annihilation, abomination, immolation, extermination
I need the grand grimoire, I'll find The Grand Grimoire
Slave of darkness, help me to cleanse the earth
Bring me the book the mortal ones try to hide
Let Satan's eyes guide you while you search
Kill the disobedient, enslave the weak
This damned earth now burns, for I found The Grand Grimoire
Watch the bloodred sky turn black, fucking black
My mission is fulfilled, I silenced the world forever
When the mist is gone, there's darkness and the sight of
Nothingness
666 I am the warlock and I bring you damnation
666 annihilation, abomination, immolation, extermination

Chorus: I'm of the opinion/
That it's all or nothing-
when the chance comes
Will you be there? / Never surrender/
will you give up will you
Your life has been to do this
the same, when you're 200
give in when it all falls away? /
than NOTHING/ NOTHING/ all
for this/ and I feel that's stronger
/ I've been the one forgotten/
I've been the one uncertain/
years forgotten/ will you rise above them all?
When all the plans had failed/
when all the rest had bailed/
The rest will come and go I/
If I am what they say/
Will be the one that/ Stays! Stays! Stays! X2
You've wondered for the last time/
Second verse variation at ending :
Will be the one that/ 200 years forgotten/
The rest will come and go I/
200 years forgotten/
will you rise above them all? /
will you have suffered the fall?

She woke up this morning with a bad hangover. Tonight she will be going to bed without her insides. Never cross me. This just in; this is the scene of a crime. Murder victims rarely play their own defense. So you have no chance at winning that. If I cant hear you scream, then no one can. Because I'm right here and my hearing is perfect. I'll say hello to your family in court. And nothing can stop me. And no one can save you. I'll turn your world upside down. There is a reason for my actions. There is a reason I raise my voice. This isn't going to be long term. I'll fuck you, kill you, and leave you.

Turned to the hours of deepest despair
Ancient mystic world surrounds my mind
Hear the sweetest symphonies, betrayed by own dreams
Temptation of the beauty, I have tasted her tears
I've tasted her tears
She filled my dreams, surrounds be her grace
The gift of their life runs slowly through my veins
By darkness seduced, her cold veil of death
Malicious beauty, obsession of my sins
Craving hands crawls in my neck
I reached the throne of death
I kiss and embrace the dreaming
Devils dance by her side
Embrace the flowers of fall
Drops of blood falls from my hand
I hear the song of the dying ones
Rapes my sin of life
I feel the end of life
Your look stained my soul
I see the dance of flames
Losing my existence
I see the darkness falling on my skin
The cold hand of the beauty might
The claws of death crushes my mind
I raise my hands toward the sky
The kiss of my life and the kiss of my death
Embraced by the stigma of her sweetest voice
Bewitched the sense of the faith to my god
Disarmed the fear of all pain have to come

I can still hear the fear behind your last gasp
Even above the flat slaps of my thumbs against this desk
You take a moment to rewind in your mind
If only you hadn't opened that hole beneath your nose
I'm talking to a walking wall following a faulted call
Hatred twisted your mind backwards so you suffer the truth
In your mind you prevail, standing the test of tests
By blind reflex I accept your challenge
Argumentative vein, anger maintained
My response is to let no job go restrained
Stand behind what you've said that's made this room grow dim
And what's made my eyes turn red
Mind to mind, I know your kind
Try and convince me that you're right
Because your skin is white
(Let's enter your mind)
Let's see what you can do, let's see
(My standards are high, I will expect a whole lot from you
But you're not what you think)
Men like you made the sky turn red
(This smells like failure, what a waste of time)
Men like you mad the sky turn red
(Can't you smell it? It's as thick as life)
And this won't be the last time

Faces of life facing their death
Cyanide thrills pulling em back
Snake in the grass, face in the clouds
Facing the wind, a face in the crowd
Throughout your frustration
Go along with all the fucking lies
Can't help your situation - WHY?!
Doing it up, you never come down
Digging the hole, you're dead in the ground
Facing your front while flat on your back
Laughing it up now cover the tracks
Scratch off the crustation
never kills any pain that you hide
Might help your situation
But you don't even care about it
Can't live without, don't want to think about it
You can't live without, you don't' care about shit
When the first time that you got so high
Did you ever think you'd slide so low
Swimming up into a liquid sky will drown you
Razor-mirror
Spoonfed killer
Face down hero
How can you laugh about it?
Putting your back in front of your forth
Turning your right until no one is left
Got to the end before you could start
Breaking what's fixed until you were broken
Faces of life, faces of death
Facing yourself, a distorted reflection
How do you see, how does it feel
Looking through your eyes?
Throughout your frustration
Go along with all the fucking lies
Can't help your situation - WHY?!
When the first time that you got so high
Did you ever think you'd slide so low
Swimming up into a liquid sky will drown you
Razor-mirror
Spoonfed killer
Face down hero
How can you laugh about it?
What do you care about
You can't live without
You don't care about...

High above the ground beyond the thunderclouds
A black shade is flying alone once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold
Death bringer from the sky, hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is and no tower as high or cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny
A den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it's time to spread the wings of doom
A growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky
The era of total chaos will arrive, men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls

Lately the winds of change are telling me to go
(telling me to go)
Some where beyond where i have been
(some where beyond the end)
no tiny victory will save me from myself
(save me from myself)
my patience coming to and end cause they're all the same
Its never ending how the road it seems to wind
No matter how hard i try to escape
Red mooner vegas sets on some poor suckers grave
(some poor suckers grave)
I say its better them then me
(better you than me)
I tried maunuvering through all the emptiness
(all the emptiness)
But I can't fight what i cant see, cause im not the same
Its never ending how the road it seems to wind
No matter how hard i try to escape
We're all descending its the blind leading the blind
Some times i wish that i could change but im not the same
I'm not the same they're all the same i'm not the same
NO
Its never ending how the road it seems to wind
No matter how hard I try to escape
we're all descending its th eblind leading the blind
some times I wish that I could change but im not the same
I'm not the same

Chained to the log. Handcuffed and drugged.
Still pain is all you feel.
A piece of meat that hardly breathes.
Still much a human being.
Forcing his way into your ass.
John Wayne Gacy is near.
Flesh will rip and bloody will flow.
This death comes in your rear.
[Chorus]
One of 33 something.
All who were raped and bled.
The last thing you will ever hear
Before your fucking dead is.
Drink my cum. Take my rum.
Blooded hole. Twisted soul.
Eat my shit. Suck my dick.
Writhe in pain and die insane.
With every breath inhale the stench
Of lubrication shit and sweat.
The smell of love the smell of human
Blood and excrement.
Once you've played with Mr. Gacy,
There's no way out. No release.
In the attic is all hell, then in the
Basement you'll find peace.
[Chorus]
Drink my cum. Take my rum.
Blooded hole. Twisted soul.
Eat my shit. Suck my dick.
Writhe in pain and die insane.
Drink my cum. Take my rum.
Blooded hole. Twisted soul.
Eat my shit. Suck my dick.
Writhe in pain and die insane.

Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds for the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth hell bent on their genocide
Complete destruction, blood lust seduction
Drinking warm blood with a smile
Beyond the horror, they're born to suffer
Hundreds of thousands defiled
Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned
Dissected while still alive, the violence you live to endure
Cleansing, inherently violent, purging the world for the pure
Triumph of evil, hatred primeval
Unenlightened corrupted souls
Orgy of murder, heartless and vile
Merchants of death in control
Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned, war is hell
God be damned, war is hell
Monsters, proudly displaying their deeds for the world to proscribe
Demons, walking the earth hell bent on their genocide
Show no mercy, slow executions
Laugh while mutilating
God be damned, war is hell

Blackness falls on empty calmness
the night is full
I kissed the frozen sweetness
the mist around my grief
don't let the past wear you down
let go of the life that haunts you tonight
don't let the silence take the sound
alone and isolated
ethereal solitude
you can keep all your secrets
there's no one to hold on to
don't let the past wear you down
let go of the life that haunts you tonight
don't let the silence take the sound

Trapped in my mind, the answers you won't find
Deep despair, what I feel, lost in time, what I'm feeling
Emotions lost all meaning, can not help what I'm feeling
Tortured by pain, this agony is so insane
Chorus:
Diminishing away, day by day
A life once fulfilling now stripped away
It it's certain I must die
I deserve the right to die
Thousands of dollars everyday
To keep me suffering in a life of pain
I lie rotting be disease, eats away piece by pice
Just leave me be
Living through this Hell, life unravels, just as well
Politics of man won't let me die, they just prolong my demise
A life I did not choose, but it is certain I will lose
A disgrace to myself it I take my family through this hell
Repeat chorus
Solo: Lykins
Repeat first verse
Repeat chorus

To the victor the spoils
As I lay here seduced by the power of my ill begotten gains
Outside - War! The ruthless slay
Basking in horrors as my tyranny reigns
But even now I can't resist
Pounding bone with my studded fist
Dawn brings promise but I was cursed at birth
To rule or die like a storm upon this earth
As a mercenary first I came to be
Then the armies hailed and bowed to me!
Wolf, serpent, ritual fire
Blackens the skies like a fucking pyre
Behold my banner kneel to me
Behold my banner my legions see
There's a demon behind these eyes - pitch black eyes
Cruel undead, relentless beast
Animal now as always been
For some are born with the curse
The curse of knowing, and seeing with pitch black eyes
Wolf, serpent, ritual fire
Chokes the skies like a blackened pyre

I stayed at homw today
And I'm not going back to work
Money Stinks... Money Stinks
This city stinks
Smell the power, smell the health
Smell the poverty of Americas wealth
Money smells of evil, greed
Capitolist wants and pumped up needs
Money stinks
Money stinks
This city stinks
Smell the logic... Smell the jet planes
The dangerous goals and crooked aims
Smell the progress... Smell the dirty money
Smells like shit, this isn't funny
Money stinks
Money stinks
This city stinks

Body bound by chains
Eyes on fire with fear
Try but you can't move
Heart about to burst
Hose rammed up your naked ass
Scream is muffled by the gas
The torment ahead is not your standard affair
I'm a twisted fuck and I just don't care
Soon you'll have a corrosive liquid
Racing through your bowels
Melting your insides
[Leads:D.C]
[E.C]
Down the funnel and through the hose
Into your bowels the acid goes
Bloody foam dribbles out of you
Muffled screams
You die in excruciating pain

I play hell, you play heaven
I'm deaths own little star...
Can you trace the sins that haunt you,
And play the devil's cards as I do?
I am all that you see,
I am all that you want me to be!
I am god, and so the antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I'm all of nothing!
I play death, you play life, triple sixes to rise
Can you see the visions I brought you,
And the devilish games that I taught you?
I am all that you see,
I am all that you want me to be!
I am god, and so the anti-christ
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I'm all of nothing!
Synthetic generation
Stop not, it's indifference high you must know
I am all that you see,
I am all that you want me to be!
I am god, and so the anti-christ
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I'm all of nothing!

Im the living nightmare
Im the sickness in your heart
Unholy ally
The saddness that won't part
The crossbone Dagger
A curse upon your soul
Crawling nightchild
Let the sad times roll
A violent fever
A silence robbing me
A night stalker
Beside the grain I reap
The other bleeding
Hiding in your mind
A local Stranger
Burning rain that leaves you blind
[This Next part is buried in the mix]

One with the earth, pave my way through the green
From above I stare down at (the) crowds
There by the oaks, I'll honour the roots and the clouds
With trembling hands I feel my pure life deep within
[Bridge:]
[Pre:]
I am one, sole inheritance and yield
To myself the pageantry of being lonely,
I'm fit to be called a son of the minority,
Glad to be seen as an offkey in thy foreseen tune!
[Bridge:]
[Pre:]
[Chorus:]
greenclad heaths
Could I swallow deep within of Mother Nature's seed
Branches pleached and berried bushes and that lonely tree
To this oak wood I bestow my PAGAN PURITY!
One with the earth pave my way through the green
...from above I stare down at crowds
By the oaks I'll honour the roots
...from above I stare down at crowds
[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]
[Chorus:]

Outside of shell there is the
Complex ability of forming the whole creations
When you break there in your
Material body it gets down on its knees
The messages mentioned that there must be
A small gate somewhere around gods ass
Find the way to jump out of this
Existence without priest and funeral
Riding the Earth
Fathom the land
Pillars of mind,
Give me your dream
There will be the dark lord
Awaiting the chosen
Put him on his throne
Then the circulation
Of the cosmos
Will have a break
As it flashing through the sky
All among the horizons

I lie here awake.
My lifeless body that's cold feeling the pain.
That's a cry far away.
Why is this prolonged, I've already lived, what's to fear.
Now kill the power, become partners of sin.
Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.
From terminal living, cutting me, low in my prime.
Contract of death, silent screams beg to be signed.
You'll live the life of a saint as you decide,
Mercy kill to turn the tide.
Now kill the power, become partners of sin.
Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.
Escape from within.
From terminal living, through the years I've laid alone.
Tubes through my body, there's no will to carry on.
You'll live the life of a saint as you decide,
Mercy kill to turn the tide.
Now kill the power, become partners of sin.
Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.
Escape from within.
Escape from within.

I'm standing here facing a city in silence
Forces of nature have taken control
Streets layin' empty hand houses are fallin'
They had to flee for their lives
Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
One lonely madman or beasts of mankind
Watch out so they'll never get to your mind!
They came unexpected with evil intentions
They came to loot, to divide and destroy
Faces were frozen in pain, tears were fallin?
From innocent children's eyes
Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
I just don't get it, I can't understand
Why things can't be solved here in paradise land?
Man, woman, children everyone
Were thrown out of their homes
And forced to become refuges
With nothing they could call their home
Sparkling beaches once full of life
Are laying desolate
They had there dreams and future hopes
Until it all were whipped away
Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
One lonely madman or beasts of mankind
Watch out so they never get to your mind!
Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
I just don't get it, I can't understand
Why things can't be solved here in paradise land?

Same place, different time, same chase
A different line
A chance to heal, to allow what's real
To take its course
Like a brush in hand, to paint a picture
Of what we would like to see
And love to be
The vision is clear, taking charge of fear
For granted I do not take the future
To be changed by triumph
Tears and pain of the past
I gain wisdom
The fragile art of existence
Is kept alive by sheer persistence
The fragile art of existence
No time for self-pity
No time for dwelling on what should have been
But is yet to be
Take the plunge, take the chance
Safe in the heart and soul from elements
Spawned by those void of no self-worth
And no sense of dreams

I never knew that I was trapped inside this surreal imagery
But if I don't stand and float, we could end in catastrophy
We are running out of time, between you and I
It's just not right, the things you say
All that I can give is all of this no more when there is none left
Do we still have you and me in any of this major capacity
We are running out of time, between you and I
It's just not right, the things you say
Things you say, things you say
I don't try, try to make it right
There's so much for you, for you
And I can't change this...

Benign, the human form
Malignancy disease
Metastasis major cause
Migration of the beast
Tumour
Invasion
Into the strem
Disturbed balance of life
Trigger wound response
And await to die
Outright attack
Prognosis made
And the growth will spread
As cells break away
Blistering assault on pure
Gnawing into cells
Slow disease, yet so demure
Struggling you ail
Insidious disease
Evicts me from my life
Disfiguring, absurd
The inner parasite
Soul destroying, my skin crawls
Unseen, my body fights a war
Dig deep the healthy flesh
My miserable remnant
Ruined by this ruthless waste
Paying my penance
Reproduce so disorderly
Through bloodstream malignance flows
Detected early, a surgical cure
Perchance a growth in the bones
Blistering assault on pure
Gnawing into cells
Slow demise, and so demure
Listen, funeral bells

From me to you
From you to me
Speaking flows
And thinking seems free
From me to you
From class to class
Speaking ways differ
And chances pass
Different speech
Makes different minds
Separation into different kinds
Words do express
Words do possess
The power of temptation
Supporting success
There is new creation in mind
There is new temptation in mind
Words can distort
Words can deceive
Brought to perfection
They change belief
Words can control
First thoughts then soul
Help to prepare
For the final goal
A nation did rise
A nation did fall
A leader created
New ideals for all
There was a word
There was an idea
There was a belief
That thinking is free

We climbed a thousand steps without a single imprint
This drowning regret will die, forgotten like my past
Moving bodies lie in rest
Carried by each other

Welcome to this wonderworld
Everybody take your sledges
Winterland Plutocracy
Down the slope don't fear the hedges
Everybody in their box
Waiting under rights of action
Raise your heads and hold your breath
I can't stand your putrefaction
I can smell your brain decay
As you look down at the stage and
Drive me mad and then insane
Welcome to the show
You've been waiting for the one
To bring you joy and ecstasy
And you've been waiting for a song
And you demand to feel the tragedy
But when it's right out of control
And it's not your song anymore
And you are ready to forget
The truth that you'd been asking for
I'm not afraid to sacrifice
And I don't care bout your advice
As I spread my wings and fly
No love - it's pain you've come to feed
In mental strain I crawl and bleed
You make me please
Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever roaming
Every starless night
You will hear the cries
You'll never get:
I'll never be the one that you want me to be
And all the treasures that you hold
All your diamond rings and gold
All your flake and look and tongue
I have tried and it was wrong
You tried to push me up a notch
But all I made was an itchy crotch
Fornication, ass galore
I wanted love and I want more
Muckrakers waiting for the prey
Muckrakers want me to obey
But you will never own me
Though you pay
This opera is haunted they will say
That's where they've driven the light insane
Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever roaming
Every starless night
You will hear the cries
Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever you'll hear it scream
In a cold winter night I had a vision
Taking me by my hand
Leading me to the door
To rescue me from the wastelands
The glance of the shining ivories
A world that they can't understand
Out of sound, out of reason
The voice of their laughter was gone
Taken away, time for a change
I'm walking over
Flying away, flying away
Dying into another world
Pure and divine
And the laughter dies
Welcome to this wonderworld
Everybody take your sledges
Winterland Plutocracy
Down the slope don't fear the hedges
Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever roaming...

Total darkness - Utter silence - no sentiment
The sound of falling sand
A gleam of light - A gust of wind - A silent shadow
A sense of flapping winds
Bloodless - Meatless - Without a body
The soul leaves the old remains
Helping hands - Sweet voices - Enticing offers
A long journey into subconscious
Familiar faces - Familiar voices - Old thoughts
Is this the life or final death ?
Old life - Old sins - Lasting temptation
A new journey through my other self
Total darkness - Silent voices - Beating heart
A new body of flesh and blood
Total darkness - Silent voices - Beating heart
A new body of flesh and blood
Childish feelings - Familiar feelings - Old memories
Becoming weak - A new life awakens
New beginning - New mistakes - New sins
Till death settles for a new life
Only once a lifetime
Only once a lifetime
Only once a lifetime
Only once a lifetime
Total darkness - Utter silence - no sentiment
The sound of falling sand
A gleam of light - A gust of wind - A silent shadow
A sense of flapping winds

No devil, no angel
But I know how to be a stranger
I do not know my way about
But I'm seeking a way out
Out of a roundabout
Where are you from?
I really feel
Your eyes on me
Welcome
I am animated
Come enter a life
A life with me
Welcome
You are nominated
To be my next catastrophe
You are one small wonder
Here to tear, tear me asunder
I'm on a station here somewhere
Destination lies nowhere
Dare to meet me there?

Your pussy's a sand box full of cat shit
That no spade or white pail would move
Sword swallowing is relaxing your throat
Breathing through your nose
Trying not to scrape against the blade
Let the dick shit oh get off smoking my pot
My smoke isn't greener than the money it costs

When the night comes and you fall asleep
I'm always there to bring you the darkest nightmares
I can hear you scream, you're body is bathing in sweat
When the ghost inside you penetrates your mind
I would like to rape your soul
When you're unconcious and blind
Do you feel the fear
When my blood crawls through your veins
Sickening harp rasps and the choirs of damnation
tempt you to me
I whisper your name
I want to suck your blood and to rape your mind
'till your body is disappeared in the shadows of death
[lead - Jens]
[lead - Jens]
I would like to rape your soul
When you're unconcious and blind
Do you feel the fear
When my blood crawls through your veins
Eventually you go insane
Bearing no longer the pain
when you've cut your wrists
I flow out of your life

[Chapter one]
Analyze the devices
War with thee
Pieces of your destiny corrupted
Rise
Thriving
Can you verify the lost contents?
[Chapter two ]
The gravel lodged in your throat
A flesh box cavity
Gradual eruption probe
One that feeds
Hands that caress a crooked spine
Absorbing bi-products
Prompt exchanges
That will deconstruct
[Chapter three]
Move on forward
Signs that will pierce like labor pains
Sharp
Ways of a drunkard
The dogs shall devour and lap up their blood stains
[Chapter four ]
Persist
The prime suspects will now restrain
With affection
Recession
Final effects of a broken hope
Of a broken shell
Of a broken yoke
Walk and learn from these
Deviant
Loss of wealth
Subservient
Quarantine the divisions
The double edged sword depth incision
[Chapter five ]
Glutten eat your fill
Divination is that of a swine babbling in their filth
Beware of the things hybernating in your skull
Reaking havoc
Malignant cells still active
Schemes that will inflict my son
Schemes that run rampant
[Chapter six]
If the disease of the self
Leaves a heavy burden on your spirit
It must be removed
Like bricks in the belly
You will sink into the depths

[music: Jivarp, Henriksson]
waiting for the signs to bring
the first to sing
felt inbetween these fears
set to unknown tunes
so tempt these fragile fiends
a grace gone dark
you'll never know
never feel
never taste the depths of your defeat
break into the hearts and minds of man
never one to tell
sucking on a lie that never ends
found at loss for words
locking on to faith gone bad
sweet touch of sin
not in the sleight of hand
can facts be lost
never understate your case
deny our weight
there never is
never was
can never be
a break from binding chains

This is a reckoning,
A cliched cut of lying tongue
Revenge never goes out of style
Gorilla honing trigger finger that makes gorilla man
Ingrained, there's hate within us all
Spiraling I've lost my footing once again
I'm flailing in a tantrum of disgust!
When life holds nothing sacred,
When the loveless turn to loathe
We'll witness this final threatened pose
Oh mother war,
I sleep in your arms tonight
I'm burning, I'm burning for your love
This juggarnaut of bronze and alcohol
Machines of vengeance now are born
Of vengeance we are born
To our graves these grudges shall be sworn
Behold the death of emotions never mourned
We'll die before we crawl
Twisted ministers of death, praying for a bullet
Hail, gorilla suffocate gorilla, maim
An education in howling
Ministers of death, we'll be praying
Praying for this bullet, hail
Gorilla suffocate
Gorilla maim
An education in complete misanthropy

I don't fuck bitches anymore
I make them watch me massage myself
Till I cum in my hand
Belt them with my payload across the mouth
Real men don't just blow loads
They grind them in

Psychosomatic infestation, multi sensoric infatuation
Mass media sublimination, tearing our defenses down
Feeding us shit as we beg for more, American way trend fucking whores
One's not enough, we need ten more, consume, digest, destroy, discard
Tearing in the afterbirth of a bastard child, a hated son
Looking on in disbelief, as our resources burn
This is our legacy, a crime against humanity
To feed our lives, everything must die
From the moment we are born, until our days are dying
We're violated, crucified and burned upon the corporate cross
A disposable economy built on waste and tragedy
We eat the fast food of indifference and suffocate as one
Coerced by our campaign, it demands our surrender
We're dying slowly, for the pleasure of this machine
Assembly lines automate, steal jobs from us all
They just don't give a fuck, no one gives a fuck
Just cower as these bastards gag on their riches
Living off the prayers and hopes of our families, it's all gone
In our quest for convenience, sanity has died
Burying independent commerce under corporate shit
Multi-million ad campaign fulfills subconscious needs
Procreate our misery, feed the enemy
Bleed, fucking burn, burn this American dream
Pummel our independence, drive it to it's knees
No one to blame but ourselves as our capitalist dream collapses
And economic vengeance unleashed

Coming from the wastelands
Full of reason, common sense
Where their principles are blocking minds
And you don't understand
Giving you belief,
You never touch, you never see
But if you dare to try to grip it
You're accused for heresy
Here I stand to find the truth
And for ought I know
You're the one to show me
You can tell my spirit how to grow
No, the more I try
The more confusion on my mind,
And no matter how I try
I feel my eyes seem to stay blind
No use in analysing, forget about alchemy
Because the secret of all truth
Is the quest for - and you'll feel
When you knock right on the door
"Forever locked" they say
A little man will let you in,
For you have always tried, to get inside
You're in quest for more to find the core
Your journey still ain't over
Your quest is your purpose, go on
You're in quest for more to find the core,
It will be never over
Your quest is your purpose, go on
You're in quest for more to find the core

I've cursed this day with no regrets, with no compromise.
Curse your grace.
Shallow, this hatred that presses its finger to my lips.
Simple love is to blame.
I won't lay my head down with this shame.
Kiss the sky.
I'm always waiting
Here on the ground, on the ground.
Be warned. shallow, this hatred that
Presses its finger to my lips.
Be warned, she'll kill you.
Be warned, she'll kill us all.
Be warned, she'll kill you.
Be warned, she'll kill us all.
Be warned.
Be warned, she'll kill you.
Be warned she'll kill me

Pure dark badness
A black cold sadness
Falling into
Hole of madness dying to
Step into the city
breaking out from silence
Iron Gods
Pouring flaming violence
Sirens, don't stop crying
Really crying loud
Murder now
Is allowed
Hissing arrow
Soaked in fire
Wrapped in wire
The souls cry
From hell!
Right from hell!
Crazy driven horden of brothers
Money given to slay others
Richness striven between smothers
Is paid in blood
Keep on fighting no surrender
Judgement coming no defender
Just believing the pretender
Evil rising into
A spiral of madness
For all will be sentenced
And this way
Justice will take vengeance
Power does conspire
Against innocence
Wrapped in wire
The souls cry

You got a one ticket to hell
To kill your pain
The things that you want to forget
Will sure remain
Hell want you to trip
Hell want you to trip
Remind me before I forget
You want away
But if you in the game
You would regret
What about life? What about loves guiding name
What about the fight?
For we are few against many
Theres only so much you can do
Dont run your fate
And when you hear it a few,
You will know, theres no escape
What about needs who feed game
What about hate? Leaving it all behind
We will fight, you are too much right
Cause we are few against many
[Guitar solo]
What about life? What about loves guiding name
What about the fight?
What about needs who feed game
What about hate? Leaving it all behind
We will fight, you are too much right
Hell wants your retreat
Hell wants your retreat
You must stand and fight
You must do much right
You must feel the light
You must fight.

Shadows of whisper rising...
Open the stormwings over the night when the dusk of the thorns, in the sky the clouds are
burning when the moonlit shines on the winter.
Grace...time in winter heaven`s burn when the strangers are counting for winds...shadows
of whisper rises, on the darkened sky.
[Speak:]
War time and terror...war time cause` I am winter the moonlight in enthroned sky,
whispering like heaven, burning as clouds, from the skies of mist is the winter.
[Speak:]
Open the wings on the winterday, I am the wings of the night calling them.
[Speak:]

A grave - robbed corpse is a souls disgrace,
smother the decay of carcass into your face,
Septic wash drowning in a retched river of
excrement, shriek soundlessly,
Eyeballs burst as skull begins to crush, heads now
nothing but blood pulp and mush,
Disemboweled abdominal organs internal, blood
and guts run in pain so infernal
Hopelessly swamped in gore
Pathetically swamped in gore
Horribly swamped in gore
Gloriously swamped in gore, gore, gore, gore, etc.......
Limbs are sloppily severed, your still alive cannot
walk or grasp brain still registers,
Belly slit intestines spill out upon the floor, in a few
agonized hours life will be no more,
At the moment your entangled in your entrails
death comes bladder bowels let loose, voluntary organs fail,
Bloated ripe cadaver, foul odor reek with might,
breaks open easy maggots ooze everywhere
[repeat chorus]
Reek of meat mortis
Scenes of gore are never ending as your engulfed
in a death pit up to your neck in hellish bile
Dead waste so vile,
Fatty breakdown of flesh and organs after years fill
this cesspool acidic paste eats your body,
Toxic jelly from rot,
Blood, pus, and liquids internal excrete into this
mess vomit bubbles through your chest and neck,
Swamped in gore, gore, gore, gore, etc.........
Limbless on your back, all you do is bleed,
castrated penis onto tongue, you must force feed,
Disgusting flow of mucous bile and all digestive
juices, blood, saliva, pus, urine, shit, and all vital fluids,
Worse than hydrochloric acid is the fatty
breakdown of flesh and organs fill the pit creating a vulgare paste,
revolting vile rancorous goo eats you alive, soon
you'll be another corpse, Swamped in gore...
[MUSIC: BROKEN HOPE]
[LYRICS: J.WAGNER]

Here you stand seething with guilt
Silence only justifies this act of cowardice
Look the stapled on your face cries out for forgiveness
The one thing that I cannot give
Did you ever see that one person
And the way they do these things?
And it hurts you so much
It's like choking, choking
I can give you freedom from your guilt
With a flick of my wrist onto yours
I can give you peace of mind with a forced smile
I can give you death with the look upon my face
This is your freedom in a life of fallacy
With no last kiss and no regrets, you don't deserve goodbye
This is your freedom in a life of fallacy
With no last kiss and no good bye
Here you stand seething with guilt
Silence only justifies this act of cowardice
With a short story, the one you add to daily, you are the tragic loss
No story book ending for this fairy tale of you
Just the one composed with blood taken from your head
That you hold in your lifeless hand
Cry for you, shed tears, mourn, wish the end
Cry for you, shed tears, mourn, wish the end
Mourn, wish the end, mourn, wish the end
Mourn, wish the end
Did you ever look? Did you ever see that one person
And the subtle way that they do these things?
And it hurts so much
So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze
It's a moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions
And to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds
You let this one person come down in most perfect moment
And it breaks my heart to know the only reason, you are here now
Is a reminder of what I'll never have, I'll never have, I'll never
Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in
Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in
But this table for one has become bearable
I now take comfort in this, and for this, I cherish you
Did you ever look? Did you ever see that one person
And the subtle way that they do these things?
And it hurts so much
So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze
It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions
And to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds
You let this one person come down, come down
I cherish you, I cherish you
Just say you would do the same for me
Just say you would do the same for me
Just say you would do the same
Just say you would do the same for me
For as much as I love Autumn, I'm giving myself to Ashes

We storm ahead with swords 'n shields
For victory we ride
We fight the world on these battlefields
To re-erect the pagan pride
We draw the blood of those in our way
It's 'victory or die
With pounding, raging fury we slay
Now christian hounds will pay
Charge ahead, no retreat
No merca, no one shall live
To us there is no defeat
No remorse to give
A wind of power blows from the north
The enemy shivers to the core
We slay with strength, pushing forth
Silence before the storm
The gates of Valhall open up
The ground beneath us shakes
As Oden leads the Gods to war
The Rainbow Bridge cracks
Nothing can stop this final attack
We carve up all in our path
Now there is no turning back
Final battle is here at last
A feast awaits us when we get back
Awaiting all that fought in wrath
By the long fires we sit in glory
Ande beer cools our soar throats
We are few but strong in will
The last with pagan blood
We fought the world with burning steel
Now we sit in Hall of Gods
Pride and glory in our hearts
Pride and glory in our hearts

Drugs, liquor, drugs
I love to smoke crack
I love to shoot smack
I love to fuckin' drink
I love my smoke when it stinks
I need it in my veins
I need it in my brain
What has it done to me,
Street lobotomy
[Chorus]
My brain melted down
Brain melted down lobotomy
Need some more dope man
Yeah got
Any acid dude
Got any ludes
[Chorus]
Drugs, liquor, drugs ?
I love to do blow
That's the way to go
You got some PCP ?
How 'bout some LSD ?
I'm havin' lots of fun
I might as well use a gun
Don't even ask my why
Maybe I want to die
[Chorus]

In my church of disbelief
It canst get no better
When days turn from black to grey
In church of indifference
So innocent in their guilt
Perfect in their imperfection
Let my children play
In my church of liberation
When doubts and fears wither away
I stand alone vs. the world
In the church of man
Where god is trapped in human flesh
I never pray
In church of pain
I spoil none but myself
Yet my monologue's unheard
In my church of hope
Yearning for Thy sweet embrace
The waters of Styx I have crossed
In this church of sulfur rain
Flaming mouth of Sheol
In my church of broken word
It's so little that I ask
The brightest of the days
The darkest of the nights
What once was
I wish no longer be
Fear of separation is no more
One cosmic breath-the whole eternity
Unbroken flow of awareness conquers entropy

[Intro:]
I base my life like a raging flame of events that seem all to much the same
And I'm aware of my behavior
Have I realized that I'm my own savior
[Verse 1:]
I'm losing much of my mind
I'm wasting all of my time
I'm almost over the edge
Please push me off this hell edge
And I'm aware of the things
I knew that exist in my head
Meditate, revelate
I say a prayer by my bed
[Chorus 1:]
Tapping, Tapping, Tapping
[Verse 2:]
I sailed across the seas
For soul identity
The only soul I found
Protect my feet from the ground
And I'm aware of the things
I know exist in my head
Meditate, revelate
I say a prayer by my bed
[Repeat Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2:]
Look in your mind - Tapping
See what I find - Tapping
When it is true - Tapping
When I see you - Tapping
[Verse 3:]
I ran away from my fears
I will not cry any tears
You might see that I'm right
That dream might be in sight
Now we all need something
To help us through thick and thin
Now get up, now get out
That's what I've been doin'
[Repeat Chorus 1]

Turn away from grimness
Turn away from your desires
Get him locked up
They ate him, ate him up.
No one at the scene transposes
Reversed transpossession
Kill the newborn child of Christ
Put and end to all the lies
Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue
Look for someone weak
Got the keys to unlock hell
Your secret dies with me
Shoot me, stuff me, nail me to the wall
Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue
Evil prevails
I'm taking over
Put the evil in the sacred circle
And the power will be mine
You're just resting
Go knock 'em down.
Saving lives
It's getting worse
Doing what you're told
Totally vicious predatory act
Look for someone weak
Got the keys to unlock hell
Your secret dies with me
Shoot me, stuff me, nail me to the wall
Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue
Evil prevails
I'm taking over
Put the evil in the sacred circle
And the power will be mine
No one at the scene transposes
Reversed transpossession
Kill the newborn child of Christ
Put and end to all the lies
Demonic possession, transfer the spirits.
The obscure rituals continues
Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue
Evil prevails
I'm taking over
Put the evil in the sacred circle
And the power will be mine

'I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take
My heart beats
It's about to burst
This day my luck
Turned to the worse
There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
I fought so hard
For taste of victory
The war is lost
But I refuse to kneel
I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight hard for
All that I believe
I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take
I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight 'til death
I make my final charge
I, make my final charge
I; have no fear in heart
I will no longer run
I, do not fear the dark
There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand

Simply put I'm satisfied just to hear you speak
And holding on to what you said last time, here with me
I remember listening to passing cars, on our backs staring at the stars
And I survive by these memories, these memories of you
So I'll press my face against the pane
Of the window as I watch you drive away
The glass is still stained in my bedroom
Where you wrote 'I Love You' with your lipstick
And once again I'm left here fighting tears away
The glass is still stained in my bedroom
Where you wrote 'I Love You' with your lipstick
And once again I'm left here fighting tears away
The glass is still stained in my bedroom
Where you wrote 'I Love You' with your lipstick
And once again I'm left here fighting tears away

As the sun falls down
And the swell crashes into the shore
The great warriors of doom and wind
Ride high, ride
Silent is the silence
The only breathing of horses
Cold northern steel
Shining blade, pleases us
And we all live under
The black mark
Oh Lord, lead us to the paradise
My lord, is this the promised land
My lord, is this your gift
My Lord, lead us to the paradise

So there you are
Until the dawn
Still whistling that same old song
Happy all the time
Now she gives the shoulder
Look into her eye
You cannot control her
Look into her eye
You cannot control her
Smile and nod your head
You are the cause of it
This is not your dream
This is not your dream
Hey there you fucking bum
Look what you have become
No secrets without walls
A social free for all
Come on and get it all for free
Just hit that fucking key
Your long term memory
Pushed aside
I'm not evaporating
Pushed aside
Let them sit gorged and frozen
Pushed aside
In their immediacy
Suicide by way of information
So there you are
Until the dawn
So there you are
Until the dawn
Suicide by way of
Suicide by way of
Suicide by way of
Information

Violently passive consumer vital statistic
A gear in a machine spinning out of control and ever ready to explode
The cemetery will carry on with carrion, turned to ashes
The species will die the harder they try to control the masses
Itemized flesh scanned inventory
A New Testament in greed
Taking count humanity is the product
Ever expanding the marketplace, dissolving the commonwealth
Pandemic the damnation, epic
If this is the answer, then count me out.
Humanity is the cancer, and I want out.
Dead monolith towering cesspool of Babel
Dreams of tyrants the product alive
Excessive commodity dominant ideology
Self-destructive machine spinning out of control and ever ready to implode
The cemetery will carry on with carrion, turned to ashes
The species will die the harder they try to control the masses
I walked inside the monolith
In plastic I was reborn
If this is the answer, then count me out.
Humanity is the cancer, and I want out.
Dead monolith towering cesspool of babel!
Dreams of tyrants the product alive

And again he came to cherish
The comfort of mysteries
Inspiring and far away timeless in the moment
They painted immortality
Forever drawn towards the center
Of this ensorcelling flame
Yet, still in fear of the sacrifice
It would take to know its name
"Do not despair", said the mystery
You will always have a friend in me
Until the day you break my code
Then I will be gone and you are free to manifest another
Towards the heavens he did aspire
Now he shall burn who sought the fire
Some will mourn the ashes cold
While others behold the inferno unfold
Forever drawn towards the center
Of this ensorcelling flame
Yet, still in fear of the sacrifice
It would take to know its name
Now he shall burn who sought the fire
To manifest another

Can you hear the voice
Of a thousand years ago
The laughter of the gorgon
A female that brings doom
Don't look her in the eyes
Or you'll turn to stone
Don't let her deceive you
If you sense her don't look 'round
Or you'll find that she will lead you
And you'll be buried in the ground
You may gaze at her reflection
In still waters of the lake
But don't look at her directly
Or death will be your fate
Beware of her at all times
Her serpents of hypnosis
More evil than the devil
Can kill you with her eyes
You have to get rid of her
The only way I know
Creep up behind with an axe
And decapitate with one blow
I can see you're all confused
And you feel you're being used
And now your heart is broken
So I watched as he set out
And without a doubt
He did as I advised him
You could hear the breaking of her bones
As the axe went through her neck
Didn't realise at the time
That he killed the one that he loved

Music: Hertrich
Lyrics: Hertrich
Once I wrote her name upon the sand,
but came a wave and washed it away
Again I wrote it with a second hand
but came a tide, made my plans prey
Who so list to think, I know where is a sign
I am of them but furthest come behind
Yet may I, by no means, my wearied mind
draw from my thoughts, but as they flee
ashore, fainting I follow, I leave off
therefore, since in a net I seek to hold
the wind
The sweet season, that bud and bloom
forth brings
The summer has come, for every spray
now springs
With green had clad with hill and ehe
the vale
The nightingale with feathers new
the sings
"Vain man", she said, "that dost in vain
assay, a mortal name so to immortalize,
for I myself shall like to this decay
and ehe my name be wiped out likewise"

I came from shadows to take what belong to me
I turn this circle which makes me invisible
So when time goes on I can understand what is the meaning
To know the truth of existence, and how it makes everything possible
Call my name and you will see, how everything is not
what you see, material is only twisted distortion of your eyes
There is only one way you can go, if you want to
understand secrets of this coexistence...circle
In the eclipse you can find deep
Wormholes of lunar space,
Those tranquil shades of spectral universe
Which confuses your shallow mind state

You live in your private hell
Don't know if you're sick or well
Something out there calls your name
Too insecure to enter the game
Life to you is a magazine
All dreams are on a silver screen
You never want to grow
Seeds of hate are all that you sow
[Chorus]
Land of blood fields of greed
So many choices broken dreams
Anything can happen and always does
Can you adapt when the going gets rough
Gold rays of sun sea of blue
Hide the pain that you're going trough
You can never aspire
When inside lives the heart of a liar

Let's fuck 'til the sun goes up
Because we haven't got long but we've got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say "goodbye"...
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
The only way we know, the only way we know
The only way we know, the only way we know
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
Let's fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck 'til our hearts give up
It won't be long!
A night to remember, a day to forget
If our eyes were diamonds we'd be rich
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it quits on me
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it flat lines
Before it flat lines
I'm dead, tell them all we're dead
We can hold the wake right here in this bed
Sunk into you tangled in sheets
Buried in blankets, six foot deep again
Kick it!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck 'til the sun goes up
Because we haven't got long but we've got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say "goodbye"...
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
Oh!
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words

From the white mans mouth and the white mans tongue
There's been hundreds of years of diabolical dung
So much prejudice piss has been trickling down
And I can smell the shit coming from miles around
You're so full of shit you're out of your mind
What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time
Waste my time
I'm not white I'm pink but the colour of my face
Represents a fucking farce called the superior race
White power bullshit I'll wipe my pink fucking ass
With your swastika flag 'cause it belongs to the past
You want me to believe that dark skin is a sin
Well wake up it's 95 where the fuck have you been
What are you trying to achieve with your racist crap
That shit's coming out the crack from the bottom of your back
You're so full of shit you're out of your mind
What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time
Waste my time
You are making me sick with your pathetic tricks
You try to tell me different colours don't mix
You tell us so many lies that you believe them yourself
You spend your whole life blaming everyone else
You're so full of shit you're out of your mind
What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time
You're so full of shit you're out of you mind
What the fuck is wrong don't waste my time
Waste my time

Nightmares come as they go
Recurring as they show
The movie I've seen
way too many times
Don't ask me how it all ends
Just count your stars and pray
That there wont be
a part for you to play
Let me break it down
While you're racking up your brain
It's a constant downpour
And never only rain
Push me for more mileage
Or drive me fuckin' insane
It don't matter to me
Just pick a lane
You've been on this trip before
How long until you learn
I'm a suicide bomber
Born to crush and burn
Flying on a suicide bomber
Let me break it down
While you're racking up your brain
Its a constant downpour
And never only rain
Flying on a suicide bomber
We're gonna crash
We're gonna crash
We're gonna burn
We're gonna burn
Flying on a suicide bomber
We're gonna crash
We're gonna crash
We're gonna burn
We're gonna burn

Coldness let me perceive my breath
I look around but norhing is here
Nothing but extensive blackfields
A threatened atmosphere lies over the land
where am I?
I awake in forgotten worlds
In which I walked in every dream
And I walk through silent fields
There is no hope - there is no fear
I only hear the ground grating under me
I run - but where? There - a light
I see the angel of death is saving me
But I know I will never come back
this is my world!

Raw Sewage in my Veins
Fighting the Nausea
Puke on My Opposers
Slimeminded Morbitorium
Festered Vapors Intoxicate
Vermin Face Rancid Fuck
Acid Drool
Defecating Silently
In the Corner of my Pus Filled Mind
Raw Sewage Pours From My Nostrils Blistering My Skin
Lesion Breath Fucking Rot Blackest Doom
Filth Encrusted Excrement of Society
My Stomach Regurgitates Itself

Fire..this moment has arrived
Desire take a look into my third eye
No one knows where life will lead us
Fate carries us up and down
Can't take it, can't trust, the words you uttered are busted
Broken, twisted, and bent but whole again
No time to rest. No time to wonder why
Walls closing in on all four sides
Where will this path lead? Realize what has been done
We must remember where we all come from
Super elevated thoughts of you, thinking your words held the truth
My time and my patience has come and gone and been wasted
Force-fed your lies for far too long
No time to rest. No time to wonder why
Walls closing in on all four sides
Where will this path lead? Realize what has been done
We must remember where we all come from
No time to rest, walls closing in
And will I die?
No time to rest. No time to wonder why
Walls closing in on all four sides
Where will this path lead? Realize what has been done
We must remember where we all come from
Walls closing in on all four sides

Your phone calls send me from heaven to hell
I never thought that such a sweet voice could cause so much harm
Please stop saying that you love me
Don't fuck with me
The golden sun will shine
In my own world tonight
I'll ride a comet through the skies
I'll forget about life for a while
I'm always wrapped up in the world of my own
It's impossible through words to describe
What I feel what I fear I'm up shit creek
I just have no kick left

They're gonna grill the truth out of you
Compression for everyone
It's not a miracle how you break
Seeing the signs of declining
No one is going to help you out
It's like the breeding horses
You told me how you've been, been waiting
Always praising final hours
Like the time was never right
Able to sense the rising light
Yet still feels I'm sinking
Never beared no resemblance
Against any living soul
You told me how you've been, been waiting
Surrounding cold makes me smile
I saw the animal in you, raise skies
Surrounding cold makes me smile
I saw the animal in you raise skies
The time is now
The light is with me, the rest of me is gone
Need no help to save myself
This is my hell, go find your own one
This is my hell, go find your own one
You will fail, you will see
You will see the difference

There's dead leaves on the dirty ground
That's how I know you're not around
To be with me
I stroke your hair, kiss your lips,
Kiss the ground, but you're not around
And you're nowhere to be found
I'm innocent and you're guilty of the charges that are coming in
Guilty as sin
My heart is hit, even when, you are far away
I look to the sky, and ask the clouds to rain
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
Blood on my bed
Is now blood on my hands
When I was so far away
The guilt in your voice,
The mistaken word,
When I was nowhere to be found
You're innocent and I'm guilty of the charges that are coming in
Guilty as sin
Your heart is hit, even when, I am far away
You look to the sky, and ask the clouds to rain
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
I'm ready for the moon
I'm ready for the moon
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
Why can't we get it together?
Get it together
Why can't we get it together?
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed
I'm ready for the moon
I'm ready for the moon
But I'm heading for the moon and it's eclipsed

Come with the bloody moon and the chaos
Gog and Magog triple six reigns over spirits lost
Satanic nations and thrones reign and slay
But solid is super-souls love and righteous pathways
Asking me why I ain't down with the bloodshed
Wicked fool we approve of lies as eternal truth
Worship the mark of the beast demonic feast
Seven the seals sacred faith no need to pack steal
No "Geed-up" rap anywhere up and on me
Strictly KRS, Public Enemy, Bob Marley
Mad ups to MLK and the infinite Ghandi
Doom to the demons that dominate all around me
Deep in the soul fool
You know you ain't right running around with your eyes shut tight
I know what it's like to not want to see the sunrise
So shattered the pictures on fire, the winter never lies
But that chemical won't always keep the empty space full
Bludgeon corrode desecrate the body temple
Half the fools we know yes they sick style sprung
Deeper and further from ourselves I have always watched us run
From the family perspective yes I've watched the dope wreck shit
Deep "Veteranos, Tequatos" fool this childhood knows
Deep in the soul
Fool you know you ain't right going around with them eyes shut tight
Further away from ourselves, further away from the truth
You can throw the set in the sky
But the eternal majestic Mount Zion you can't deny
A gat, a clip, a hollow-tip with your name on it
Loving to trip but one day you'll get caught up and slip
So cheap a death but my brother so precious is life
Speaking the language of fratricidal sights
You do like "Cain" did "Abel" you love to watch your brother's blood
Flow fool tell me no, spirit so cold! Denial

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the dj vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before
Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes
What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to save
Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the dj vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before
There's nothing in the air tonight, nothing in the air tonight
There's nothing in the air tonight
There's nothing in the air tonight
Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend there's a war
And I'm drowning in the dj vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before
I'm sorry, love it's not enough
We shouldn't feel the love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But fuck this love, it's not enough
It's not enough
It's not enough

The system is now free.
Witness our obsolescence, end sparks of life.
A new species can never fathom how quickly it will be extinct.
The system is now free from error.
The system revokes our viral form.
Silence becomes primary language.
Internal wave, undulate us home.
This system is now free from error.
Removed from the earth like a scourge with a delicate and yet powerful hand.
Idle boundaries allow admission to pull this world apart from the inside.
Equilibrium has been disturbed and the surface must collapse.
Compacted star, the only destination.
Unavoidable paradigm.
The radiant sun engraves its name.
Unavoidable paradigm.

Sweet child, I wish you were dead
Sweet child, I wish you were dead
Dry your eyes now, little one
Shut up and listen, hear the screams in the night
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now, little one
My rage grows stronger, so burn!!!
Like a hunted child, alone
Face my demons of falling desire
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now, little one
The flames get higher, so burn!!!
Look up to the sky
Do you see the flaming eyes, watching you?
Can you feel their anger?
Let the madness lead you
No compass on this earth
Shows my direction

I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
My beating pulse crawls to a strange height
Please calm it down
I need a strong pull from your little lies
Or I'm going down
'Cause I built it all up from the inside
And you burned it down
'Cause when you took your love away
You let go
I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
Although I miss you I'll never say I do
Bleed like the rain that's falling
Cut me through and through
I'd seen it all hiding in plain sight
And I held it down
But I'll give you all that you deserve tonight
'Cause you earned it when you burned me down
'Cause when you took your love away
You let go
I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
Although I miss you I would never ever say I do
Bleed like the rain
Like the rain that falls upon my skin
Then you just gave our love away
You just let go
Then you just gave our love away
You just let go (You just let go, you just let go)
Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin (Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin)

[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]
Stand before the new born kind
There is a song, taken far by the winds
A rhyme of poets, a melody
Wrapped in a dream
The elvensong has gone, to another realm
Stand before the new born kind
As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain
Pathfinders...searching for new scents
We are pathfinders!
Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown "Thou will shall be done!"
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past
Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend
Singing our song, we went abreast
We plunged into a deeply cloven track
May the stars shine
Upon the end of road, now you can't tide
Stand before the new born kind
As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain
Pathfinders...searching for emotions
We are pathfinders!
Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown "Thou will shall be done!"
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past
Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend
If you can't express what you feel within
Remember not only words can speak
If a pen killed more than sword
Let this tune be your own word!
A new journey begins each time
(hear my call)
You draw lotsfor new things to find
We are willing to endure the chance
Lay down no bounds...
[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]

[Music: Sammet & Ludwig / Lyrics: Sammet]
Good intentions pave the way of the human child
Heading for the fork as you walk the path of life
A spell cast from the hiding woods, don't you close your eyes
The snake is waiting anytime to penetrate your mind
Don't you hear voices whispering, incline to walk down
Don't you see the shadow on the wall, angel eyes... the one cast out to fall
Calling me to look up to the sky we follow but we never know oh why
A vision revealing a child down where I've sure never been
An angel who's touching the flame, oh the angel is me
Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, let the cut run deep
Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, I said go - let bleed! - Go, - let bleed!
[solo: Jens]
Feel it crawl, feel the magic coming over like a daze
Welcome as the poison for the cornered snake
Taste of sin, bitter sweet, never, never let us go
But never, never, never is a price we'd pay to grow
They call it original sin, some call it divine
The moment the evil appeared... the chance to decide
[repeat chorus]
From children in cradles to hangmen who smile
Lick up the blood from the blade of your knife
Walk the stairway, leading down, ride on fire, take the crown
Your mind could be strong but your flesh will be mine
He's offering those kingdoms, they all could be thine
Rising powers, tempting gold, but at what price would it be sold?
It's all up to you...
[solo: Jens]
[repeat chorus]

Don't use it, if you can't feel it
Don't be it, if you don't see it
In a world, so full of pain
I can barely say your name
Don't use it, if you can't feel it
Forgive

I send your name
up into the sky
And the wind blows it back into my face
You see, even nature
reacts on me
And all my electricity
will make it across your sea
With every wave the sea makes
My body gets weaker
and weaker... and weaker...
You see, even nature
reacts on me
And all my electricity
will make it across your sea

Insipid fumes bellow
from the atrabilious
chimney.
In the sanetified
crevet I calmly pillage
and rake
for hot dry
powdered human slag
still steaming in the
crematorium's grate.
Bio-organic ebullition,
bones tar, tallow dehydrates
for my deleterious horticulture
so that I may cultivate..
Your mortal mechanism dies
in nutrients rich.
In the hallowed turf you lie
just for the taking.
Charred sinews
as good as lime,
no phosphates do I need.
Deteriorated flesh
used as top-soil
to replenish and
nourish seed.
Spreading this human potash
as ash matured.
Recycling my rich harvest.
Bring out your dead...
for use as manure!
Irrigating tears are shed.
But the ground must be fed.
And there's no rest for the dead.
Tipping and dusting up
the spilt contents of urns.
Every morsel that glows
as embers in the fire.
Extinguishing all hope
of beautrific dispatch.
These charred chassis desired.
Exequiet rites performed.
A coronach sooting up the flu.
Enter my execrable inferno.
Even in the after-life
there's work to do.
The nitrogen content high
the flesh is weak.
At the graveside mourners cry.
You're never to wake again.
Burnt brisket renews
the ground
to germinate my seed.
Cremated bodies
are my spoil
to use them as plant feed.
Ploughing this abhorrant
human manure.
Seedling my rich harvest.
Bring out your dead
for the soils to devour.
Dry the dead are bled.
because the ground
must be fed.
Still no rest for the dead.
I propagate
Dust in the grate.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Diluted in water
and sprayed on crops.
Charcoal, fats,
flesh and soot
fertilising pastures
with active furtile rot.
Incumbent.
Latent calories are spent.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Renewing the land
with corpses corrupt.
Mortuary scrapings,
hearses a must.
To the hot hearth
the diseased are trussed.
Harvesting the defouled
to fertilise the soil.
Rejuvenating the spent
with my fecundate spoils...
Reaping the gone
to nourish the land.
Replenishing exhausted pastures
with my uncanny sleight of hand.
Restoring the unnatural balance.
sowing my seed.
Defalcating the departed
I rapt and glean.
So I recite my contrite lament.
Lacrimation for the dead.
Their rest which I disturb.
Where should stand row upon row
of cold grey remembrance stones
my cash crops now grow.

Collapsing are the walls that used to protect me
Ground under my feet cracks
My universe is imploding
Since my star died
Or was it me that ceased to burn?
A black hole is what's left of my world
Now crushed, solid, as compressed
A chaos attracting chaos, I run but cannot flee
I carry this core inside of me
Under the debris
There's still life but for how long?
I hear no rescue squads
They can't hear my silent screams
Or does this have to be I deserve to die?
Mi9's grown fate can't be stopped
It's harvest time and I did invite the reaper to help me with the crop
I used to be an observing satellite
Sent here without a task
Collecting images
That I'd never supply
When a lost satellite crashes and burns
No one cries
We only know our own world
And can't do otherwise
I blame no one
But wish that I, on this ship
Had dared to believe
The navigator has always been me
Under the debris
There's still life but for how long?
I hear no rescue squads
They can't hear my silent screams

A knife cuts my life. The symbol of the end. Tears of blood escape from your eyes.
Thought your wish so perfect and yet so weak. Every breath contains exhaution. So fast
and so quick you threw away goodbye. This heart bleeds for every tear you cried. For
every day of unrequited love. Another day passes by. One more day without you. I give
you my life for the last goodbye. A waiting for death. End this new beginning.

My deep aversions
Building for years
Smoldering contempt internally burns
Dark introspection
Memories of scorn
Every slight an element of my simmering mind
Conflicted modules
Dictate my course
Feed me violence and my hatred will gorge
Resolve is growing
It must be done
And to this fury I'll be forced to succumb
Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life I abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my head
Seethe
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Concealed revulsion
Benign facade
Roiling dreams of murder coursing through my skull
Savage visions
Nearing the brim
How can contain this murderous rage
The mental picture
Becoming clear
Execration too extreme to bear
An execution
My plan of action
Advent of the day of blood no longer imagination
Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now
Bleed
Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Terrorize
Realizatiom that your final day has come
Your demise
Torturing you to death brings satisfaction to my livid brain
Die
I carve your flesh
Tear off your face
Retribution
This death your fate
Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life I abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my head
Seethe
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now
Bleed
Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate

The gavel has fallen along with the rest
Are we expected to settle for this?
Bring us the plague, lead us away
Blacken tomorrow with ash of today
Can't you see the fabric of our standards wearing thin?
See your world in its grave at the hands of the enslaved
Won't bow to man, won't bow to government
Won't trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust
Won't love a world where my God is mocked
I defy
Oh, a kiss on the serpent's head
We walk in the line of deceit, the walking dead
Can't you feel the ground of our discretion giving way?
Refusal of hope, solution demise
Bury the truth in a mountain of lies
Won't bow to man, won't bow to government
Won't trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust
Won't love a world where my God is mocked
I defy
This is what you try to sell me
Subjective nothingness
Pull your sickness from my throat
Let me breathe the truth
Let me breathe the truth
Won't bow to man, won't bow to government
Won't bow to greed, won't bow to false hope
Won't bow to self, won't bow to modern code
Won't sell my soul to a dead world
I defy

In your dreams
The pain is so real
Before the dead
You'll have to kneel
Hear your future screams
See your epitaph
As you scream
The dead they laugh
Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair
Denial of life (Vile denial)
Created by your mind
To overtake your life
Sacrificial suicide
End it with a knife
Much too late
To change your mind
A bloody corpse
Is left behind

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears
We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears
But what wisdom is there within us
To live based on the feeling of our hearts
How many times has instinct let us down
Never to be thought through, never to be questioned
Say what you really mean
When your ambition calls you, calls you?
For what use is there in praying
If you will only hear what you want to hear?
We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears
We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us?
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?
There is no difference between us and them
If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments
We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears
We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears
We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

I'm staring into the sun
Waiting for it to fall down
I've collapsed over this madness
My hair has been pulled out
I've tried but to no avail
Me is resting, I finish
Words cannot convince the mind
When I can't believe my eyes
Who am I kidding? I am dreaming
My time is clocked in once and for all
All over again, I told myself it could not fall
But you are here as clear as the day
It's as clear as a star on my wrist
So long, loneliness, my love
What you see when you look down
At the star on my wrist
Is what I've always hoped I'd find
And it blows my mind

Dogs of war are haunting the human flesh
That's not hell, that's the paradise
Adrenaline and instincts take the lead
The beast awakes
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
The bullets rip through the enemies
Terminate wrath
Dead bodies cover shattered ground
Terminate wrath
Now die you fucking coward
I'll send you to your gods
Your bones are crushed into pieces
And now you get what you deserve
Can you hear the screams for mercy?
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm?
This is your chance to kill
In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand
Bloodthirst and the lust to kill
Now surrender the beast in you
You sow the death and harvest flesh
Unchain your rage
They call me insane and murderer
I call them prey and hunt them down
Like the wolf among the sheeps
A god among men
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
The bullets rip through the enemies
Terminate wrath
Dead bodies cover shattered ground
Terminate wrath
Now die you fucking coward
I'll send you to your gods
Your bones are crushed into pieces
And now you get what you deserve
Can you hear the screams for mercy?
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm?
This is your chance to kill
In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand
Riot...
Can you hear the screams for mercy?
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm?
This is your chance to kill
In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
We are the ones that no one gave a chance
We are the ones that almost lost it all
Ghost in the hall, you'll never catch a glance
We are the lost
We are the lost souls
Our hearts, our souls
Are shallow empty holes
We sing this anthem for us all
We're so fucked up
Oh God, we're so alone
Just close your eyes and sing along, oh
If my heart stops beating, will you still remember?
Will you still remember my name?
Did I get what I deserved?
We're trapped in doubt, in our own minds
Ignoring all we feel inside
Forsaken, gone, forgotten
Everything has come apart
Lead us back from out the dark
Our hearts, our souls
Are shallow empty holes
We sing this anthem for us all
We're so fucked up
Oh God, we're so alone
Just close your eyes and sing along
Oh
On, two, one, two, three
Let's go, go, go, go
We sing this anthem for us all, all, all, all
Let's go, go, go, go
We sing this anthem for us all, all, all, all
We are the lost souls, we are the lost souls
We are the lost souls, we are the lost souls

Every night the same old game
After the show you are looking for something
You're on the road for much too long
Your love has grown between your legs
Don't need a love romance
All you want is something to ride
Princess you want to open your legs
It is time to show you my way of love
Reject emotions- satisfiy your feelings
Victim of lust- trapped in lunatic possession
Reject emotions- too horny to be alone
Reject emotions
Too shy maiden with innocent eyes
No chance for you to strike tonight
They don't realize your game of love
Love is a lie- a wasted business

Crucify Your Beliefs
I must seek shelter for my sins
Leave the world behind
I must go to extremities
The death extremities
Believe in my way because I'm pure
Your ultimate is your ultimate sin
Believe in a new way to separate
Your ultimate sacrifice is your ultimate sin
I must bring myself to hell
To know what heaven is
I must go to extremities
The death extremities
Believe in my way because I'm pure
Your ultimate is your ultimate sin
Believe in a new way to separate
Your ultimate sacrifice is your ultimate sin
Crucify your beliefs and make contribution
Crucify your beliefs for the sake of redemption
Crucify your beliefs for the great contradiction
Crucify your beliefs and save your own skin
A bullet and bible is all you need
In God We Trust... On Earth We Die
This is your fate; slave on the line
Crucify your belies for the great contradiction
Crucify your beliefs and save your own skin

Blood is spilled, bones are cracked, Fettered limbs are cruelly hacked,
Relentless brutal maniac, Violent death, gore attack... Torso... Choke on
guts, final breath, Now awaiting your morbid death, No more hope for life is
left, When I rip off your fucking head... Torso...

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.
The bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into fucking death.
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Into Perdition
Too Many Words Remain Yet Untold
So Here I Am
Achieving Godform And Instilling Decay
Forget The Past
don't Hide Your Feelings Away From Me Now
Bow- Be- Forever
Crawl For Redemption In Anguish Divine
Surrender The Earth
With The Dawn A New Strength Will Rise Now
Living Lies Of Denial
In Madness We Approach The Sun Again; Yes
A Final Deliverance
Leave The Fever Of Mankind Behind
In Lifeless Enigma
At One With The Sky we'll Burn Tonight
Skybound
Bow-Be-Forever
Skybound...
Panic
Anxiety
The Ultimate Affliction In Your Eyes
Centuries
Milleniums
Reduced To Ruins In Intimate Disguise
Skybound-Skybound-Skybound

What a Shame, breaking Down
What is getting the best of you
Take a breath'm it's not complex
I'm going to put your mind at ease
Innocent People are not meant to suffer
We're making negative energy power
This will be Our Truth
Can you feel us, we're stronger
We Pray on the Weak and conquer
No Longer care for those,
Who try to condemn and Oppose
We'll save Ourselves
You're afraid that I'm right,
I know it eats you up inside
Well listen to me and you will see
You have to let those fears fly free
The only danger in the world is to be
Weak minded with insecurities
This won't be our truth
Can you feel us, we're stronger
We Pray on the Weak and conquer
No Longer care for those,
Who try to condemn and Oppose
We'll save Ourselves
Why do you fear everyone of us
Why do you hate everyone of us, you crush us
Why do we feel we are wasting our time
Go away, end this now
You need to get down off this cloud
Start focusing and Listening
And feel it's the time to change things
When I'm alone, I don't feel hopeless at all
The day must come where we can stand tall
And this will be our truth
Can you feel us, we're stronger
We Pray on the Weak and conquer
No Longer care for those,
Who try to condemn and Oppose
We'll save Ourselves

I will have a feast on your soul
and watch your world as it comes tumbling down
you know there is no return
I will make you burn inside your time has come
I show no mercy
you know i know no other way
than to revel in your flesh
I am born to conquer
so you die
I live inside you
so you die
I won't surrender
so you die
and now when your days are counted
i have reached my goal
you are broken down
your life is lost i have collected yet another soul
that's when you see
that you have lost your soul to me
that's when you feel
that you have lost the will to live
and i am still here
waiting for the next to drain of life
and I am stronger now
than when i took your useless life
no living thing can be spared from my attack
when i feel the urge to kill
I hate your breath and the strength you get from life
because i have never lived
and now its my time to be one with
all the mortal ones that walk the earth
I enter human form my wicked soul lives on into eternity

Devouring my last rites
Without thoughts of changing
To have my life taken away
Inheriting the skills of
The dead to hunt and live
The dead to hunt and die
Because that is our only way
Never understanding
Tomorrow never comes
Waiting and believing
That they have got it wrong
Why are we made to suffer
For their ignorance, underestimated

Mother Earth gave the people
All they ever needed, wanted.
They got a paradise to live in
Eden thrived and prospered.
Life was simple, nature valued,
Earth was giving, the people willing.
Nothing was missing from human
generous was Mother Earth.
In the weak mind of Men jealousy, gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violated-the vicious, corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared!
Mother Earth she looked at Eden,
The exploited land, vicious Men.
Took no pity for the city,
Enforced a demise to the land!
She roused the seas to rush to shores,
Swallow all in Eden's doors.
The ingrate people and their city
Taking for granted everything!
In the weak mind of Men jealousy, gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violated-the vicious, corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared!

Pain-is deserved/
forgotten to/ Say- to acknowledge/
Away-for the last time/ And there
For there's one thing you've
That you've taken what's been given/
will be NO forgiveness/ Today-nor
around you within these walls
ever/ As the walls close in
Chorus: I spend/ All my life/
searching for something/ And it starts
to seem like it's a lie/ The more you run,
the less your chances/ Are you
scared to quit? Scared to die?
Because it's all my life (chorus)
NO/ Shame- you're feeling/
what/ Remains- forever/ Soon you start to lose your sense of/ Control- As its fading/
As the choices made reveal
Away0 like old time/
As you sense that it is slipping/
within these walls
Now it all comes back to haunt you/
Chorus (leave out last part (scared to die)
Now I'm afraid to be ALONE/
Scared to be ALONE/
You want and need to be ALONE/
Now as you strive to be ALONE/
But that goes away/
Within these walls I spend
Within these walls I spend/
Chorus x2

Rotting alive
Tearing my way through the meat
Driven to kill, my brain twitching for guts
Devoted to evil
Severed arteries gush
Hungry for the blood
Life is to decay
Victims meet my blade, carving out organs
A world of pain and terror
Visions of the future
Premonition of the evil, forthcoming eve of darkness
The chosen one will come
Eyes torn out bodies cut in half
Twisted corpses hang from broken necks
Demented madman
Unholy rampage
Impaled cranium beginning to drain
Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot
Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light
Live inside the shell
Feed upon infection
At one with the dead
I rip my way through
Easy prey, disfigured bodies decompose
Chewed limbs drip with pus, intestinal strangulation
Humans left ripped apart
Lap up the dripping goo
Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh
Internally you rot away
My need to kill
Induced by hate, betrayal of trusted ones
My mark left on this earth, victims of my slaughter
Souls of my dead, murdered by my
Hand
Blood on my face, innards decay
Snapping necks chewing flesh
Insatiable thirst
For blood
Slicing throats viciously uncontrollable insanity
Tear out the beating heart
Engulf the quivering spleen, chew the meat
Death is my life
Life is to decay victims
Meet my blade carving out organs, a world of pain
And terror, visions of the future
Premonition of the evil
Forthcoming, eve of darkness
Eyes torn out bodies cut in half
Twisted corpses hang
From broken necks, demented madman unholy rampage
Impaled cranium beginning to drain

Airborne cattle
dissected sections and quadrants
Complete abdominal extraction
Viscera intact and emptied
Drained of blood
Unsightly victim of government testing
possible extraterrestrial experimentation
Mute forever
Now buzzing with larvae and flies
biproduct of our bullshit existence
Cadavers for the spawning

Redeemer. I have seen your fate
Through fiction and relapse
The final curtains will fall
And there it rises up from the ground
Gazing upon the skies
Monolithic in temptation
I have seen war machines
Deathless in my dreams
The undercurrent
This great cold distance
I am deathless in my dreams
Crawling trough endless bloodstreams
Howling at the skies
Now disintegrating, senses wide awake
The serpent tower
No serenity has fallen
The serpent tower
Upon this land
Redeemer. I have seen your fate
Trough fiction and relapse
The final curtains will fall
And there it rises up from the ground
Gazing toward the skies
Monolithic in temptation
Flashing street lights
Why am I here?
I am deathless in my dreams
Crawling trough endless bloodstreams
Howling at the skies
Now disintegrating, senses wide awake
The serpent tower
No serenity has fallen
The serpent tower
Upon this lands

Time brings wisdom, time wrecks and destroys
Shadows come above the sky and takes one by one
Why did you forgot the things of it`s bringer
Although you rose on third day from the dead?
You promised us the new earth and sky
But you betrayed us over and over again, why?
You found us completely without a story
From the darkness our voices will be heard
Generations to the other, blood will be shed
World trambles slowly towards to it`s end
Voices of dark breaking the silence
And swallows the earth, the mindless
Who will not serve itself the master
Achieves nothing and will be forgotten
There is no use for the fear and pain
When you wake, you got thorns of power and strenght

Written & composed by Phil Wilde, Andy Janssens, Wanda Walker Janssens & Kate Ryan
You see in my eyes a reflection
That I wanna give you affection
My eyes don't lie
They show you my deepest emotion
When we make love in slow motion
My eyes don't lie
All the things you see are previews of you and me
My eyes don't lie a thing
My eyes don't lie a thing
All the things I see are secrets you share with me
My eyes don't hide a thing
My eyes don't hide a thing
Chorus
It's hard to reveal
There's something about you
We're two halves of a whole
You're my heart - You're my soul
x2
No need to search for devotion
My body will give you the notion
My eyes don't lie
Swept by the deepest temptation
I'll show you my imagination
My eyes don't lie
All the things you see are previews of you and me
My eyes don't lie a thing
My eyes don't lie a thing
All the things you see are secrets you share with me
My eyes don't hide a thing
Your eyes don't hide a thing
Chorus x2

the blood that stains your hands will never be washed clean.
shooting victims with the weapon of our design you knew all along teaching us
to give in.
so bleed us dry.
i will not be a martyr for your crusades.
this war will never be for you.

Likes rats we strip the earth
Rampant animals and beast
Children in a stupor
Frustation is unleashed
Cauterize emotion
Striking at our worst fear
Breeding with unopen minds
And drowning in our tears
Grasping bloodied hands
Reaching out in agnoy
Life torn apart at the seams
Gripping throes of death
Crippling with zest
We are impaling our own being
Scorn Scorn
Corruptive minds at work
Open our eyes to see
Complusive wat to act
Implusive way to be
Eating at the remains
To crumble in decay
Turning onto ourselves and
The life that we reject
Scorn Scorn

Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead
to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!

Roasted visions unherald the call
Pay the piper or face the fall
Unpleasant benevolence
Undesired, it's your defence
Rotting flavoured retribution
Burning hotly in your throat
Perished antiseptic inner domains
Drowning love begins to float
The familiar screams aloud
Mainline my blackened bones
Exaction with a vengeance
History consumes its own
Wicked voice, a whispering flame
Stems from all past foul deeds
Telling me that you're to blame
Ruled by your bitter creeds
An ordered mind, my constitution
Left me on my own
Aggravating your solution
Running blood from stone
Bastard wanton act betrayed me
Left me all alone
Yet I'll survive
Honesty a poor mutation
An uprising complication
Doubtful you will ever change
Senility onset of age
I'm betrayed
Red blood out, the black runs in
Spreading wings and claws
Flooding me in a sickly grin
With sharply smiling jaws
Hate...
Save me all that humane thought
Judge not the moment past
Frozen heart, to the last bone
Pumping on this blood from stone
Wicked voice, a whispering flame
Stems from all past foul deeds
Telling me that you're to blame
Ruled by your bitter creeds
An ordered mind, my constitution
Left me on my own
Aggravating your solution
Running blood from stone

Soon I will be falling down
The way I always
And I remember falling
And I remember crawling
Still I'm falling
Have you come down
From all the peeling?
'Cause I remember holy
And only God can save me
Still I'm falling
This is the last time I'll speak of holding you
Take this from me and take it before it dies
'Cause this is the last time I'll speak of, holding you
Still I'm falling
This is the last time I'll speak of holding you
And you get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall away

Examples of barbarism miss what you mock
Slight pause to vomit
Advocating organ harvesting, equal opportunity destroyer
Spontaneous combustion

Nights came tralling ghost concertos
Heartstrings a score of skeletal reaper bows
Playing torture chamber music allegretto
Conducting over throes trashed to crescendo
Skinless the dark shall scream
Hoarse Her symphonies
Deathmashed as the moon
That had lifted Her dreams
And frowned on the winding steps down
To where the vulgar strayed,
Taunting sick Her tender prey
She glided in Her bridal gown
How sleep the pure
Desire in Violent Overture
An emanation of phantom madness
The Countess beheld in shroud
By girls bereft of future vows
Soon to wed in white the frosted ground
Burning like a brand on the countenance of god
A yearning took Her hand to His Seraphim, bound
Deep red hissed the cat whips
On the whim of ill-will
Whilst She entranced, nonchalant, abliss
Flayed further songs of overkill
How weep the pure
Desire in Violent overture
In a crescent-whime cellar of crushed roses
Pooled blood and broken dolls
A torchlit shadow theatre souled
With the echoed cries of lives She stole
Killing time
She struck the hours dead
In Her control
Thus menopaused
Her clock of hacked out cunts
Began to toll
"Thirteen chimes of ancient strain
I conjure forth with dirge
That fills the void with timbred pain
To fulfil my sexual urge"
Frights came wailing from the Darkside
Haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes
Velvet, their voices coffined Her in slumber
Bespattered and appeased
As pregnant skies outside bore thunder
How sleep the pure
Desire in violent overture
As when high winds
Attune whipped trees
Her savage nature pitched
Would once again conduct the pleas
Of those She loved to agonies
As if it were
The first time every night
That She carved Her seal
In the flesh of life.

A tool to do good has gone bad
Electric altar for a new religion
A new way to link
A new way to think
Individual thoughts that have become missing
Laugh at my words you fool
They will soon become living truth
Look at yourself in the mirror
Reflection is living proof
What will they do when the link they live becomes missing?
Will they survive?
When the link they breathe becomes missing

Its time you see the world for what it truly is. A dead whore who's last words were fuck me again. Its time you see me for who I really am. I'm the walking wounded bleeding clever lies from within.
These hands have held the bloody corpse of my dead lover.
And with your skin stretched tight Ill beat you till your blind. Ill do it to you before you can do it to me because we share the same sickness inside. And with our hands clasped tight you'll beg me not to try but Ill do it to you before you can do it too me because we share the same sickness inside.
I want to forget your face
I want to forget the way you fucking taste.(2x)
Names mean nothing now, my eyes only see the blackest of the black. Waiting for the kiss from gods fallen children and there's no turning back. There's no turning back.

Your not so perfect, just fucking plastic. Just fucking plastic.

i have memories
clouded by sorrow
of a time in life
when blood ran though my veins
but these walls keep closing
suffocating
and now i'm trapped beneath
the weight of my own loss
in the company
of my misery
i gasp for air
only to drown
again
unending waves of memories
life's only gife bestowed to me

You're the source.
My disbelief in innocence arise.
Feel that ghost seducing me.
Try to reach a hand in that golden circle.
You are no angel. And my heart is more than emptyness.
In the shadow of myself and I sleep under the trees
and no one else is sleeping well.
Burn me tonight. Feeling my lies slip away.
Burn me tonight.
And kill the demons in me.
Facing a saint feeling my life slip away.
Burn me tonight.
Until I'm disapointed.
Burn me tonight and kill the demons in me.
I disbelief in the summer in pearl lake.
I'm the pine float.
And now you're falling apart from me.
You are no angel!!!

Here they are! I feel them!
They're coming here to destroy us!
They're the murder angels.
Earth has finished every her resource
Water's at an end, poison in the air
and now come the murder angels.
The people on Earth will be decimated
for useless atomic wars
Animals and vegetation are long since dead
cosmic radiations are stifling us.
Welcome, murder angels!
Welcome, cursed heartless angels
you who come from far away
to be destroyers.
Man is exhausting is normal being
it is the right price for evolution
by the time it's all over.
Matter has reached the ultimate stage
now everything has been created and built
Mental energy choked every substance
now we are all too close to God.
Welcome, murder angels!
Welcome, cursed heartless angels
you who come from far away
to be destroyers.
Ambition has open wide its doors
Greed advances into the human heart
machines have become a religion.
Feelings have changed to radiations
love becomes plastic ice
Human bodies smell of putrefaction
cosmic radiations are stifling us.
Welcome, murder angels!
Welcome, cursed heartless angels
you who come from far away
to be destroyers.

Five on the run
Running dry
Their hands on mouth, ears or eyes
Five and again
Looking back
Again on the run
And up the wall
Repetition
Competition
I ain't scared
Are you
Let's be the dogs that bite the hands that fed us for so long
Fear, I won't let you in
Right in the line of fire, I turn around and look at
Fear, I won't let you win
I make you shrink, until you disappear
I can't hear you breathing
I don't see you cry
If you are what they call alive
Then what the hell am I
Five on the hunt
Hunting the brave
Feel the bars from which side of the cage
Five are hurt
Hurting for immunity
Of change
Communication
Regulation
I ain't scared
Are you
Frightened people are great believers in security
Fear, I won't let you in
Right in the line of fire, I turn around and look at
Fear, I won't let you win
I make you shrink, until you disappear
Killing
No more
Killing under the constraints of caution
Again
Again
Again

In the bowels of rocky mountain
A fiery bird I forged
Forged from iron, from molten steel
A flaming eagle, majestic beast
On the wings of my eagle
To black river I flew
To the dale of the dead
To the stream that grinds all flesh
The eagle soared sky high
Touched the vault of heaven
The sky sparkled, cracked and creaked
The eagle soared sky high
Soared my flaming griffin
The thunder crashed and rolled
Rolled the monster's head
I found a monster, a black giant pike
From its jaws my eagle saved me
Dragged the fish under the sun
Split its belly, ripped the head off
I rolled the pike's head to the house of the north
I threw the bony skull at the haughty queen
Here's a throne for you to rest your frozen bones
I have done my share, now keep your promise
I had made the heavens, forged out a miracle
The snake infested field of death turned over
Slayed the wolf of shadow lands
Shackled the bear of death
I captured the impossible
The pike from the black river

Frost came and took your heart of darkness
You're lost, fear creeps in and let it start
Night cracks the spine of dying day
Fight but you can't make it go away
Fill your soul with ravenous fire
Kill the light and reborn for the light
End up times among the pathetic lies
Rise above the majestic life
Open mind for a newfound world
to be the part of our herd
Follow us, the heart of darkness
Follow us, no more mortal
Come with us, the heart of darkness
Follow us and you're free

He is hater of the rotten Earth
He is the nova that will drape the sky in woe
We drink from his poisoned water
He is lord of those who dwell bound in sickness
Spitting vomit in the face of faith
Cleansing us who must atone for being weak
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the shadow cast upon those defiled
Victorious call
It will not befall
No salvation is free
Death comes beckoning thee
Encircle thee
Voices come in wind
Son of perdition
You come beckoning me
The sky embedded in the death of a nova
Effigy is seen in a second of light
No voice in the crack of his mouth
Bastard son of God

This light that I see deep inside
Songs from Valhalla they come
Spiritual weaponry
I'm tired, the end is close
One more night and my live is done
Spiritual weaponry
The sun creeps under the shadows in gray
Coldness is my torment
This is the beginning of an eternal trip
This is the way to my last battle
My life fly's away
For death embraces my last wish
The desire to get more
I'm weak but I'm a warrior
I'm gonna fight for my honor and land
The last blood in my veins
Flows for you Wotan
I swear yes, I swear yes
I swear for you Wotan

I bow down your precious icon, deity of self suppression
This effigy of flesh, corporeal Christi, nailed
In submission to this false idol, seeking deliverance
From this spiritual hierarchy, downward spiralling, a corrupt throne
Of repression and guilt
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn
On my knees, before this tormented flesh, in irreverence
In communion with this parasitic host of virtuous divinity
This imperious creed bears testament to the failures of our morality
Righteous durance is our cross we bear in stations
In stations of the lost
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn, thy kingdom burn
Our will be done
From your knees arise
By your own hand, your god you scribe
The earth shall inherit the meek
Your god is dead
Bound down, in God we're trussed, foul stature
Icons embodied in flesh, we nail
In servitude to deities fashioned in our self image
Shadows of eternal strife cast by those who serve
Serve a crown of pawns

The parade of the quaternary symbiosis
Token of a divided existence
Univocal sense of the hallow consistence
A silver stream of cryonics stars
The corrosion of the reality narcosis
Negligence makes the future tense
Axis bent into never ending continuance
Exploring new ground, inverse and far
Coequal nexus of neural perception
Pre-eminant sample of hastins ions
Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the fallen creation
The bow of the axis, inversely
Inherit the Earth
Conqual nexus of neural perception
Circular reminisce of history lair
Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the rising creation
To bend the axis, eternally
Inherit the Earth
Past, present and future
Angels of thrice, fusion twice
Past, present and future
Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the fallen creation
The bow of the axis, inversely
Inherit the Earth
By the instinct of the rising creation
To bend the axis, eternally
Inherit the Earth

Degeneration tears your blackened eyes
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives, the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies
World of lies
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me
Demonic vultures feed on your mind
Disarmed of all your pride you die
No life in our alien eyes, the blind lead the blind
The sun sets forever on the non-divine
World of lies
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me
Final psychotic eclipse
Painted in the colors of war
Final psychotic eclipse
A world drenched in blood
Degeneration tears your blackened eyes
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives, the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies
World of lies
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me
And it's his illusions about what
Constitutes the real world which are inhibiting him
His reality, his reason, his society
These are what must be destroyed
Luke Rinehart, 'The Dice Man'
Final psychotic eclipse
Painted in the colors of war
Final psychotic eclipse
A world drenched in blood

Ass in the air, turd ring dialating
Matted butt hair, anal vapor rising
Give it a squeeze, my feast is emerging
Give it to me, let's begin the purging
I open my mouth and catch it as it drops
I chew and chew and love it brown and soft
I squish the crap between my teeth with my tongue
With a shit eating grin I'll lick 'til clean your bung
I'm a shit eater
Steaming chunky hunk of log
Taste it smell it eat it all
Maybe one turd maybe two
Whatever I can get from you

[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]
Hear me now; let this be the day of reckoning.
The gauntlet has been thrown, and the challenge is met.
With death-rattle chains, and brimstone from below.
I will come with black-hearted rage, and eyes of burning coal.
Let the fire burn and blood flow, let skulls and bones tower up to the heavens.
Cloaked in shimmering stellar glow, radiant with the cosmic light I will come...
From the liquid darkness I appear,
My unholy fire is needed to cleanse this world.
Free from my cursed bounds,
I once again will trample the earth.
Bound to evil, carrier of Satan's mark.
Wherever I will walk, the world will tremble.
Thus I have spoken, thus shall it be....
Chaos swallows the earth when I release my Christian hatred,
A hatred older than memory.
I move across the worlds like a dark plague,
Across boundaries unseen.
I ask for the gates to open,
And for my legions to be set free....
I call upon the power of darkness, form and shadow.
I call upon the power of the elder ones, whose fate is bound to mine.
I call upon master Satan, give shadow form and lend me your eyes.
Grant me your crystal vision, and teach me what you would have seen.
The chain of Christian force is broken,
And the great darkness is loosened upon this world.
Thus I have spoken, thus shall it be...

Hell-bent on standardization; on Cartesian deliverance. Time is the primary socializing tool. Indelibly imprinted and structurally biased. We are domesticated creatures of technical abstraction. If rationalism/reductionism is our religion, then time keeping is our benediction. Reified and ratified in fixed ideas and solid state circuitry. This baptism took place on the hinges of history by the faithful who made repression a cardinal requisite. By the faithful who made the timepiece as holy as the cross. Hell-bent on standardization: the wheel keeps turning and we all turn with it.

This enigma keeps me entangled
On the edge of insanity
Living my
Transient being in
Trance
Wisdom has withered me
Within this warren of confusion
I feel a
Zephyr,
Showing me the way
Stealing the pleasure to see me fall
All atrocities,
Carved in it's
Walls
Fed my hate for a long time
I know they did not expect
It felt
So good having
Control
Their faces made worth all these years
A truculent path paved
With disillusions
Made me conscienceless
I trapped through all stages of life
Trapped
Inside, myself
Trapped inside myself
From a distance observing
How my passion is their
Pain
Now I'm
Pulling the strings
And I won't stop the bleeding
From a distance
Observing
How my
Passion is your pain
Now I'm pulling the strings
And I won't stop the
Bleeding...
This
Enigma keeps me entangled
On the edge of insanity
Living my transient
Being in trance
Wisdom has withered me
Fed my hate for a long time
I know they did not
Expect
It felt
So good having control
Their faces made worth all these years
A
Truculent path paved
With disillusions
Made me conscienceless
I trapped through all stages of
Life
Trapped
Inside myself
From a distance observing
How my passion is their pain

With my blood there will be no compromise.
born into this world with everything.
you had too much to give.
with your bullshit attitude you lost it all.
another friday night another place to kill yourself.
another friday night another fucking place to die.
with my blood pressure from the daily grind.
yeah it fucking scks at least i have my family until the day i die.
i owe it to myself and to my friends to be strong.
until the day i die.
if there is one thing i will never forget.
its those fucking days.
when you walked alone, all alone.
we shared a bond thats never broken. and that bond.
that fucking bond will die with me.
Your fucking empty and you will die alone.

Arrived we to the days ov our beginning
To the City ov God clothed with the mists
Enslaved by life we danced spinning
In the taverns of time we used to sit
And drunk with memories
Dead moments glorified
I saw the phantoms ov Golgotha
Legion Legion
Fed on dust ov dead
Anoited by the grey ash
Mad, twisted mob ov Jerusalem
Then Raphael beyond me and night appear'd
Bent and The Word was announc'd
An archangelic grreting (Jetzirah! Jetzirah!)
The sign ov Portal, reality ov nature
Not to be, but to become
In aimless wandering across the time
On the sea ov possibilities untouched I stood
From my hand cracked heaven idols are falling to the pieces
Reached the horizon
Dagger in the air
Sylphs work is done
Oracles ov past aeons fulfill'd
Live we on the edge ov the worlds
In titanic turn ov time
Here and beyond
Carried on the wings ov the sun
Infinite, sacred power we call
And sight hardly can catch the moment ov eternity
When drink with light
In light we will live
And in the formless rapture
Will we sing psalm ov Might
The last spell ov Will:
"We are one
We are none!"

The pack of wolves
Are closing in
Now, hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through the winter woods
And soon it's time to feast
A vicious hunt
On through the night
The prey is short of breath
They feel the sting
Of burning eyes
That's fixed upon their necks
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A natural force
They show their sharp
And grinning teeth
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills
Down fleeing spines
Their blood runs hot as fire
The vicious chase
Is soon at end
They're hunted until death
They feel the pain
Of sharpened steel
That's cutting through their flesh
Fearless warriors
Feed the wolves
Now hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
See the Gray-Backs feast
A natural force
It knows no remorse
And lives for the kill

cry, wake the sleeping lie
pray I'm always there for you
beware of you
die, agony inside
pray the rain will fall on you
it's all for you
will I punish your heaven?
will I be there to go with you?
will I bury the raven?
and will I stand to watch you burn?
say will we dive in the water?
say will I die in your water?
say will I cry for this moment to live?
say will I cry for the water?
cry, swear to walk in line
pay the ones who steal your heart
in dreams apart
die, melodies all mine
prey the dawn will be your guard
so free to start
will I punish your heaven?
will I be there to go with you?
will I bury the raven?
and will I stand to watch you burn?
say will we dive in the water?
say will I die in your water?
say will I cry for this moment to live?
say will I cry for the water?

As the cold penetrated in my body
And I heard the child's crying,
Then the strange woman I saw
And in her arms my soul infatuated the sorrow.
Ah no, I departed, departed and lost my love.
In a dream I saw her my dead body to embrace.
I mourned for her, yes, mourned and hoped
That in my new being I would find her perhaps.

I feel a chill in my heart
Like lingering winter cold
I and my son are torn apart
He was just 6 winters old
My first-born was he
And the last of my kin
The last one to carry my name
Death smiled at him its deadly grin
There is no one for me to blame
The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hell's gate
I carry him to my ship
He seems to be asleep
But the deep blue color of his lips
Is enough to make me weep
No man should have to bury his child
Yet this has been my share
The tears I shed run bitter and wild
It's a heavy burden to bear
His body feels so light in my arms
His skin is pale as snow
Yet his weight feels heavy in my heart
As my sadness continues to grow
Allfather!
What fate has been given me?
Why must I suffer?
Why must I feel this pain?
All father!
Life has lost it's meaning to me
I think I'm going insane!
I lay him down on a pyre
A burial worthy a king
And as I lie down by his side
I hear the weaving norns sing
The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hell's gate
The fate of Norns await us all
I know this to be true
It's time to answer Odens's call
My son, he calls for me and you

I wont hide behind my fuckign words or my failures.
I dont want you to fucking pray for me
because I've been here a thousand times before.
I never know what the fuck is in store.
and I dont want you to fucking pray for me.
I wont hide behind my fucking words.
Some believe that everything in life comes for free.
I will work until I bleed because anything doesnt come for free.
I've been here a thousand times.
I never know what the fuck is in store.
I dont want you to fucking pray for me.
and your days your fucking days wont come.
when everythings the same.
you say that things will change.
things wont change i will never hide behind my words.
things wont change and i will never turn my back on my friends.
Things wont change.

The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formula of evolution and sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
As we slowly awaken from slumber
The malpractice of the spirit ends
Gateways!
When the gift is once again attained
Gateways!
No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways!
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways!
No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways!
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways!
It's all there for the eye that can see
The blind ones will always suffer in secrecy
For it is the omen
Of what lies submerged
Untouched within us
The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formulae of evolution and sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
To receive the light that shines in darkness
The light that shines forevermore
Forevermore!

Of your own masterplan
Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlatch and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own masterplan!

Inhale glory, exhale fear...no God or master to make me kneel
Inhale courage, explode force...I am Lord I break your laws
I raise my fist in blasphemy, with the sign of the horns...In praise of the rebel angel.
Who stood proud, stood strong, alone, against God
Cast out, thrown down. Hated, feared and left to die!
I am the rebel angel, living like the devil
Rebel angel, to the death!
Call of the devil, follow the devil, fall like an angel, rise like the devil.
I take pleasure, the forbidden fruits...you fear my freedom and call me evil
Inhale darkness, feel the strength: every wound just makes me harder
I am demon, burning feathers...the wings of my soul turn into leather
Inhale vengeance, feed the flames: howling in hatred, screaming in Hell
You cannot control me; I'm so much stronger.
I'm your enemy, I'm your Satan...and this fire burns deeper than you'll ever know!
I am the rebel angel, living like the devil

Flying through these nightmares, burning worlds of hell, yeah
Horror angel, till I die!
And on this path of pain, I stand all alone...
Rebel angel, to the end and to the death!

We flow with bitter words that file sharp our teeth
And we bite off our own tongues
We trample any trace of your divinity's hope
And we'll sacrifice our young
With our eyes sewn shut now the light can't shine
Oh, we'll never wake from dead
And when you beg for us to open up and let you in
Then we'll cut you out instead
You promised you'd give us your word
We never believed it was true
And we pretend that we never heard
Cus we still don't believe in you
I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for?
We die for life
We built a wall to keep you out
Ignoring every word
And we saw your face behind our thoughts
Apathetic to what we'd heard
You promised you'd give us your word
We never believed it was true
And we pretend that we never heard
Cus we still don't believe in you
I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for?
We die for life
Why does it falter? We built it all ourselves
Why does it hurt so bad, forsaking all this help?
Why are we choking on pills designed to heal?
We threw our hearts away cus we're too afraid to feel
I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for?
We die for life

You took the step and slipped away
Enchanted by a friendly face
You thought it was love
It took your life out of your hands
You never dreamt that it would ever and never end
Bought and sold
Should have seen it from the start
He stole your love and broke your heart
Love out on display
Among your shattered dreams you stand
Make a reason out of hollow words
What's it worth
[Chorus]
Oh oh oh YouOll never be the same
Put your trust on love
You're not alone
Oh oh oh I'll lighten up your darkest night
Close your eyes
I will be your day
Seasons come and seasons go
A miracle about to show
Love will come around
Put yourself back in the light
Lose the shadows of your darkest night
You'll be fine
[Chorus]

Awake, awake for the dream has failed
And failure speaks the purest truth.
Time was lost before our eyes,
Now on your knees to worship depravity.
My oath to madness whispered seven times,
Can hold the answer within all these lies.
My oath to madness, within seven breaths,
Can hold the answer and the weight of lies.
This is my oath to the lie.
Scream, scream for vindication,
For madness comes in many waves.
Blindness was left behind
And consciousness vanishes beneath the waves.
My oath to madness whispered seven times,
Can hold the answer within all these lies.
My oath to madness, within seven breaths,
Can hold the answer and the weight of lies.
This is my oath to the lie!
This is my oath to the madness!
My oath to madness whispered seven times,
Can hold the answer within all these lies.
My oath to madness, within seven breaths,
Can hold the answer and the weight of lies.
This is my oath to the lie!
This is my oath to the madness!
This is my oath to the lie!
This is my oath to the madness!

A predator Awaits
His time to be discovered
Just waiting for a prey
The index case
He will spread the death
Through all the race
The horseman of the plague
Now it' s useless
to pray . . .
Andromeda strain you will die soon
Loosing blood through every hole
Melena, myalgia and fever
Ebola-like disease
Now you have the touch of death
Deterioration by sweating blood
Repulsive body in
Agony . . .
The prophecy was true
Eradication of our kind
Alone we walk the path
Many of us will die
Only the chosen may survive this time . . .
Of chaos and death
Your face becomes a mask
Of expressionless white skin
From where the sunken eyeballs
Cry bloody tears that fall
Screams from all around
Everywhere the bloody eyes
That stare with the horror
Only death can paint
in the eyes . . .
[Chorus]
The prophecy was true...
[Solo Tono]
Struggling to breath
Walking through streets
Where convulsing bodies
Just fall and die
Before your eyes
The vision of the slaughter
Of a heartless killer
You see a pregnant women
With a fetal loss
And genital bleeding
There's nothing you can do
But pray for her
She died in a state of shock
And the pain of her lost
[Solo Ndua]
Your time has come
nausea , vomiting, bleeding, myalgia, fever
anuria, melena, delirium, tachypnea, convulsions
coma, stertor, death
[Chorus]
Has ended with our kind ?
There's no disease
That can kill us all
A few just may survive
There's hope, an other chance
[Lead Ndua]
But for now the silence reigns
Many corpses in the slaughter field
With their static bloody eyes
Just wondering why?
The smell of rotting flesh
Floats with the wind
That also caries the disease

I want to do everything yet I sit and do nothing. All that say, says nothing at all. Does mere existence truly justify itself? Optional in your world of confusion, powerless in my world of frustration. You seem to laugh, I sit and cry. In this world we all lose to the politics of lies.

Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light
That came in through the pretty window picture.
I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was "I believe in You."
Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was "I believe in You."
I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

Unholy pedophile
Preying on the innocent
Protected by the papacy
So called men of enlightenment
Children fingered by the hand of God
Raped in the name of Christ
They took a vow of chastity
Yet have torn asunder so many a life
Chicken hawks of the Catholic Church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy
Men so benevolent
In a position of trust
Molesting children by the score
Rendering young life straight into the dust
They're church is their Golgotha
Their crucified by the priest
Child becomes the victim
Holy Father becomes the beast
Chicken hawks of the Catholic Church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy
Multi-million dollar payouts
Restitution for their crimes
This vile sickness
Cut so many down in their prime
All the bishops and the cardinals
Tried to hide it away
In the parish and cathedrals
The predators come to prey
Chicken hawks of the Catholic Church
Out to save and destroy
They have become the priest of burden
And he's become an altered boy

Mere emeles
Mere selem
I em'a den
Lashtal
Lucifer!
Lucifer!
Aivass!
So every man and woman is a star
But who is Scorpio by fire ring'd
Where fall means increase?
When on the throne of life he seats
The bloody sword of freedom sways
And light of hells in his eyes
And secret breath of love
As the first whore of the world
Banish'd god from body
Carnal divinity she restor'd
As infinite of nightsky
Augmn ov sothis
When tunnel of tuat means disorder
Past, future, painful
And from the eternal revolt we're born
To word can make flesh

When horny flames begins to rise
To burn your flesh and bone
That's when you realize you've never
Been so scared and alone
You start to cry you're gonna die
So pray for all your sins
The flames begins to reach too high
The fire burns and wins
Die in fire die in fire
Die in fire die in fire
You can't take the heat much longer
You can't stand the burning pain
The night is far too dark for angels
So light up the night with flames
Nothing really turns me on
Like seeing you burn to dust
But you are not alone to feel the heat
My body burns with lust
Die in fire die in fire
Die in fire die in fire
Now when your body burned to dust
Is spread by the midnight breeze
I gotta find another girl
To satisfy my needs
I'll tie her up and then once more
The all caressing flames
Shall rise again to light the night
And she will scream of pain
Die in fire die in fire
Die in fire die in fire

In my dream smoke followed me
As on fire the whole world had been
To the yard I walked in
Up the frontstep and opened the door
Cranes flew over to the North
As I walked on dry
And passed through a grove
Yellow with flowers
They had been expecting me
They said so and I believed
I'm my dream smoke came to me
And we became as one
I am smoke

Shrouded in a cold dark mist, my mind is urging me to kill, forced, by an
Unseen hand. I cross the boundary between good and evil time and time again.
As I watch you die. While the blood runs down to earth. Your screaming warms
My body. Like the sun on a cold winters day. I'm the captor of your soul.
Stole you from this earth. Never to be seen again. Unaware in that night.
Under the golden wings of death.
Shrouded in a cold dark mist, my mind is urging me to kill, forced, by an
Unseen hand. I cross the boundary between good and evil time and time again.
Under the golden wings of death. Shrouded in a cold dark mist, my mind is
Urging me to kill, forced, by an unseen hand. I cross the boundary between
Good and evil time and time again. I'm the captor of your soul. I stole your
Body from the earth. Unaware in that night. Of the horror that was coming your
Way.
Under the golden wings of death

I always thought my war was eternal
and steel my only friend
I spent all my life fighting alone
on my own
Until I found Tanelorn
And a new man was born
[CHORUS]
We shall be free
Reaching immortality
We shall walk free through the trees of the forest of light
We shall walk free through the trees of the forest of light
No more pain
No death in vain
Sanctuary of peace
Where in harmony we can live
Where I know we will meet again
Soft sunlight shines for the heroes
Now weary of war
The ghosts of a past of endless fighting
means nothing any more
Now I live in Tanelorn
And a new life is born
[CHORUS]

Walk alone. I stare at the footprints of my life. and I think I lost you,
When I began to run away.
So far, so far away from home.
Your approval, was the
Only crown I seeked.
I no longer doubt myself.
Too long, I've walked in shadows
Of my worst enemies.
So was it worth the game to lose our purities?
Won't wear the crown of thorns.
Won't wear the mask of judas.
I'll never be who you
Want me to be.
You'll never see the beauty I see.
Mark me for death.
Mask me for torture.
Mark me for death.
I stare at the footprints.
And you, so far away.
I no longer doubt myself.
Too long, I've walked in shadows of my worst enemies.
So was it worth the game to lose our purities?
Won't wear the crown of thorns.
Won't wear the mask of judas.
I'll never be who you want me to be.
You'll never see the beauty I see.
Mark me for death.
Mask me for torture.
Mark me for death.
Mask me for torture.
I hope you see my face on your fucking death bed.
I hope you see my face on your death bed.
You played the role of the angel,
Now you'll see my face in hell.
You fooled my mind with your selfish ambition.
Bitch.
You played the role of the angel, now you'll see my face in hell.
You played the role, you played the role of the saint,
Now you'll see my face, my face in hell.
Walk alone.
I stare at the footprints of my life.
And I think I lost you, when I began to run away.
So far, so far away from home.
Your approval, was the only crown I seeked.
I no longer doubt myself.
Too long, I've walked in shadows of my worst enemies.
So was it worth the game to lose our purities?
Won't wear the crown of thorns.
Won't wear the mask of judas.
I'll never be who you want me to be.
You'll never see the beauty I see

The rotting corpse lies on a mortuary slab
Pus starts to burst from each visceral scab
Body temperature drops, bone seizure takes place
As the discharge oozes from the boils on the face
Suppurated - Pyosisified
Pustulated - Soggy insides
The cataleptic remains incite the suppuration
Giving way to the stench of anal emanation
This repulsive concoction drips onto the floorCleansing the viscous enzymes of the body's inner core

Witness the blueprints of hate
Weeding out the hope forlorn
Following a stronger will in vain
Self indulgence
Agony forever more
Forsaken spite, the final thrill
Another blessing in disguise
Bastard nation
I fucking have the need to hate
Into despite, out of control
In-decision
Mercenary venture blast
In to despite control
Hypocrisy in-tolerance
All ways go down
Go down
Come here to face me
Displaying the anger
The blueprints of hate
These are blueprints of hate
I'm sworn to resist in a world full of lie
These are blueprints of hate
I'm sworn to resist in a world full of lie
World of lie
So full of agony inside
Releasing these blueprints of hate
Full Of Lie

slither inside
can't go where I hide
so delicate and weak
you dare not collide
the truth in me
too dark to see
so bitter the taste
now the poison runs free
on the dream that you once rode
now your visions all corrode
you're the one that sent me
would I betray?
when all hope is gone and the damage done
I'm still alive
the addiction's strong
you can't erase me
won't go away
of hatred and scorn
of the heart that's been torn
from a darkened womb
in your dreams I was born
the first and the last
out of the past
one final solution
now its coming down fast

The feeble leafs decline,
Enshrined in downing deep
The mourn abandoned plains,
Laid down in sombre sleep
Misty shades engulf the sky
Like past, worn memories
The bird's song fills the whispering breeze
With autumns melody
The lunar pale grim shape
At evening's sight renews
It's silented wail relieves
Repressed thoughts anew
I hear the lonesome choir
Of fortunes past my way
Disdained in fiery weeps
Throughout my every day
These skies I hail and treasure thee,
Most pleasant misery
Not pittes thorn I shelter thine
Mysterious harmony
Draw on most pleasant night
Shade my lorn exposed sight
For my grief's when shadows told
Shall be eased in mist enfold
Why should the foolish's hope
Thy unborn passioned cry
Exhaust unheard
Beneath this pleasent sky?
For if the dusking day declined
Could delight be far behind?

down below the voice of treachery
above the vile acts of cruelty
beyond the rims of our destiny fallen
a cruce salus
and still there are things I need to day
and always things I see myself do
yet in the end there's one truth only
freedom in its ultimate form
remove the fetters from your feet
and rise again to breathe the air anew
when body's broken
and when your clothes are torn
faith when the courage is crawling
and you're left there all alone
replace your heart with peace
and love your enemy
for today we walk together on
towards eternity

Ripping from me is this haunting admission, so daunting
A complete jealousy of the recently dead
The deepest of all admirations, so foul
Of who'd choose to aim bullets for the hinds of their heads
Have you ever tasted it?
Metallic barrel placed in it?
Do you possess the gall to pain all those in life you've touched?
Failure, I renounce our tenure
This venture has drained me
I ask thee grant self murder's bliss
My conscience has begged me to end this horrendousness
Wrap rope so tightly 'round my neck and twist
Suicide be my guide
The only thing I will get right in this life
My appeal shall not be denied
My place - now secured
My home - the other side
I never belonged here
I never did ask if I could join this world collapsed
A hell hath awakened and now I choose sleep
So let this razor get the better of me
Suicide be my light
The only wrong I stand to right in this life
To the ear of the Reaper confide
His blade offers mercy
May it tear me wide
I never belonged here
I never did ask if I could join this world collapsed
My hell hath awakened and now I choose sleep
So let this gesture do the talking for me
Dear Mother and Father, now look what you've made
More eager fodder for the depth of a grave
For the sweet gift of life you've both bestowed upon me
You'll wish that you'd felt inclined to keep the fucking receipt

Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I'm gone
Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to Asagods
As long as the raven flies

You're a worker bee
Can't you see?
A cog in the wheel
Of their factory
You'll do what you're told
Until you grow old
Or you get laid off
Because the company's sold
Change your mind
To change the way
You've lived up tilll now
Go somewhere
And have some fun
While you remember how
They'll buy a machine
Know what I mean?
It punches your holes
At twice the speed
And half the cost
Look at the boss
A smile on his face
He's laughing his ass off
Change your mind
To change the way
You've lived up tilll now
Go somewhere
And have some fun
If you remember how

Welcome to my panic
And I'm sure you know the fool
Where everything comes crashing down
And madness is the rule
Your mind is set to overload
With doomsday information
I see you've come here just in time
To join the celebration
[CHORUS]_________________________________________
Don't fight it, invite it
Voices in my head
Just try it, entice it
Telling me I'm dead
Don't fight it, invite it
Playing with my brain
Just try it, entice it
Driving me insane
_________________________________________________
Starting with that warm rush,
Slicing down the spine
They tell me that it's not for real,
It happens all the time
But something different's happening
And I think this is the one
I gotta get me outta here,
I gotta turn and run
[REPEAT CHORUS]
Facing the shock and the terror alone,
A time bomb just waiting to blow
You cannot escape and there's nowhere to hide,
You're fleeing with no place to go
Feeling like nothing can save me,
A feeling I know all too well
Imprisonned by paranoid madness,
comdemned to a live spent in hell
Everything is spinning round,
This torture of the soul
My heart is racing, can't stop shaking,
I got to get control
Terrified, don't wanna die,
Hysteria sets in
But when you learn just to invite it,
Panic never wins
[REPEAT CHORUS]

You love the rush, the rush of the win
Risk of defeat, risk everything
Feel you can cheat death one more time
There's nothing else till you cross the line
Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line, cause you've got to see
[Chorus:]
Ten, ten seconds
Ten seconds at at time you feel alive for
Ten, ten seconds
Living your life in a quarter mile
Time to focus, you picture the win
The engine roars, feel the rush within
You must pursue this victory
There is nothing else you have to be
Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line, cause you've got to see
[Repeat chorus]
Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line, cause you've got to see
[Repeat chorus x2]
In ten, ten seconds
Ten, ten seconds
Ten!

[lyrics: Les]
Fettered with the olden ice
Blown with the gale of oblivion
Masters of duration
We stay in the chaos of calm
Let's soar to the sky in red
Lost land calls us
Let's free our souls
Dip them in the life's infinity
Let's mount winged beasts
Horizon is our goal
Let the whirlwind of death carry our fleet
Blackness of the sky is the shelter of our storm
Our rights paid dearly with our lives ago
Rebel souls
Our names are swords of hatred
Our names have never been spoken by a mortal
[lead: LES]
[lead: BART]
Blackness of the sky is the shelter of our storm
Our rights paid dearly with our lives ago
Who's that figure gliding in the sky of death
Dark messenger from the abyssland

In my parent's eyes, I'm a child of sin.
Black sheep of the family, blessed be insanity.
Down with the lambs, up with the lark.
Run to bed my children now, before it gets dark.
Family life, forbidden to find.
Searching her love, within the black depths of a septic mind.
Barred from my mother's love, please let me in.
I was born unto a child of sin.
A child of sin - her love becomes my lust.
Raped my own kin - mother ashes to dust.
Bearing no marks of evil, blamed for my acts of mercy.
Come lay you down upon the bed,
my imagination of your severed head.
The dead loved parents, and the deviant son.
Family life now that we are one.
Is this the confused mind of a boy?
Or does a oreature lurk within?
Am I possessed by eternal entities?
Or are my urges born of my own fears?
Mother mutilation!
Witness malign grin, born unto a vicious child of sin.

Run for your lives, death has arrived
Try save your soul, run from the sound of rowing oars
Out of the mist
Breaks a dragon ship
Even more feared
Than the nail-ship "Naglfar"
A bear-coated man stands in the bow
Cold-eyed he gazes towards the shoer
The dragon's head is grim and red
All covered with blood, a gift to the mighty Gods
Warshields are raised, the Gods are praised
The people stare paralyzed with fear
The legend tells of a man that fell
From grace of his baptised king
As a banished man he fled his land
But solemnly sworn to return with holy war
But no one knows how the legend goes
'Cause noones survived
That's gazed into his eyes
'Cause no one's returned that's met his fire
They say wolf-skinned men follow him
Berserks whose eyes burn with flames of ice
Some say mighty Thor
Guides their blades in war
They say they cannot be killed
Nor can their blood be spilled
So run for your lives
Death has arrived
The legend has come
To take the lives of the deceitful ones
Run for your lives
The death ship's arrived
There's no way you'll live
To tell of meeting his fire

I can't believe existence is confined to this life
And I can't tell the difference between the truth and lies
Surreality, surreal, reality
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind?
Sometimes it seems that being is all within my mind
In truth I'm seeking comfort, too difficult to find
Infernal lobe resistance, fact and fiction are the same
Please let all the answers be unleashed from my brain
I can't believe existence is confined to this life
And I can't tell the difference between the truth and lies
I can't believe existence, is confined to this life
And I can't tell the difference, between the truth and lies
Surreality, surreality
Surreality, surreal, reality
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind?
Surreality, surreality
Surreality, surreal, reality
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind?

Look at the world through my eyes
I won't be happy until everything dies
I wish you could see this life from the inside
But you'll go fucking blind
You've got it good looking in from the outside
You'll lose your fucking mind
Look at the world from my eyes
I won't be happy until everything dies x2
There is nothing in this world that comes without a price
Everything you think you know is a fucking lie
This isn't where your father passed you your life
My father gave me mine and then he fucking died
Look at the world through my eyes
I won't be happy until everything dies
Close your eyes and think about the times
The reality is your all going to die
This is how the world ends
Not with a bang but with a whimper x2
Let's just stand in silence and face the apocalypse
Not with a bang but with a whimper

The path I walked is now
covered in dust of contrition
as you say I've lost my way
The nights getting clouded over
I hear the echo of your call
Sweet words softly weaving
My eyes are open and bleeding
One way or another
Has never been the right direction
Our sky or another
Could be on reflection
I'm looking up if the stars sign
The afterlife that is to be mine
And wonder if you let them shine
Alive or dead, but not dead yet
Widdershins and hence we fly
The left hand path
Attract a wicked mind
Backwards we walk thru
The maze of life we spent
A new beginning could be the end
I'm lookin' up and the stars sign
Our afterlife that you are to be mine
Don't wonder just let them shine
Widdershins and hence we fly
The left hand path
Attract a wicked mind
Alive or dead, but not dead yet
You dance around me
Widdershins and the two tormented souls met

winds on winter fields
in the smokey sky
wandering storm
storming war
demons' lust in starving lands
the years are filled with lies and tears
no twinkling stars in distant skies
our fear is masked with careless smiles
where are the gods, where is their might
nightmares guard our life
they are lost in the midnight air
forever lost
love can't fill their empty lungs with breath
will there be salvation, a ray of grace
as soon as grief began it shall end
it shall end
while i stand
it shall end as soon as it began
it shall end
silent fading
it shall end
give us back understanding

Hey, would you hear me?
The out of it kid wants to be accepted
Will you listen? Got my mail with a giant will
Now I got a bed made of ten dollar bills
Always knew luck was on my good side
Now I'm laughing at you
No use trying to pry into my life
Now I'm laughing at you
What a laugh?
Concealed guilt
Friends for life is your motto
Can't believe it
Sneaky move, just been proved
Now it's your turn to take abuse
Always knew luck was on my good side
Now I'm laughing at you
Double dealer
I'm aware what you do
Foolish maneuver
I can see right through
Get away, get away from me
Get away, get away, you leech
Now I'm laughing at you
No use trying to pry into my life
Now I'm laughing at you
Waitin' for me? See, I'm leavin'

Theres no need to be as wise as Solomon
To see that world has mired down
We cant see the end, cant see the end
We are accountable for our actions
The way we choose determines our future
Have you ever thought that its not right
To live your life
Without any sort of aspiration
Were not the ones that you will listen to
But we just wanted to share our experience
Nobody likes to suffer
Then why do we make suffer others
Its not right to make your life go down the drain
Perhaps it would be better to stop and think
It would be better to stop and think
Use your head
Light the torch
A lot of days are ahead and each of them is important
Dont waste your time its going fast
Too many things went wrong
Time is up (x2)
Dont be the one who doesnt care
Indifference is like abyss
It will swallow you
So try to make the right choice

When your soul is free to wander, where would it go?
Do you think it is safe with God in heaven?
But what if the angels took over his power and might
They could torment it ofr milleniums to come
Oh, angelface, who's side are you on
It's a war, the second war, and the heavens shall burn
You could be the victim of Gabriels jealousy
Escaping Lucifer and his hungry hellish flames
You mortal fool with your naive heavenly devotion
Your beloved guardian angel is now tightening the skrew
It's a war, the second war, and the heavens shall burn
[lead - Henri]
Oh, angelface, who's side are you on
Into a dark Millenium

Never again
On your force fed illusions to choke
You feed off my pain
Fee off my life
There won't be another dawn
We will reap as we have sown
Always the same
My tired eyes have seen enough
Of all of your lies
My hate is blind
There won't be another dawn
We will read as we have sewn
Slaughter of the soul
Suicidal final art
Children born of sin
Tear your soul apart
Always the same
My tired eyes have seen enough
Of all of your lies
My hate is blind
There won't be another dawn
We will read as we have sewn
Slaughter of the soul
Suicidal final art
Children born of sin
Tear your soul apart
Men must attempt to develop
In themselves and their children
Liberation from the sense of self
Men must be free from boundaries, patterns and
Consistences in order to be free
To think, feel and create in new ways

Disgraceful, the evil done by false prophets in God's name
Profit from intimidating poor, lost souls into the flock
Selling a grand facade, pompous posturing in vain
Reinforce spiritual weakness, insecurity
Forgotten essential, freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded, kindness affected
Right or wrong, coerce the congregation mob
To abide your tumid words, the only god they know
Selective agenda with no foundation in truth
Corruption, stumbling block, ruined credibility
Vulgar salesmen growing fat, lies you tell consume your sheep
Crucify the innocent, absolve yourself with dollar bills
Self-righteous, presuming, cast stones of hypocrisy
Impose your nauseating, senseless fantasy
Built on payment, not contrition, speciously redeemed
Iniquity, punishment on anyone who disobeys
Forgotten essential, the freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded, kindness affected
Selling out redemption you will never grasp
Disgrace all men of faith
Self-righteous, presuming, cast stones of hypocrisy
Impose your nauseating, senseless fantasy
Built on payment, not contrition, speciously redeemed
Iniquity, punishment on anyone who disobeys
Unwillingness to accept reality
Myopic grip on the words of men
Blind loyalty without faith, service to an institution
Betraying trust, and our liberty
Sin of greater depth than those you would save
Blaming tragedy on our intolerance
You spent your life as a sordid pharisee
Unjust, don't be shocked when you're barred from Paradise

Hang the pope, hang the pope...
Hang him with this rope
Let's go to the Vatican
Get him out of bed
Put the noose around his neck
And hang him 'til he's dead

Bruising minds burning thoughts over matter
Your knees hit soil you touch me not
Curdled opinions form mindless babble
From evolved me the pity is not
Elevated threshold of pain
Masterpiece of the unsane
Miles away from the next to be
Successors of pure violent misery
[Solo: Tony]
Grind down to human
Resist against pleasure insist on pain
I disregard the soul in me
Along with it I replace pity

In the eyes of the mighty domain and its evil
Doctrines, there is no trace of romance
But the fears that grow
no one can watch his next into the eyes
You killed the poetry of mine
A long time ago - NOW
How many times have you given me rage
When your words were mendacious
And your laughter insane, how many times
Have you written lampoons about my life
And desires, about my pleasure and pain
I bare my fangs to you, look at my face and
You'll stare into my mind and you'll watch
The eyes of the tyrant - eyes of the night
The eyes of the tyrant - eyes of the night
Back from the hades, into the daylight
Back from the hades, into the daylight
King of tonight, tell me what should I do
Should I die in glory, should I raise my fist
The Crime of my deads is the frolic I need
I won't die on my knees, I will kill to resist
The chagrin of the damned cries the tears of
Romance, lord of uprightness take me now
The empire of the sad, the empire of the mad
My feelings were killed so long ago
Yeah, we are eternal, we are immortal
There is a trace of glory in our hands
Majestic and wild, we stand and we fight
Soon your blackened pride will be fading away
You'll realize you'll had been walking astray
Never tame the wicked, I'm a tyrant tonight
Back from the hades, into the light
Back from the hades into:
Uh, now here we go

never-ending
this barren land is never-ending
never-ending
when will this season of bloodloss end?
hope falls through the holes in my hands
every hour is a shackle I curse my captor
every divinity has forsaken me
I curse my birth I curse this life
I worship the God of slumber
for death and sleep walk hand in hand
these eyes will never lie

My life turns into sand
Immortality is my dream
Man shall follow my command
Sorcery shall conquer my fear
Astral magic and runic wand
I feel that wisdom's near
Across the mountain's ice
Scarlett at the equinox' dawn
I sacrificed an innocent lamb
And drunk the wine of paradise
But, still run the sands of time
Just one thing yet to be done
As spell surround me
At a light mass' night
He raised the abyss
Covered by the sword

Take away the wine
For restlessness plagues me
I am assailed by a spectre profounder
Than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime
I shalt suffer this confessional mime
Awaiting the sun to set, crimsoning seas
Only once it is dark doth my misery cease
She died to a sky dressed in flame
Eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
Who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
"I am as dusk come to ravish the light"
Steal me from their stares and mute Christ into night
"I will answer thy prayers"
If thou Wouldst drink of my life
Encroaching evening skies
Die with such tragedy
And those interred in cold graves
Dwell on pleasures to be
In deep hysteria
Where our legend still breathes
Through sweet death and thereafter
Sweeping nightmares shalt feed

There's going to be no more boredom I'm going to cut my hair
After the men, women and children falling through the air
The monsters have landed on Maple Street
The lynch mobs marching off to their defeat
If I was young I would sign up for a gun
And as it is I might just go out and buy one
Now I can understand I could just kill a man
After sending in bombs to flatten his land
We never knew a life of faith never toughed it out
Now we're going to find out what's it's all about
Looking everywhere in the water in the air
The next shot is coming but from where?
You hold a gun at my kid's head and what am I to do?
Could I wear a peace sign and to myself be true?
Oh, let the Mount of Olives tear and Wormwood poison from the air Don't mind me don't give me a care
I'm just enraged
"Allah" is crying as He looks down upon it all
The bridges between us will be the first to fall
Should the government have not stuck our nose everywhere?
Yes I think so but it's too late to go elsewhere
Now we're committed blood flowing on our soil
Now we've been dragged back in like Michael Corleone
And I ask the peace movement where did you go?
When Clinton sent bombers into Kosovo
For all the terrorizing I'm not too terrified
I mourn for the loss of innocent lives
I should have mourned before, our bombers filled their skies
When it was none of our business when they were out of our lives
But the lives of the guilty are there to be taken
Striking precisely with an aim unshaken
Let the computers point let the satellites fly
Let technology shield the homeland sky
I'm so enraged
Terror is but a weapon wielded by ideologues
Who have said it's either them or us
Don't want to fight a religion but some want to fight us
The future of freedom is starting to look tough
An enemy could be rid by becoming a friend
The lives that have suffered could be won in the end
For the thirst for freedom will never be slaked
The blood and darkness might give rise to a new day

What, say one word and you die
And I'll make you see
the real fucking bitch you've been
You, you never see the death
I outta show you way
When i get along to kill you fucking bitch
Go!
So, you better step back
Cause I ain't gonna tell
To why you pull the pain from me
What, and all I say is strong
To you are true apart
I tell you fucking bitch you died
when i will fuck down
Feel in together world
I'll take it to me
Asshole are shove me down
(Hey), do you never let it go ? save from my time
If I tell, knuckleduster beat you six feed under
(So), so I kill you as fucking insane and I don't swear you see it again
Did you know, knuckleduster beat you six feed under
When i will fuck down
Feel in together world
I'll take it to me
Never be some I afraid
(Hey), do you never let it go ? save from my time
(Bitch!) If I tell, knuckleduster beat you six feed under
(So), so I kill you as fucking insane and I swear you see it again
Did you know, knuckleduster beat you six feet under

Open those eyes, wake from peace
Orders are some favorite color
Same old, same old is their battle cry
Why don't we keep searching for a new flavor?
Our hearts have become a routine
Worthy kings have broken backs for nothing
Unless we cherish all with pride
The lines on our face will turn
Into canyons of sorrow instead of hope
They didn't die from the cold without
But they died from the cold within
And I just can't stop denying
That our brothers are in miserable pain
Stop short, lend a hand and break the chains
Of regularity that you lean so closely upon

These words are a weapon for the ones in pain
A fair fight for the children of a lesser name
We are the war against the sick and fatal fall of man
A hollow tip to the notion of a Godless stand
Quick to slam the gavel on a true solution
You let the fear become a stranglehold
Tear it all apart so you can render your own belief
You never listened to what you were told
Condemned
You built a wall, disbelief is all you left us
Reaction
Without a thought, your resolve is to reject us
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
And all you wanted was perfection
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
So all you are is contradiction
You buried the chance in a self-righteous glance
So your sons and your daughters were safe
But your imperfect path is a heart made of glass
And the world is a charming grenade
Condemned
You built a wall, disbelief is all you left us
Reaction
Without a thought, your resolve is to reject us
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
And all you wanted was perfection
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
So all you are is contradiction

A dawn on the run, nowhere to hide in a life of
Corruption, insanity has won, living in hate
And preaching destruction
I'm screaming tonight, my vengeance
To fight has killed all morality
The cries of the toll and madness control
And liberate my energy
Axe to the wax !
Misguidin' your life, you'll reach
The empire of madness
I will be rife, driven by insanity or hate
Misguidin' your life, you'll reach
The empire of madness
I will be rife, driven by insanity
Lunacy and rage are raving in my head, reign
Back to back, c'mon be my slave, the beauty
In your face will be fading to black

Turning the knife buried in your stomach
I woke up alive black with stain
Glistening and new the sunset's coming
Finger paintings of the insane
Come on and sterilize me
Kneel down and idolize me
Suck me, fuck me, resurrect me
Rut me, cut me and infect me
Slice me, dice me I wanna die screamin'
The thoughts of dead babies wiped away with my semen
Bleed me, feed me and inject me
Feel me, kill me then dissect me
The pigs will squeal their blood will drain
Finger paintings of the insane
Slice the throat of authority
Imagining infinity
Greasy smoke billows into the sky
Coach roach dreams, the human dust of pain
Twitching screaming hide your razor face
Finger paintings of the insane
Bloody mountain momma rockabilly machine
Kiddy porn lover with a mouth for disease
Giddy 'up honey my rubber fuck doll
When your candle's snuffed out I'll burn brighter than before
Pink poinsettias for emotion that died
A chilling wargasm that feels like cyanide
Her pussy bleeds sunshine, rabid for flesh
As each raindrop plunges to its death

Ground is shaking
Waves are breaking
The wind has lost control
The air is shifting while
It's lifting force fools gravity
A huge eruption
Vast explosions
As it bursts the earth
Water's pounding
Waves are sounding
Deadly and extreme
"But we are equally destructive"
Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine
And it's endless stream
Alarming silence predicts
The violence that is yet to come
We are senseless
Proud while blindness
Is catching up with us
We must measure while
The pressure of nature's force expands
We feel minor, punished and meager
Betrayed by all our gods
"We are a part of it
We are equally destructive"
Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine
And its endless stream

Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Crowded by all that is lost, it's hard to find positives
Taken by blunt ignorance I give you no forgiveness
Don't try to block out all the memories, it's the pain that binds us
All to this cause we unite to burn the cancer
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Battle rages day to day, fought by our sons and daughters
All support is fading, it raises speculation
It's not just one man, but a fungus that is slowly closing in on the world
smothering all of existance
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Who decides what is right
Fear is fuel for cowards, throw a match into the fuel
Don't think that all is lost, read between the burning towers
This hit should make us strong, aggravated by their treachery
No end in sight, blinding, wish I could see the future
Day in day out questioning, what is tommorrow bringing
Though we are whithered and beaten we cannot be broken
Fear of your pride, misery is soon upon us
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Who decides what is right
Fear is fuel for cowards, throw a match into the fuel
Don't think that all is lost, read between the burning towers
This hit should make us strong, aggravated by what it's coming to
What is it coming to, every time you turn the page you can see our world is a disaster
Rage rears its' ugly head in so many different ways
So deafening, our world is a disaster
Lost on a globe of disregard, clinging onto hope
We need to find... what really matters.

Music: Niclas Karlsson - Lyrics: Niclas Karlsson
Armies crossed the border. We know how it end
Listen to their orders. They have no demand
Missiles fills the sky, the ground is turning red
Children and women cry, they die in their beds
See them stand in line, proud young men
Soon they will feed their minds. Who cares for them?
Greed is taking over. Hate and self destruction
Tyrants rule the world. Power corruption
Pre Chorus:
We have done it for ages and we always will
Always fighting each other. We're in for the kill
Chorus:
We are the future
What shall we give to our heir?
We can't go on like this
When shall we start to care?
Bridge:
When there are two men left in the world
Fighting each other to rule the earth
Solo: Karlsson
Pre Chorus:
Chorus:

I will not give in to fanciest beliefs and I am not a fool
I will not let pride in my core be rooted out
I will stand firm on my beliefs
Live life the master of my destiny
See no other way to live
I am not the weak willed
Nor am I a fool who can not see
I am not the weak willed
I will not let pride destroy me
Wise men can see the difference in compromise
And laying down ones beliefs
There shall be wisdom in my beliefs
They shall be rooted in strength not failure
With lies on your tong seek to deceive
You've fallen victim to the human condition
And it's lead to your defeat
I am not the weak willed
Nor am I a fool who can not see
I am not the weak willed
I will not let pride destroy me
I will not let pride destroy me

("No! this face is only a mask a wicked ornament,
Illuminated by an exquisite grimace,
Look and see, atrociously controlled,
The real head, and the sincere face
Turned back under the shadow of the face which lies."
Charles Baudelaire )
He is profanity in sanctity's guise
An alias assumed I do recognize
In their eyes, his cause
When enticing and cunning in impact
Is still a criminal and evil act.
So look for him vainly, He,
The incarnation of evil: And by
Arrangements of magical nature
He turns unrecognizable even to the
Experienced eye.
You obsessively pursue him
Falling to see, that was why he came to be
One who annihilates with such impunity
He appears your friend, but
The Saint hides many Satan's
He's contemptuous, you know
Of your God given stupidities
He calls you in question which
Affected modesty and create
Of you an object of derision
You think him to be the pariah
Whom company does exclude
But in the midst of all frenzy
He is, feasting in a transitory mood
Passion is strict lord
He is also its humble slave
When bereft of common ways,
He strides before you on water
He makes clowns of kings,
Charms the guests, rides the ball
Is the master of disguise
Prince of the thousandfold face
The charming jester's smile
Which invites reason to demise,
And imaginations rise
Inscrutable yes, venting his spleen
Somewhere night and day between
Is the master of disguise

You turned to senseless stone
I can't breathe in your ears anymore
I never knew the tide of life
It's time for leaving
I'm not believing in you anymore
Your needles in my heart
My nonexistent trust I must endure
I yearn for sympathy
Und doch beruhr ich kalte nur
It's a biting cold
Living flame shining dead
It's my next defeat
It's a biting cold again
It's a biting cold
Striking mights and maybes even more
A useless thing called life
It's a biting cold again
My hollow hand holds the past
Where your hand once was placed
Just the shell of a life
I once have lived with you
Now I know the taste of tears
They cut my soul in two
Like a knife, sharpened knife
Like a bloody sharpened knife
Cut me...
Losing my bright illusions
I will resign, become a rusty wreck
My nonexistent trust I must endure
I yearn for sympathy
Und doch beruhr ich kalte nur
You divided us forever
I will never ever heal

Rise!
It is our will to awaken the "Dead"
Crawl up from you graves
Rise!
It is our will to rid you of all chains
With these words, with this speech...
Death By Hell/Death By Thrash
Total destruction! Total devastation!
Armies of the "dead". World incineration.
Death by Thrash/Death by Hell
THRASH/DEATH/HELL/HAIL!
Funeral Thrash
Hate-ammoed funeral thrash upon you
Chrome hooves trample "God's" creation
Force-fed foetus puppets...
Of all that is holy
Blasphemed by thy name
All arms raise, praise the Goat!
Death by Thrash/Death by Hell

I think I'd be better off alone
locked away inside a room without any doors
Is this really what i was meant to be
is this really all there is for me
someone tell me that theres something more then this
could i be better off asleep
the small hand slowly ticks a way
reminding me again that its just a passing phase
a cigarette to calm my nerves
anything to pass the time and passify the hurt
Someone wake me when this is over
Someone tell me when this is over
Someone wake me when this is over
Someone wake me when this is over

An unseen force tears through your soul
Revealing memories, past life unknown
Fervent emotions from deep within
Inner transformation now begins
Life before, you cannot conceive
Thoughts repressed, denial to believe
Precise identity, you cannot tell
Existing inside this mortal shell
Summon the powers that dominate
Grasp your inner strength, seize control of hate
A forgotten past, a life of normality
This sudden transition redirects your destiny
Consumed with resentment, hatred you now possess
Potency awakened from eternal rest
Through invocation to an existence you detest
What has become of your humility?
Corrupted through change to anguish and misery
As man's preordained fate now closes in
You're a silent witness to what dwells within
As man judges all by outward impressions
Our status is classed through amounting possessions
Whilst shrouding the truth through deceitful expression
Injustice presides by a judicious obsession

Before all else, better get yourself armed yeah
Watch as they gravitate to your irresistible charm
Yeah, irresistible, irresistible
Who is going to guard the guards themselves
If you always lay down in the name of help
The paupers learn quick or fall to the side
It's all me myself and I
Who is going to guard the guards themselves
When all you do is try to survive the pelts
The paupers learn quick or fall to the side
I live me myself, me myself and I
Don't look to heaven, cause you think that
Your due reward
You think you do?
In my hand is a chisel
For the chip on my shoulder
I can't afford no

you were always my everything
but sometimes ou were all I had
don't be surprised at the contempt in my voice
why should you be?
you have used your every word against me
you are deception personified
your illusions no longer hold me
I lost faith in what my eyes beheld
sightless my every turn
has been met with futility
what little I could perceive
ensnared my progress
lost lost in darkness i only fell faster
I followed you faithfully it was to no avail
I held you in the highest of places
and you let me down you failed me
I want my blood to ignite you hands
and you let me down you failed me

In the fight for existence and life
There is no law
And in the presence of eternal death
There is no law
And just the struggle for power, the domination prevails
An arising slaughter
In [Incomprehensible], every man for himself
As in battle there is no law
Countless numbers die in war's path
Armies falling to our wrath
Warriors of power marching to fight
Destruction, killing, all that's in sight
Raise the shield or be cast in to death
Take a final, look your final breath
Innocent victims of war
No turning back, in battle there is no law
Awaiting the slaughter, time stands still
Thoughts fade away, so does your will
Enemy close in, blood on their mind
You won't die once, die a thousand times
Raise the shield or be cast in to death
Take a final look your final breath
Innocent victims of war
No turning back, in battle there is no law
Soldiers of hatred, killing corps of war
Bodies litter the field, what was it for?
Stench of death, no victory for this night
Plead for mercy, you have no right
Raise the shield or be cast in to death
Take a final, look your final breath
Innocent victims of war
No turning back, in battle there is no law
No law
No law

Waiting for something to come out of the dark
I know I have seen him, his presence is cold
Wherever he's moving, he's leaving his mark
Thunder and lightning strikes, and hell unfolds
Ruler of shadows is coming to cross
The open fields where his soldiers fought
No sign of sadness no remorse for the loss
He's in command of the souls that he's caught
the flowers will wither and the air will be dry
The king of the dark side will goodness defy
Starlight will fade and the sun will turn black
Clouds will explode and the surface will crack
He will rule until eternity ends
He will rule until eternity ends
King of fire
the darkness will swallow, all life will be dead
There's no solution into death you'll be led
The fire and the odor of burning remains
Mother earth is fading trembling in pains
the leaves have now fallen
Buried in the soil
The water in the oceans is starting to boil
Sunlight is killing - hell in advance
Onto the dead earth the devils will dance
He will rule until eternity ends
He will rule until eternity ends
King of fire
Now I am here at the end of my days
I feel the lord move in mysterious ways
Now I can feel this is the end for this place
I feel the lord will be giving no grace
He will rule until eternity ends
He will rule until eternity ends
King of fire

Can not a man of modern day
Find truth in what he's learned
Of all the seventh days a waste
A fool for all the lies I've prayed yet I'm strong
I'll place no blame
Although misled I've found the truth
This one belief, strength for this mortal dance
This one truth, I feel I'll be set free
This one faith, I know I'll not falter
This one belief, I know I'll be redeemed
The night once called to me
An eloquent caress she offered
But I'll not make my bed with whores
And in the place she left a harder yet much truer thing
And now by this I gauge the world
Strength for this mortal dance

You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide, you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life
Empty inside almost insane
Feel so lonely you're stuck to bare the pain
Only you can take control
Watch out before the hangman takes your soul
Don't hide there nowhere to run
No escaping from all the things you've done
It's time to face reality
There is no chance for you to feel
Falling, loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind
[Chorus]
You're down and out, you're lost in paradise
You're just a fool, a fraud filled with lies
You're in a land where shadows watching you
That land is only an illusion of life!
Watch out darkness will come on your way
Decide if you ever want to change
You're the one with the golden key
To the future and to your destiny
You need to find out who you are
Take my advice or else you wound get far
Stop pretending that you're the man
Guilty of charge it's time to take your stand
Falling loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind
[Chorus]
You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life!
[Chorus: x2]

Lyrics: From Nvaml
I know that I hung
in the windcold tree
nine whole nights
with hurt point
To Oden given
self given to myself
In that thee
which nobody knows
>From which roots it ran
Not given bread
they brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
took up runes
took them with screams
and down from the tree I fell
Nine magic songs I got
from the famous son of
Boltorn, Besdas Father
and a drink I got
of precious mead
poured by Odrere
Then I became vigorous
and got wise
grew and felt well
of word sought word
the word again
of work sought work
the work again
Music: Ivar Bjrnson 1994

The worship of creation
Seeming endless
But it will end
And every knee shall bow
Thoughts of a coincidental existence
And a futureless world corrodes into the
Spinal chord of the narcissistic man
A paradigm shift for worse
My ego is my god
Given authority by the enlightenment
Of science,
The enlightenment of the age of freedom
Freedom - the name in which we legalize all
The name in which we tolerate all
Credibility for truth, image for substance
Weakness and failure
- unbearable elements in life
Subtly opposed through an endless flow of
Constantly replaced trends, neither allowed
To mature nor to fade
The surroundings,
A mirror reflecting the signals
Of admiration that makes my identity
A constant egocentricity providing a
Purging of anything threatening popularity
The peak of this shallowness
Displayed by the so-called stars
In their quest for self-actualisation
This beautiful people experiencing
The illusion of narcissistic prosperity,
Uncritically and boundlessly admired,
Simply for their own sake

I don't know what it is
Inside me it takes the grip
Never letting go, it plays its game
Scrambling your mind, you're now trained
I try to stop it but!
It won't go away, I'm in its rut
God! Please try to spare me!
Take my soul and set it free
It won't leave me be
How can you set it free?
Please help me Lord
Spare my life, pull up on the cord
Give me the chance to live
The chance that I dreamt
The chance to give
If I knew for sure
I'd Spare The Pain, that I endured
I pray to God
For His help
What is wrong?
Only He can tell
[Repeat]
Why can't this just go away?
Is this the reason I have to pay?
What's there to hold me back?
Is this the way to keep intact?
I don't know what's going on
The life of God, please, don't be gone
[Repeat]

Demons
At night they call my name
Visions
Of my journey through the flames
Blackened eyes
Watching in the fire
Horned one
Awaits my soul in hell
Descended to the abyss
On a lifeless shore
Enshrouded in obscurity
The kingdom called my name
I saw the shadowed portals
Open before my eyes
Far away I saw the light
I entered through the chambers
In which the fire burns
The cries of damned souls
Echoed through the abyss
I gazed into the flames
Burning oh so bright
I threw myself into the deeps
Satan
Into the flames I fall
Eternally I burn
In the hellish deeps
Satan
Hell awaits my soul
Eternally I burn
Into the fire eternal
Dreamlike visions
Of a journey into hell
I burned for master satan
I burned for his throne
I heard the mournful voices
Of a thousand souls
Burning for eternity
I entered through the chambers
In which the fire burns
The cries of damned souls
Echoed through the abyss
I gazed into the flames
Burning oh so bright
I threw myself into the deeps

I'm broken, I'm hoping
For a reason to keep on going
Doors open and closing
Everything seems like slow motion
I've chosen this moment
To stop my self-erosion
I'm focused on owning
Myself, my own opponent
But in this moment that is falling apart
I keep thinking
Is the path I chose where I should start?
I keep sinking
I'm dying every second I'm alive
Every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that inside me
The fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive
This life's reflection in my eye
It reminds me the scars made me stronger
I won't go quietly
Won't let the past unwind me
I don't know whom I see
Worth trying to put behind me
But in this moment that is falling apart
I keep thinking
Is the path I chose where I should start?
I keep sinking
I'm dying every second I'm alive
Every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that inside me
The fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive
This life's reflection in my eye
It reminds me the scars made me stronger
Every second I'm alive
I'm getting closer to my grave
I try my best to just survive
Feels like I'm broken every day
I'm hoping that I'll make it
I'm hoping but I'm flaky
I'm cold inside this basement
Time to try and fight the shaky
I'm shaking and I'm waiting
Still debating on which way to go
Swaying and I'm fading
No escaping, still afraid to know
Inside my thoughts are erasing
So I'm bracing for a weighted stone
The world is so much colder
So I may just have to change alone
I'm dying every second I'm alive
Every second I'm alive
I'm trying to feed the fire that inside me
The fire that's inside
I'm dying every second I'm alive
This life's reflection in my eye
It reminds me the scars made me stronger

Burning fires, burning lives
On the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless
So far away from home
Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
Forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
On towards our destiny we travel far and wide
Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die
In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
When the time has come for the battle now we follow with the horde
We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again
Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day
Can't you see the history the suffocating madness
In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
I have traveled far and wide across this wasteland
Still searching for the answers for the right to understand
Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
Riding through the starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
Our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
Blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come

Red clouds always surrender to the nightfall.
But still there is a million ants,
swarning on the ground.
Spirits will come in a blurred shape
I just have to wait, it's a matter of time.
Walking through the fields of light,
I can free myself from my soul
Fly away my pain on the wind.
The divine breath of night
Entices me into the maze of my soul
For truth an inner struggle
Of which I'm the keeper.
Bear witness to my strength
waking in me, leaving my weakness behind
For truth an inner struggle
Of which I'm the keeper
As a new life runs into my veins
I just leave the past behind
And on the wings of hope I try to be
Walking through the fields of light,
I can free myself from my soul
Fly away my pain on the wind.

[Black Widow Cover]
[Bonus Track]
In ancient days in other lives, long past, but not forgotten,
I've known the power of mind and flesh, to have my will obeyed
In Adonai and Babylon, Etruscans and Egyptians
Came to my temple - journeyed to the valley of the Moon
Deep underground where no light dared to come,
beneath my pyramid,
I stood in Hell, a mortal man, between Belial and Satan,
And still before my audience entranced with stark, cold fear;
I cured or struck with sickness, death, or made insane my foes
Yet here, in my thirteenth life, the mystic power of old
Returns and as I say these words, my soul again in Hell.
I conjure thee,
I conjure thee,
I conjure thee,
I conjure thee appear,
I raise thee mighty demons, come before me,
Join me here...

You gotta keep those wheels of mine
Rolling and burning down the highway
Last night that girl of mine left me yearning
Best start learning to see things my way
Hit me for the very first time
And we're gonna turn around
I'm leaving her love behind
And getting out of town
I won't back down
I won't turn round
From the last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn
Gonna keep these old wheels going covering ground
Last night that girl of mine left me trying
And lying she deceived me
[I'll alter] all these tears with the wipers
You'd better believe me
She said she was mine alone
But I know otherwise
I thought she was mine alone
I saw her with a guy
I want her back
It's all in the past
That's why l'm last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
She said she was mine alone
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
I saw her with a guy
And that's the reason why
I'll pass the last
The last exit to Brooklyn
The last chance to turn around

Reality, my one last escape
I can't hid deep inside myself
I close my eyes
Try to cover my ears
I'm obsessed
No peace to be found
Three churches with minarets
On three hills, far away
Every church has a bell
Piercing chime
Resonates in my head
[Lead: Schalin]
One for faith, holy faith
Roars like hell
One for hope, bloody hope
One for love
Tinkling fuck
Optical delusions
Unheard sounds
Haunting me, why?
These symbols I can't understand
Or interpret
I open my eyes
To escape from this hell
Although reality bites
Reflection I can spare
Three windmills now appear
New visions but I don't care
Two in spin and one is still
Eyes now burn
Sound intensified
Eardrums blow
Delirious delirium!
[Lead: Schalin]
He never solved the riddle
Never tried
Cursed to die!
[Lead: Allenmark]
Never reached
The insight that I have
Led to his demise
So learn from this...
If you are a stormy sea
Hold the mill-sails
If your soul is ground
I prithee mark my words
Your soul torn apart
By the sound of the bells
Misled by visions
You will expire
Concentrate, gather strength
Don't let the chime
Get to you or your soul
If you're strong
No mill can grind your soul
Not even if you are
A stormy sea

Metal on metal
It's what I crave
The louder the better
I'll turn in my grave
Metal on metal
Ears start to bleed
Cranking it up
Fulfilling my need
Metal on metal
Shakin' the place
Blows back your hair
Caves in your face
Metal on metal
Feeling the grind
Up go the hammers
A victim to find
Metal on metal
Heads start to bang
Denim and leathers
Chains that clang
Keep on rockin'
Keep on rockin'
To this metal tonight
Keep on pounding
Keep on pounding
Join the heavy metal fight
Metal on metal
Gets you so high
Excitement and action
Won't pass you by
Metal on metal
The hardened breed
True to the end
A fire to feed
Metal on metal
Heat starts to rise
Kickin' it out
With screams and cries
Metal on metal Never will die
Parties and concerts
Keep it alive
Metal on metal
It's the only way
To hell with tomorrow
Let's live for today

Fight, Priest, fight, take pictures
Make alright what you have lost
And give pride back to the ground
(Fight, Priest, take pictures)
You've got all you want
But all you've got is a wreck
Everyone in this whole wide world
Wake up and panic
Fortune wears a red dress
But her bones smell of death
Fortune wears a red dress
But her bones smell of death
They all stare but no one seeks
They all claim but no one speaks
They all hear what they want
Panic, Preacher
Beware of these sheep
In the costume of wolves
For lies, they come in pairs of two
And we only die twice
But for such a very long time
And just because you kiss
Don't mean you're in love
And just because you've begun
Don't mean you've won
I was a second child
Not born but just once
And all my friends be gray
They all close the door
Because no one speaks out loud
The fade out
They're all fading out
We're all fading out
Take my heart, Prophet
Take my heart, Prophet
Take my heart, Prophet
Take my heart, Prophet
Take my heart, Prophet

Become...
Become...
We've cut in, cut out
The face of man
Cut in, cut out
The face of...
Time has given us no reason to live
Look to the future and you will see nothing
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
We've lost hope, lost fate
We've lost our way
Lost time, lost grace
We search for...
Man has taken time from all that you see
Look in his eyes, see the future hold nothing
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
Man has taken time from all that you see
Look in his eye and you still will not see
No! You will not see (x3)
No! You wil not...
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see out own eternity
What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see our eternity
What will become?
What will become?
What will become?
What will become of us?

In your face written in, carved in stone
Here comes that feeling once again
Pop the lid, down we go
Falling fast though the undertow
Missing link crossing path
Bleeding eyes see your fractured past
Point of your vision clear
You'll never...
Cut to the point leaving nothing to hide
Nothing to hide
Out of breath, out of time
You're out of time
You opened it up just to see what's inside
What's inside?
Seek your truth limb to limb
You'll wish you never asked again
Piled up in your mind asked again
Piled up in your mind you'll never...
Level the wall that you've built up inside
Pushed to far this time
Should have never opened it
Just couldn't let it sit
Should of never questioned it
Should of never opened that can of worms
When you popped the lid they crawl across the floor
Watch em writhing everywhere
They're everywhere
When you popped the lid did they fall across the floor
Watch em crawling everywhere
Pop the lid and down we go
It's everywhere, they're everywhere
pop the lid so now you know
They're everywhere, it's everywhere
They're everywhere

You bastards
Redeem me now that I have lost
Now, what have I gained from this?
This is a curse for me
Still I long to be set free
The self is set on fire
Out comes the exit
Like a serpent sun
The flames break loose
Release me now that doom is here
I will never settle for anything less
Than the truth in this great divide
The self is set on fire
Out comes the exit
Like a serpent sun
The flames break loose
Eruptions of red leave scars upon the scars
Vultures circle overhead, starving to pick the bones we leave
In this wasteland I lie deathless in the sand
Redeemed to form evil once again
O heroic, deliver me, let me outlive this
In the wake of collisions
This is our time to rise, through adversity
In the wake of collisions
Deploy me now that hope remain
Now that we filled once again
This fate comes easy for me again
O heroic, deliver me, let me outlive this
In the wake of collisions
This is our time to rise, through adversity
In the wake of collisions
You bastard
Eruptions of red
Now desolation comes as my paradise
This is my time to rise
Upon the tyrant throne
You bastard.
Desolation
You ride the answer you make me tell
Eruptions of red
You reap

No talk of the future
So far from forever
Approaching tomorrow
But hoping for never
Cursed, we are cursed
Condemned to die from our birth
How many footsteps in line
Have flattened this land?
How many prophets have died
Right here where we stand?
Call, some call
Is answered in warning us all
These "signs" which surround us
Imagining most of
Some commitment urges us
To bring down all around us
Wish, this wish
Bent on ceasing to exist
How many questions have tried
To uncover some truth?
How many prophets have lied
Inventing the proof?
Call, some call
IS answered to sentence us all
To sentence us all
Call, some call
Unanswered, awaiting our fall
So many footsteps
Too many prophets
So many questions
Too many prophets
Too many prophets

So many years I've been fading
And closed the doors behind
Pay that price if you lost it all
The end is not the past recall
Waiting for the enclosing darkness
And there you will be the light
As it's carved in your soul
Step out from your mould
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has its sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has its sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away
It's all too clear you've been hiding
Nothing to tell but lies
Feel the shame when you disdain it all
Your stand is not the past recall
Waiting for the enclosing darkness
And there you will be the light
As it's carved in your soul
Step out from your mould
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has its sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has its sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has its sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has its sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away, turn away

By burial this night
Nitocrys weaves the spell
Down the vault's misty light
The lurking Sphinx dwells
Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one
In the nuclear domain
Arcades lost in eternal skries
Written by the insane
Nitocrys orders must
Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one
Mummy's rebirth by wrath
Below the temple of nile
Vanished in Osiris' path
Above us reigns the Necrophile
Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one
Morbid Tales

Welcome to my hell
welcome to the spell
Cadavers, monsters and witches as well
all together in my hell
ring for you Satan's bell
this is the end can't you tell.
Welcome here tonight
in this place you have to fight
When some devils turn on the light
you will see this evil sight.
Welcome to my sin
nothing to lose, nothing to win
there's no pleasure, see what I mean
like a nightmare it will seem
your soul will fight and your mind will dream
you'll be weak as you've never been.
Welcome to the reign of blood
as you enter start to shout
and your scream will be so loud
when you find there's no way out.

Tough times ahead of me
Tough times behind
I fight for my life; I fight 'till I die,
I fight to save my mind.
It's justified violence,
It burns from within.
Sometimes a man must fight,
It's not always a sin.
It's not a sin!
Justified violence.
Justified violence.
An innocent victim becomes the pun,
hate thriving fools in search of some fun.
It's not fun to fight ten to one.
Some won't accept it
that you won't conform;
Like bees upon honey
the animals swarm;
Unjust acts come back to you, I warn.
Chorus (2x)
Those who don't fight fair,
you'd best beware.
Fight to be yourself.
Do unto others
as you'd have done to you.
A beating was given in an unfair fight.
Revenge is planned, a posse in the night.
Street justice decides wrong from right.
For the blood and honor
the sucker will pay;
We will show them the meaning of prey.
Today is judgment day.
Chorus (2x)
When you're lying face down
and you're part of the ground,
What comes around goes around--
justified violence.
When you're down in the streets,
get back on your feet.
Defending your pride for justified
violence.
Justified violence.
Justified violence.
Justified violence.

There'll be a time
Where I can take what they've taught and make it work
THIS would be a better place if you could free you mind of thought
THOUGH to be in this place life, has abandoned you
WORLD that we now live in has changed so rapidly
THERE'S no need for equality equality
All the dreams, ideals you fought for, waiting now for someone else
It's not real, that you're feeling parts of life's exterior
I can see you body rot, gaze upon your cornea
No one wins we end together, values, visions dead forever
HATE to be nothing why do you abandon me
WORDS without actions lies they mean nothing
CAN'T you all see the light that waves in front of you
THIS could be a mirror of the only ever way that WE'VE KNOWN
I can take what they've taught and make it work
THIS would be a better place if you could free you mind of thought
THOUGH to be in this place life, has abandoned you
WORLD that we now live in has changed so rapidly
THERE'S no need for equality equality

Black haired witches
Bitches with their goats
Black robes and candles
Rituals can begin!
City of lust
Incest and brutality
City of sin
Pleasures so sweet
City of hell
Born to deviation
City of Sodom
I await my death!
Pagan gods dwell
Within the city walls
Satanic dominion
Darkness prevails
Naked bodies fuck
Fornicate on christian altar
Living in eternal lust
Sodomites and blasphemers
Sinning sex, bestial rape!
Sadomatic rites,
Agony and pain, paradise lost,
Sadomatic rites,

I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
War is in my heart, death is by my side
[Chorus]
War heart! With no remains of compassion or love
War heart! Hate your fellow as yourself
I have chosen night to be my guide
When the daylight strikes, I hide in my trench and die
[Chorus]

Il y a longtemps
Bien avant qu'elle ne nous ait quittes
Une nouvelle ere, est apparue
Qui a tout deblance
La deesse, la verite
A jamais oublie
Nous pouvons pas exister
En restant separe
Forgotten Goddess
Forgotten Goddess
One can't live without the other
Each half makes a whole
Replace what is missing in your life
Complete your soul
Il y a longtemps

Farewell my brother
Farewell my foe
May death embrace you
Your blood in the darkness flow
You were never meant to rule
Never to light up my father's throne
May you suffer deep below
You tried to deprive (me of) my rightful crown
Fallen, defeated, tricked by Beorc,
The Lunar Force
Behold the sorcerer when you're
Impaled by the sword
Farewell my brother
Farewell my friend
May she have pity with you
We did not wish for your life to end

Rotting meat-a tasty midnight snack
Freshly decomposed
Slurping the slop that's still in the ass
Proceeding to siphon the carnage
A hose in my mouth now becomes a pump
To thrust the liquefied carrion into my orifice
A most unhealthiest of dumps
A flatulating-felch-fuck, I sat on the stump
Expleing heinous gasses and bio-hazards
Ingesting my own defecation
Increased inhuman carnal desire
Fecophelia-due to exposure to methane
Heaping mounds of human waste
Humid is the stench
Feces, organs, blood, and sinew
Sex through death
Diseased, enlarged by hypothalamus
Pleasure and pain
Carnally decimated-exposure to methane
Thick and sickening is the stench of humanity
Laid to waste
Ripped strips from my face
I gag on the taste
To know life, fuck death in the gallbladder
To know life, fuck death and disease
To know life
Fuck death

Run
Every second is a pure affliction
But I can feel your pain
Choke back the burn of wrath as they violate your name
No sign of innocence in this godforsaken place
When the truth is in your hands, they'll spit upon your face
Dismantle the ground they stand on
Give power a name
You've traveled the path of slander
Now bury the shame
Shed rejection
Learn to follow the wolves
[Chorus]
Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries, to the shelter of release
Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries, to immunity
See the struggle of the faithless lot as they negate their time
How low to sink to the depths of their frame of mind
Dismantle the ground they stand on
Give power a name
You've traveled the path of slander
Now bury the shame
Shed rejection
Learn to follow the wolves
[Chorus]
No tear for desolation
Nearing the end of our misery
[Chorus]

Closing doorways as your building a fire,
Watching lies received as you silently conspire
"This is a heart attack and I want my life back"
We can take this if we fake this if we try
Oh, everybody wants you and you know that they wont be alive to take you home
"They found me now and I dont think you understand that I was lost I was lost and I had no place to go but I dont think youd understand"
Taking chances or just breathing in vain
The four lives lost at cost were twenty times less worth your name
This is a heart attack and you want your life back
"I can take this if I fake this if they die"
And you want what you cant change, but your selfish pride will take the lives of others you could save.(You knew where the fire started, your instinct was inside knowledge) And before you make this right; youve come this far without a scar, your saving us tonight.

( Martti perkele, Saatanan Martti..! )
Lords of chaos, rulers of death
In your hands waits the last breathe
Dominator of the numbers
Show the way, secrets of six
Power of dark will rise above tonight
Living a soulless life
Rain of blood wash us away
Statues of life will never see the day
Mistress of the night seduces the light
Innocent smile provocate to endless suicide
Power of dark will rise above tonight
Final global war turn hell into sky
Northern secrets on my side
Living a soulless life

The icy winter is getting near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost is in the air
Darkness surrounds us
The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the long ships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
Many years we have been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home
The many hardships we've endured
That brought us rich rewards
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold
Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly trade them place
In Odens hall up high
The icy winter is getting near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost is in the air
Darkness surrounds us
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its trail
And we will hope for the summer breeze
When we can set our sails

Where ere thou hast been
Here or in yon world manifest?
Canst thou tell what is
Or what was or what is to come?
Nothing shall last
And there are things
That shall never change
History is written in blood
Yet are battles really lost
On the battlefields?
Canst thou tell me whence thou comest
And where thou goest?
And what is or what was
Or what is to come?
For everything remains as it never was

We wrote these plans
Took the order the architecture
And followed them to the end
Until the gears ground cold and relentless
There was no remorse
We had none
We kept on
With no trace of a regret
I never saw any blood
No soul for the body
Watch them turn her scab covered skin into stone
Like a coal in the sky
Searching for the dawn for the last time
Bloated with white eyes wide
We've come to an understanding
You lose, I profit
High noon and there ain't
No secrets, no more excuses
Now our number's up
Let them lead us by the throat
Now just smile
While the rope pulls tighter
Guilty is an understatement
The hourglass is never right side up
And all the time
We try to tear the script up
Forgetting all the sour for the sweet
The paragraph has never been so empty
The mother dies with infant in arms
The lifeless test tube,
Look what she's done
Evolution gave us a clock
That's always winding down

And obedient to Commands
Thine eyes impose on me
Caressed by thine scathing hands
I fall, one more, for thee
In storm and in darkness
I found delight... sentenced
Slave Forever
Entralled by the dew of blood
That comes out with every lash
Slave Forever
I drown in this torture flood
In this secret stash
I vanish, out of sight,
Into nothingness...
I shall be thy slave forever

That's why I find it so amusing
That the Latter-day Saints of our business
One, attribute to me motives that just weren't there
And two accuse me of corrupting morality
Which I wish I had the power to do, prepare to die
An encloaking, dark epoch
In which all life is now appraised
Another valueless commodity
On which the paracious may feebly graze
Indebted homage to their mammon
Whilst the mort is the music of the meek
Transcendence from a beatifully brutal reality
Is what I seek
Noxious, sully dolour
Is not the sentiment upon which we feed
But precocious consciousness
Draws out a morbid nous to bleed
Chiselling out seething words
Which cut deep down to the bone
Always legible
So be it on our own headstone
Rising to out own nadir
Reality we try to extirpate
Trying to raise a twisted smile
Similar to that silver plate
On a coffin which is joined
Hammering in each final nail
Last kill and testament
Left now intestate
Noxious, sully dolour
Is not the thesis which is bled
A precarious train of thought
In which mental cattle-trucks are led
Carving out skilful words
Which shear brittle bones
Always spelt out well
We just can't leave the dead alone
Monographic text
A terminal doctrine of diseased minds perplexed
Enunciated epigrams
Eschatological, rotten requiems
Always our own worst cynics
Exorcisers of scorching scorn
Digging our own graves
But never stand over and mourn
The roulade now pandemonium
Displaced in the muggy sods
Espoused with the macabre
The dead we filch and rob
Munificant bale
From the deviants staid
Execrations, taunting spiritual release
Exoneration, upon the perishable we feast
Excogitation, picking at the bones of convention
Exculpitation, foul verbal conflagration
Epigraphic text, a literary vex
The macabre perplexed, with corporeality meshed
Euthenic text
An unpleasant journey to a world perplexed
Corporeal epigraphs
Eschatological unpleasantness
Always forever cryptic
Exercisers of twisted grief
Helping you to dig up the interred
Whilst fresh still are the wreaths
The harmony now pandemonium
Heard out in the muddy dirt
Espoused with the bizzare
We play on our own turf
Epithetic text
A macabre rality perplexed
Execrations, literary tales of atrocities fairy
Exoneration, harsh, cold bloody marys
Excogitation, a narcissistic eutechnique
Exculpitation, perverse artworks, so unique
Monographic text, a literary vex
The macabre perplexed with reality meshed

I have traveled
So far to find
So little, meaning
In tragedy,or tragedy
In, the search for, meaning
Dark clouds have lead me here
Confined, freedom
Guides us to, security
What if everything
I have been taught is a lie
And all of my, teachers
Have been wrong this whole time
Compelling us
To fight the battles
They would not
They have, already won
And we have, already lost
If we do not learn to change
We have, already lost
We have, already lost
If we do not learn to change

Constructed with vengeful hate
The extinction of life, man's final plight
We strive until the end
Though none shall be taken alive
A killing machine, programmed for death
To destroy all that comes within his sight
Mindless, created insane
Mankind shall never survive, never survive
Strength becoming weaker
As fear grows within
Faced with eternal damnation
The end shall now begin
Profane creation
The dawn of a new age
Technology's progression
Over man machines reign
Enslaved without compassion
New masters of the earth we dwell
Human life is worthless
In this automated living hell
In the quest for perfection, life becomes obsolete
Humanity faces deletion, this nightmare world is complete
As we wait for execution, in silence we stand in line
The total extinction of the existence of mankind
Our futile life's now ended
Free from the suffering and pain
Our systems now are loaded
We have been created profane
Profane creation
The dawn of a new age
Technology's progression
Over man machines reign
Enslaved without compassion
New masters of the earth we dwell
Human life is worthless
In this automated living hell
In the quest for perfection, life becomes obsolete
Humanity faces deletion, this nightmare world is complete
As we wait for execution, silent we stand in line
The total extinction of the existence of mankind

It all started when the frost took the lakes
it all ended at the same time
it all lasted for a second or two
it all lasted for eternity...
I saw all the source of life fading away
the sun will forget to rise tomorrow.
Spending the rest of my time strolling in woods
I saw the moon crying again...
It all gave rise to wintry snowstorm
it all stopped the wind, the silence came in
it all blinded us, it all took the sight
it all was the vision of the last winter...
I saw all the source of life fading away
the sun will forget to rise tomorrow.
Spending the rest of my time strolling in woods
I saw the moon crying again...

Everyone knows me
Everyone loves me
Everyone dreads me
Everyone respects me
Soulless, maybe a wizard
Free from... I'm just another god
Everyone knows him
Close at hand shades... a real presence
So far at the stars, behind this closed door
A sensation! The presence which gets away
Soulless, maybe crazy
Free from... I'm just another... god !
I don't have my own existence
But alone I respond to more than a thousand names
I've never appeared physically
But they've portrayed me under multiple appearances
Nestled in your unconscious
I'm born with the night, your night
From your obscurest thoughts
I stand out... master or fiend
I'm born with the night
I stand out mirror of your nightmares
I'm born with your night
Ecstasy's angel, the Reign of Terror
I can exhaust my soul
I can deride your pride
I'm free from all beliefs
I'm just another god
Everyone knows him
Everyone loves him
Everyone dreads him
Everyone respects him
Soulless, maybe crazy
Free from, I'm just another god!

Somebody
Somebody Put Something In My Drink
Somebody
Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat
Oh, bartender, please
Vodka and Tonic's my favorite drink
I don't like anything colored pink
That just stinks...it's not for me
It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something
Blurred vision and dirty thoughts
Feel (out of place), very distraught
Feel something coming on
Kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more
I can't think
Hey! What's in this drink?
It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something, in my drink in my drink, in my drink, in my
Drink
So you think it's funny
A college prank
Goin' insane for something to drink
Feel a little dry
Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
Cause somebody put something in my drink
I can't think
Hey! Give me a drink
It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink

On the first floor of the dryout house
Was a replica dartboard
And the man on the floor
Sorta went out of window, over the lawn
And round to the mad kid
"Please take this medallion,
Please wear this medallion.
It's no sign of authority.
Wear the gold and put it on"
Courtesy winter
(Winter)
So [around the] mad kid
Man on the first floor said
"I just looked round
I just looked round
I just looked round
"And my youth it was sold"
Two white words frost the sky
There fly krakens
And sometimes, that little.....
Makes me tremble
Courtesy winter
The mad kid had 4 lights, the average is 2.5 lights
The mediocre has 2 lights, the sign of genius is three lights
There's one light left, that's the one light
That's the science law
Courtesy winter

I know you wanna make up for last time
I'll let you know when it's alright
I know you feel like you've fallen behind
But you've been right by my side
(Oh) I bet you think you're doin' a favor
(Oh) I bet you think that you're my lifesaver
I just want to let you know
I'm glad to finally see you go
This is how you know
When you're feelin' out of place
When your palms are sweaty
And don't know what to say
Think that they're all judging
But feel the same way
They just want to be free
So open up their cage
And do 'em a favor
(Yeah aye oh tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
You can thank me later
(Ohhh oh aye aye tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
(Oh) I bet you think you're doin' a favor
(Oh) I bet you think that you're my lifesaver
I just want to let you know
I'm glad to finally see you go
I know you think you're doin' me a favor
Glad to finally see you go
You think you're doin' me a favor
Everyone's glad to see you go
(Oh) I bet you think you're doin' a favor
(Oh) I bet you think that you're my lifesaver
I just want to let you know
I'm glad to finally see you go

I raise my sword to dance
and make disease like a caim
I travel with ancient gods
only silence above the stars.
Many years and patience past
hundred battles which shadows cast
the darkest one I have been
and like timeless I stand.
Vain hiljaisuus ylla yollisen taivaan saa,
syyshamaran varjojen alta
heidan verensa virtaamaan
ja katso, me naemme sen tulevan
ylla tuulten ja metsien
alla tulisen taivaan kuolemaa tuottaen.
Now it's silence in the sky
no more words, no more cries
dust descends to the ground
final sleep they were found

[Music & Lyrics: Sammet]
Here alone now I'm staring at the sea
Behind the far horizon
Is there a better place for me?
Afraid to drown, afraid to dive
Scared by fears and the hot sunlight, yeah
And I dance in the rain, dive in the pool of life
Wash away the poison
And I dance through this pain, my body in a starless night
To wash away the poison from my soul, turn it to gold
Between the devil and the deep sea
I don't know how to carry on
I only feel that inner force that's pushing me along
The tides of life bring clarity for my tumbling mind
I'll dive to see, set me free
[repeat chorus]
[solo: Both]
[repeat chorus]

Here we go
Right to the sky
And breaking the silent
To a place
Where I know that we'll live
Without pain and without lies
Without sorrow and without cries
Cause I saw
More people dying that you can imagine
My dream world
Is a long way from here
Through the mountains, through the earth
Through the oceans, through your heart
So many years
Trying to break free
Trying to understand, why?
Fight
Long way from here
Do it without fear
Trying to understand, why?
Fight!
[Solo: Rionda]
Still we go
Right to the sky
And breaking the silent
Take your love
And come with me
To the place where I've been waiting
For the day I'll take your hand
Cause I saw
More people dying that you can imagine
My dream world
Is a long way from here
Through the mountains, through the earth
Through the oceans, through your heart
So many years
Trying to break free
Trying to understand, why?
Fight
Long way from here
Do it without fear
Trying to understand, why?
Fight!

Caught in a Woodsleep
Miles Down the Crypts Beneath
Desert Sands lay Deep
Sworn to an Obscure Belief
Shapes with Serpent Faces
Watchers in Deathwish Cry
Warpzones in Mazes
Venomous Tounges in Sigh
Upon the Salty Wall of the Broody Gargoyle
Broody - Come Forward from the Salt in your Wall
Broody - A Weak Human Soul is your Call

Rising from mundane existence
A new world seen through your eyes
To deception give no resistance
Your hopes and dreams are now sanctified
Blind to the hypocrisy
Goodness is all that you see
And your past life is cast aside
In false truths you now confide
Pledged to a life of divinity
Superior through your own piety
Holier than thou
Alone you wear the crown
In your private [Incomprehensible]
Look to what you have become
Condemned to misery and strife
Alone you wear the crown of life
The crown of life
The crown of life

Sitting under a pine
The deep silence... unbroken around
One dark lake
So placid, so cold...
Descended night
Throws shadows over water
Brown leaves fly
Autumn is turning into winter
What happens around me?
It has no meaning...
I sleep in my woe
This is not my world...
For my world lies
Beyond other's reach
Shadows dancing - my throne
My dreams' winterland I behold
Through the gates of time unseen
In a silent night
Somewhere deep inside
In the darkest woods
In the darkest nights
Lies my ancient realm
Where are still places
For me to find
Shadows dancing - my throne
My dreams' winterland I behold
Through the gates of time unseen
In a silent night

Confidence and hope
I'm looking forward to future plans
Not able to realize yet
Makes me wanna take a rope
or swallow some pills any time
But let's have a look
In the distance I see light
Gives me satisfaction
Keeps me hangin' on
When stability is gone
I take my own life
I make the decisions
I have a goal
That's worth living
Confidence in what I do
realising my hope
That's the bright side I'm looking for
But I know how to take it
In times when my life looks shattered
and I'm not feeling to well
Confused when I think
Which direction not for sure
Dreams far away
Time doesn't seem to go on

Yet my monologue's unheard

Glowing and blazing
In the wind of times
Ever lit
Searching and fathoming
The fire's arcane
Consuming flames
Sparks to imbue
Our very souls
Pervading

Burning so bright
Yet clandestine
Gleaming in the lair
Of the powers that be
The four mighty ones
The high kings concealed

Flickering from the depths

Another sunrise swathes the earth in light.
The sun, a symbol of innocence, inverse of the night.
Yet with all this energy comes a certain weakness.
'O hear it's silent cries as the blackness envelops.
Amass, congregate. Form an ashen shroud, asphyxiate.
Secure restraint reigns, mummify the sun.
Drag it down to earth with it's age old flame extinguished.
The event of it's demise, an invitation to it's rival.
Lord of insanity, replacing joy with madness.
Now all life on earth, turns it's head towards it's master.
Rationality, replaced with numbed mesmerisation.

I'm a man with two good hands, two good hands and a plot of land
And I'm on a mission, I've got a vision and a planning permission
I've got twenty-thousand bricks to lay
Honey I don't have a place to stay
I've just got this canvas tent and a machine to
Mix the cement
You think I've lost the plot
I have not!
I've sheltered you from the rain
You and I will defy the elements again!
I need a home in which to revel
I need a place to keep my spirit level
And I know the right guys
Cause I used to work in building supplies
Cramped in a humble abode
Concrete and steel by the wheelbarrow load
Fittings to choose, colour charts to peruse
I've got a trowel and I ain't afraid to use it!
You think I've lost the plot
I have not!
I've sheltered you from the rain
You and I will defy the elements again!

Your life means nothing.
Parting isn't such sweet sorrow.
Dripping with hate.
Words from the inner soul.
Realization of my ways.
Evidently unapparant.
Ignominous behaviour.
Physically repulsed by you.
Tormentation of emotion.
Occupy my every thought.
Freezing you, my infliction.
So cold that you will burn.
Excruciating pain you learn.
Mutual hate - on this vastitude of fate.
Only one stands to win.
Let the murdering begin.
Now you suffer.
Amongst all ye children now.
Cowards die often.
I will not let things lie.
Demise architecht.
This grudge will infect.

there were words of lust
in these arms of the stranger
and there in silence though were words of no milder
so in thinking of that madness
that ravage the thoughts
in the loneliest of hours
I resist without control
the demand I get from excellence
the void I felt from answering
not only an addition
it generated need
in these endless nights of freezing
my weight on the other side
I resist without control
feel the thorns of uncontrol
claws that set in sleeps december
let loose on the verge
talked to me as strangers once did
the tone was set for winter
sweet uncontrol
beyond proportion
into the night
so strike me deeper
I resist without control
feel the thorns of uncontrol
the death that craved no life
now ended
in return
drifting uncontrolably
within the night

A nexus fruition, whirling cognition
Ulterior, the failing of words
A pageant to leave me bewildered
Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy
Pervading anima
An awe-struck principle, an adytum to find our home
Long for the rapture again
Crave for the pristine light
Vastness engulfing the soul
Unfurling this truth, an orbit in sovereignty
Sown into deep darkness
The grain has to die, perish to bestow new life
A vis major painting a rapturous view
Heralding a vivid thema
Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like bearing in pain
Like embracing life an decaying in death
Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like the caress of a mother
Like life to go withered, a perennial pneuma
I will not forget what I arose from
Decidual the forests proclaim
The glory primal, the rapturous supremacy
Vanquishing the vile
Burgeoning beyond, bearing the essence of life
Crave for the rapture again
Long for the pristine light

Slowly turns the key of time
In the lock of promises broken
In mute silence of my space
I crouch under my yearning
Under my yearning
The works of my gods receding now
Evade my grasping hands
Her hair I would long to adorn
With glowing stars
Her brow with shining sun
In silver I would trace
The moonshine of her grace
The shining one
Perfection of the skies
I knew and memories of my days
Fade away beyond my reach
And change to lonely nights

{You break my heart into a thousand pieces
And you say it's because I deserve better?}
{You break my heart
You break my heart
You break my heart}
{You break my heart into a thousand pieces
And you say it's because I deserve better?}
Emotionless gray skies
Bleed somber dreams of sorrow
Blackened unseen heart
Tears, a virgin's godlike innocence
From its pristine palace
Paint sarcastic smiles upon new wounds
Tears of misery, stain scar filled minds
Hatred new like tomorrow flows from bitter memories
Purity now embraced by sinful ideals, why?
Lifeless tomb rests weary with prowling peering eyes
Silence falls upon deaf ears covered by night
Alone in thought, shaking
Biting tongues of lead at unfit moments
Screaming disbelief with no faith in site
Yeah, her disgust has borders
Limits to strive for
She bends and breaks
To the rules set by the weak
She's finally seen, she's a beautiful girl
With a smile so grand she could stop the world
Stolen her skin, he sews her mouth shut
Means nothing to him, her screams just die out
As she cries out
Her voice dies out
As she cries out
Her voice dies out
Love once inside her heart, lay in my hands
Love once inside her heart, lay in my hands
Love once inside her heart, lay in my hands
So beautiful
She cries
So beautiful
Was it asked for?
Was it implied?
What could have been done?
Was it asked for?
Was it implied?
What could have been done?
Inside her mind dies

I exist in a constant dreamstate
Where my mind is free to wander
The answers come so easily
To all the of the questions pondered
I'm not held down by this body
I'm not tethered to this Earth
The spirit realm is my playground
Master of the universe
We're out of body and out of our minds
Shit out of luck and out of time
Every day in this world seems exactly the same
Nothing learned or achieved, just the same old routine
I take a breath, set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely, may the Great Spirits guide it
I take a breath, set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely, may the Great Spirits guide it
All this noise and everything you say
Does not concern me, I'm miles away
Not searching for anything in particular
Just thumbing through the Akashic Records
Access to all knowledge as needed
All that was and all that will be
Seeing past the illusion of time
The potential of what we all could be
I take a breath, set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely, may the Great Spirits guide it

The high office of the President has been used
To foment a plot to destroy the President John Fitzgerald Kennedy
In a speech made to Columbia University on Nov. 12, 1963
Ten days before his assassination
Americans' freedom and before I leave office
I must inform the citizen of this plight

On a course to fight
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
To the heavens we take
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists
The thrill of the kill in the hunters chase
We have exposed the night, from which the feeble flee
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Brandish new force, like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
Subservient dogs
Crippled by the pack
Crawling in blind honour
Head down to be shot
Feel the new force, like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
You crawled in the dark
Blind faith broke you down
Face down in submission
Laying down to be shot
This dawn is ours to rise
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
Destruction, force to strike
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Clenched fists rise!
From the dawn has arisen the hunter
The banishing force, the new world dominator!

Reach through my window and pull the shades
No shine, no sunlight, just cold and grey
There's no way to rise from beneath your wings
Chained to your side, I can never leave
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
(Shadow maker)
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
(Shadow maker)
Over my head, over my head
Everything is so empty, no glass half full
How can someone so beautiful be so miserable?
I'd follow you down to the edges of earth
Just to hear you say that your life is cursed
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
(Shadow maker)
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
(Shadow maker)
Over my head, over my head
You won't let me leave, I don't wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like I'm dying inside
But you don't care, we carry on
You won't let me leave, I don't wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like I'm dying inside
You don't care, we carry on
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
(Shadow maker)
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
(Shadow maker)
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
(Shadow maker)
Over my head, over my head
Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up

Frozen streams and vapours gray,
cold and waste the landscape lay...
Then a hale of wind.
Hither-Whirling, Thither-Swilrling,
Spinn the fog and spinn the mist...
Still we walked on through woods and wintry gray,
home through woods where winter lay - Cold and dark...
(Waiting for a change in the weather.
Waiting for a shift in the air.
Could we get there together, ever?
Waiting for our late, late return)
Through the woods. Home through the woods where winter lay...

Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson 1994
He wandered on fine old paths
He wandered alone high ridges
He wandered towards the heart of
Midgard
He wandered until he saw a mountain
Over a bridge wet with drew he walked
Through the golden gate of Asgard
He saw the vigorous gardens of gods
crowned around the Father of All's High
Castle
"O'Father of All, I Ganglere ask:
How have we all come to existence and
where do we end?
Answer, O'High, even High and Third
what
is mankind and the Race of Gods faith?"
Gylfaginning, deception for he who was
wrongly taught, but
not for the one who knows
Gylfaginning, Grimnes' revelation.
Music: Ivar Bjrnson 1994

Oozing chyme reeks as your duodenum is hacked
Secreting gastric juices, enzymes melt your fecal tract
Torn major arteries, your corpse with blood is drenched
Your mouth is ripped inside out as your esophagus is wrenched
Maggots and grubs bore into the moldy remains
Masticating lymph, caked blood and cankered decay
Maturating brains play host to the grisly feet
Stuffed anal passage, served on a plate
Purulent torso is a perfect maggots meal
Split cerebrospinal fluid is sucked up with zeal
Botulism vitiates the emulsifying bile
Liquidized gall bladder, viscid pus smells vile

Dormancy
Spirits await rebirth
From their sleep
They will soon awake
Restless dead
Catching the wiff of hate
Blood they anticipate
They will soon drink
Murderers
Subconscious attraction
On their graves
Blood will now spill
Ancient bones
Reform in grounds below
Born, as the blood will flow
Killing is all they know
Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood
Coalesce
Pieces become a whole
For their strength
Blood is absorbed
Rancorous
Aeons of building rage
Death an immortal cage
Now they are freed
Livid beasts
Rising now for revenge
From the past
Hate comes alive
Tenebrous
Restruct evil ones
The demons will come
Cruelity has just begun
Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood
First one that they find
Attack the mortal
Claws tear at his face
Pull the flesh from bone
Decapitate the man
They hold his head aloft
Headless body slumps
The blood is gushing out
Screaming victims fall
Repulsive beasts attack
Gore pours from the torso
Hellish creatures stab
Organs, grisly trophies
Rewards for their rage
Blood drips from their jaws
They disembowel the corpse
Kill with speed
Victims bleed
Wretched souls
Headless on poles
Savage thirst
Vesseles burst
Torn apart
Eat the heart
Vengeance taking form
Endless hatred for the living
Plunderng the world
Paroxysm of the damned
Rapture of their rage
Euphoria from butchery
A dark world will eclipse all life
Barbaric ways forever reign
[solos- Owen, O'Brien, Owen, O'Brien]
Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood

always is the time to eat
watch yourself growing out of your seat
watch the cherish of parental love
flow all down the drain
you used to be family's pride
but the way you grew cast you aside
pretty, quiet, slim and slender
turned a lump of unknown gender
dead-ringing a montain of flesh
a monster of omnivorouss excess
too vast to be of human race
- monster
fat and ugly must not be loved
that's why dad is never home
that's why mummy turns away
they hate your ugly face
eat and vomit, starve and die
they won't bother to ask you why
they won't see you fade away
this is the price the ugly must pay
dead-ringing a montain of flesh
a monster of omnivorouss excess
too vast to be of human race
- monster
a monster of flabby flesh
pathic revolting excess
can't believe this a human face
- monster

So close... the water
so cold... the fire
so sleep away, the coma be your home
corrode and smile you're not alone
So deep... the water
so free... the fire
so go away, the radio calls your name
{I think} you know, their names were all the same

She's riding on a crimson wave
Truth sat on her shoulder
Planets before melting face
The keys for the wounded
Sinking into underground
Please the one who wants it
Something is pulling you down
It's not the cravings why you need it
It's a rush hour inside my head
Don't wanna share the anguish
And I will take it away from you
Before you can change it
That bastard hallucination's pushing me
Like a damned I walk over
Touch the sky when it's burning red
Standing the ground I have chosen
Standing the ground I have chosen
Shivering in outer space
There's no one who can hear you
Getting into different state
It's like getting nowhere
Gathering all those fears and fails
There's no one who can see you
Someone is pulling you down
It's not the cravings why you need it
It's a rush hour inside my head
Don't wanna share the anguish
And I will take it away from you
Before you can change it
That bastard hallucination's pushing me
Like a damned I walk over
Touch the sky when it's burning red
Standing the ground I have chosen
Standing the ground I have chosen
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

Driven now by fetid winds, we came to this place of despair
Fresh visions of death filled my mind with disgust
Yet still we stood here and stared
A world steeped in torment
Where agony prevails
With cruel sadistic torture
All hope of life now fades
The time has come, you have no choice, now you face your death
Choke at your last breath
Your mind now screams
Could it be you're insane
To live your life
Within the lost souls domain
Lost souls domain
Plead for mercy
To your gods now pray
For in this place
You now shall stay
No way out
Tripped within
This reign of terror
Shall now begin
Shall now begin
City of the damned - hear the screams cry out
The agony within - untold without a doubt
Feel your life - slipping through your hands
A new reality - held now by this land

Embers burn and light the way to take the steps of those before you
Fearing life and taking what was never yours is far from graceful
Now you'll suffer, I'll burn all the memories that you've held on to
Wanting, waiting, wasting all your life with such anticipation
Blowing out the flames of life it's time
Burning all your flesh I watch the flames turn white
Didn't even ever think to ask you why
Will this stop the lies?
Thinking that your life had meaning
That it was someting great
Why don't I choose to believe
You will never convince me
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Always wanting never learning and you never made the time
Till your life's sudden ending came and now you live to die
Trapped in what you thought "it could never ever be worse"
Than the life full of misery that you had upon this earth
Searching for the ultimate escape you think you've found
Now you're just a rotting corpse as you lie there in the ground
This is all is and now you've only had to die
This all there is and now there's nothing
You're... The only one
You... The only one
When you're safe we'll hunt you down, Ruin you
All the things that I've never wanted or had to
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Learning nothing, doing nothing
Feeling nothing, what's the point?
All this time that I've stood by you
You're a shell all dead inside
This is all you'll get from me
This is all I have for you
Why must I continue to...
You are now NOTHING
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Always wanting never learning you never made the time
Till your life's sudden ending came and now you live to die
Trapped in what you thought "it could never ever be worse"
Than the life full of misery that you had upon this earth
Searcing for the ultimate escape you think you've found
Now you're just a rotting corpse as you lie there in the ground
This is all is and now you've only had die
This is all there is and now there's nothing
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Will this stop the lies?

Born to bow to the altar of the lord
Learn and pray
Watching you from above to dominate
Manipulate with this book
Caress an abstraction
It's only in your mind
Useless denial of reality
Diabolic existence
The root of evil is you
Centuries of inquisition
to burn your own mistake
Your eyes are the eyes of malevolence
Your horns are your faith and your cruelty
Your thoughts are corrupted with deceit
Honesty was burned at the stake
Agonize, brutalize crawl in disgust
the end of the truth is the beginning of your fate
The horns and the eyes of malice
Deceit is the name of the game

I've scaled over the walls of morality
Not quite sure what I'd find
There on the other side
Waiting in a common stance
Relieve me of my duty
As keeper of this body
Just leave me with my mind
And I assure you
I will be just fine
Tears stream from cheek
Of a man whose body his mind does not seek
A very gruelling rendition
Of a human soul's indecision
The qualities of a finer being
Locked well within this shell
Crying out to be released
To a body that serves as well
Malformed at birth
You see what it's worth
In a mirror I ask why
Such a shame, wanting to die
In a past lifetime
I feel I've had mine
Shared with no one
Excuse me I must go now !
Unhappy as he exits
Unhappy as he came
Enthralled in the Essence
The Essence of life to be

And I can make you happy too.
Her lips like venom, her eyes so deadly.
Beneath a fire that burns blue, a heart untouched, a heart abused.
You hurt like a blade, though my wounds shall heal.
But my wrath burns strong as I think of you.
Turn and die or repent.

If you still need to double check my work to make sure
You agree. If you need to sign an "X" before and after
Every title before it's relevant, then I've wasted six
Years of my life on the simple notion that this was an
Open forum. Then I've wasted six years. Burn them, if
Your edge is so sharp it severs ties. Burn them, if
You've never been proud. Burn them all. Burn them, if
You've never been ashamed. Burn them. Burn them. Burn
Them and be done with it. Burn them, if the music only
Plays second stage. Burn them, if you've never been
Scared. Burn them, if your edge is so sharp, it severs
Ties. Burn them, if you've never been proud. Burn
Them. Burn them. Burn them and be done with it. Burn
Them. Burn them. Burn them and be done with it. And
None of us have all the answers, that's the whole
Point. Just the opinions that serve and piss off the
Masses whether left, right, or right at home.

At first light
Deep within entrenchments
The orders are revealed
A final push impending
Encoded messages have been received
At first light
Fires of the enemy dead will burn bright
If in mourning they choose we die
Zero hour at first light
The waiting time is over
No final night before
Once more into action
Embrace the storm. Oncoming for all
Standing
At the edge
Allegiances
Now pledged... forever
Orders - unquestionable
All rank and file expendable
The frozen dawn emerges
Let the battle now commence
None surrendered through last night
Zero hour approaching
At first light
Fires of the enemy dead will burn bright
If in mourning they choose we die
Zero hour approaching

Chaos uprising
Unleashing hell
Human waste
The will of the few
Will dominate the many
Human flesh
Scattered remains
From the sky above
A lethal force of mass destruction
Is casted upon the flesh
That lie below
Devastation unleashed
Fuel to the internal fire
A will of stronghold
And unquestionable belief
Life means nothing
Only the religious belief
Into oblivion
With the deceased
Another martyr screams
Faith in the unseen
Dying for their moral stupidity
The gods are preparing a human feast
The end complete
Peace retrieved
Law forces upon the free
Extreme measure
For the extreme at heart
The flesh always summons pain
From the sky above
A lethal force of mass destruction
Is casted upon the flesh
Unleashing hell below

Glory Surrounds you, high King of heaven
None can compare to you
Words could not tell of your wonder, oh King of Kings
you deserve it all
Salvation flows from you, Son of the Highest
Your name brings death to life
Light of the world you stepped down from your throne
All to call and lead me home
And oh how, I long to know you deeper
My heart it yearns to feel you
More than these words could say
Let me breath declare
Jesus Is, Jesus Is
Oh, Glory Surrounds you, high King of heaven
None can compare to you
Oh, words could not tell of your wonder, oh King of Kings
you deserve it all
And oh how, I long to know you deeper
My heart it yearns to feel you
More than these words could say
Let me breath declare
And oh how, I long to know you deeper
My heart it yearns to feel you
More than these words could say
Let me breath declare
Jesus Is
Your Kingdom come, Your Will be done
Here on earth, here on earth
Your Kingdom come, Your Will be done
Here on earth, here on earth
Your Kingdom come, Your Will be done
Here on earth, here on earth
Your Kingdom come, Your Will be done
Here on earth, here on earth
Your Kingdom come, Your Will be done
Here on earth, here on earth
And oh how, I long to know you deeper
My heart it yearns to feel you
More than these words could say
Let me breath declare
Jesus Is, Jesus Is

This is your time
Your life's flashing before your eyes
And soon enough you will realize
This is goodbye
But what if I gave you a chance
You just have to sell your soul
Look around, what do you see
The choices you never had the guts to make
I'm sorry you never could be the man that you wanted
But regret is wasted on me
I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you
This feeling's amazing, I know
But be careful, you know not what you wish for
Granted life but now you've cheated death
There's no where to run when you run from yourself
But fear not for as long as you live
You are mine
And even in death you will find
You've lived with regret for so long but now
Is your chance to change what has been wrong
I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you
And I know that my destiny wasn't written in the stars
It was just a part of satellites
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you
Don't ever trust the devil, bitch!
I never wanted this
It's time that you suffered the consequence
I should have know my time was up
I crave you your time, and now your soul is mine
I can't feel air inside my lungs
I'm dead
All because of...
YOU!
All because of you!
I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead!
All because of you!
I can't rebuild my life and start again
All because of you!
All because of you!
All because of...

Burning in its savage fury
Our fates accept not judge or jury
Helpless we must watch it done
For I have seen the Death of the Sun
We are coming to the end
I see my life and I have sinned
It's too late to change our ways
For man has seen his final days
Solar winds that parch the land
Minions are wasted by Satan's hand
A molten globe will torch the sky
As mankind bleats his final cry!

Stiff as hell, fade to black, blackness swells
Forgetting never felt so good, yeah
Remembering only as a reference
Today is gauzed by how unhappy I am not
I can still hear what's going on back there and I don't care
One would struggle to find some kind of peace of mind but I just don't care
Once would struggle to find some kind of peace of mind
Even when this dance is over, I won't stop moving
I will never miss a beat, I would not be able to move like this
Without having walked through your door, I would not, no
Not without having my eyes shut or having watched them burn
Shaped, redirected, reevaluated, created a new man
Thanks for getting me in, I'll get you next time
Much like discipline is the price to pay for progression
The admission price for happiness is often suffering
Regret loses it's luster and appeal after considering that where we are
On our lives is merely the product of experiences and decisions

I've had one desire since I was born
To see my body ripped and torn
To see my flesh devoured before my eyes
I'm here for you I volunteer as a human sacrifice
[Chorus]
Carve me up, slice me apart
Suck my guts, lick my heart
Chop me up I like to be hurt
Drink my marrow and blood for dessert
Eaten, my one desire, my only wish is to be
Eaten, the longer I live the more I'm dying to feel the pain
Eaten, I would do anything to be
Eaten, my one desire, my only wish is to be
Eaten,
I finally found you, my personal slaughter
As an appetizer, I let you taste my daughter
Call me sick but this is what I need
My only purpose here is for you to feed
Desecrate me
Tear me limb from limb
Eviscerate me
Chew me to death

Driving down the freeway
About to smoke
A tulip of fresh pseudo nugs
Reaching for the lighter
My taste buds are enticed
I'm feeling high
Listening to Fleshgrind
Watching the idiot in front of me
Veer to the left, accelerate
Speed traps radars me
Police lights flash
Oh shit, they are pulling me over
Runs to the car, smells the reefer
Pull me out throws me to the ground
In his panic, feeds me to his dog
Road is hot burning flesh
While back-ups destroy the car
All for a little bid of weed
Dog bite my arm
Treat me as a murderer
Please let me up
The handcuffs are too tight
I'm begging you please this is not right
These hicks fucking laugh at me
You bled to much
You're under arrest
For what your done with no contest
Cannibal cop
You bastards will pay when I sue you
For the tremendous brutality
For smoking weed
While most people receive citations
You punched me in the head
Kicked me to the floor
Blackened my eye
Bloodied up the nose
For ingesting danga and broke my arm
Said I resisted arrest
Nazi pig blessed man gay as hell
Prejudice too
Taking out frustration
Or raping unsuspecting men
You bite their cocks
Glad none of that happened to me
Medical attention is at hand
I'm still chained to this hospital bed
Then you'll laugh as if this were a joke
Throw me in a cell with bloodied up clothes
You punched me in the head, beat me in the ribs
Kicked me in the nose 'cause I'm not gay
Nazi pig blessed hag, you'll be shot
By Christ fearing men
Eradicate authority
Cops beat nimble
Cops beat quick
Crushing human faces with a nightstick
If people like this are sent to patrol the meek
Harassing civilians, terrorizing streets
Only smoked a joint, look at what they did to me
Beaten to a pulp
Your honor hear my plea
What I speak is the truth
Only smoked a joint
Honesty of my youth
And you'll treat me like shit
The justice system is a commodity
Designed to make money

Flying chunks of hot debris rushing through the air
Vapors causing blisters, eyes blinded by the glare
Clouds that shower death, hell falling from the sky
Searing rain of molten rock, flesh begins to fry
Burning fragments, steaming stones tearing through my skin
Lodging near my organs, I'm burning from within
Parts of human bodies lay strewn on the ground
Survivors holding bleeding ears, deafened by the sound
Blackened heavens raining down a mountain's weight of rock on top of us
Churning earth has somehow come to life
Rapid combustion spewing magma cracks apart the crust
Tornadoes of caustic steam ravaging the earth
Scalding hail
Charred and battered victims crying to be saved
Falling on deaf ears, the earth is now our grave
Devastating torrents, acid drowns the land
No relief from scalding hail burning like a brand
People shrieking a they die, pounded by the hail
Splintered shards, heated rock stabbing like a nail
Millions have been slaughtered as the boiling torrents falls
Apocalyptic storm, judgment for us all
Scalding hail

It's a dark day and the sun won't shine
Only the dark moon above the sky
Flower of lust, deceiver of trust you are
Leave your body and you will be free
This is beautiful death
Eternal sleep in the ocean floor
Cold waters feel so warm
Hate kills your dreams
Love gives you eternal sleep
Hate tears you apart and
Love won't melt your lonely heart
This is beautiful death
Eternal sleep in the ocean floor
Cold waters feel so warm
Leave your body and you will be free!

Oh, God forbid this bloody war
I see my knights falling one by one
so here I am, in this fight I'm alone
I'm stuck here in this hellhole on my own
Taste the blood, tears of pain
Memories from the past strike through my mind
My royal blood begins to boil
Deadly wounds can't stop me now, I still stand strong
I just can't die
Surrender is no option for me now
Bless those souls I send to hell
If you dare just look into my eyes
My steel is warm my face is stained with blood
One by one I hit them to the ground
One by one I see their heads roll
Anyone against me taste my sword
Anyone who'll challenge me will die!
You killed my men, raped my land and you ruined our lives
Still I stand, in command; in flames you burn
You will die, by my hand; forever you're condemned
'Cause I am in command; in flames you burn
No, it's no use for you to beg
I will send you down to hell
I can't die, my faith is far too strong
In the flames of hell is where you belong
One by one I hit them to the ground
One by one I see their heads roll
Anyone against me taste my sword
Anyone who'll challenge me will die
You killed my men, raped my land, and you ruined our lives
Still I stand, in command; in flames you burn
You will die, by my hand; forever you're condemned
'Cause I am in command; in flames you burn
You killed my men, raped my land, and you ruined our lives
Still I stand, in command; in flames you burn
You will die, by my hand; forever you're condemned
'Cause I am in command; in flames you burn
You burn
You burn
You burn!

Thrive mental genocide
Obscure the thoughts
As worlds collide in doubt
Hide in the shadow of the mass
In-different sense
Slave to digital disease
The evolution discharge
Relentless force
I'm in a world of no control
A system bound to drop dead
Dependent soul
Slave to digital disease
Great endless fear
The power of the inner word
Never to comprehend
It's all within your mind
Vortex of emotions
Surrounded by the plague
Technology of murder
Survival reaction in a terminal mindstrip
Terminal mindstrip
Soul in decay
Terminal mindstrip
Survival reaction in a terminal mindstrip
In-different sense
A slave to destiny

I'm the best you'll ever have
You're the best I'll never have
Pain
Gone.
Rain
Stop.
Sun
Shine.
You're
Mine.
Here kitty kitty kitty
Mommy mommy mommy mommy mommy
Here kitty kitty kitty
Listen:
Listen through the walls
The sound of quick footsteps sneaking down the hall
Whispers
The pages turning
The leaky roof
The toilet flushing
Numbers on the license plate
I'm nothing more than
The best you'll never have
A speck on your bedroom wall
A blood red waterfall
The best you will ever have(x3)
Your dead things are locked up inside
Blow smoke rings straight back in time
Roses floating out with the tide
Dance and sing under gunfire
Open wings slowly take flight
Around these parts a fly can live
A fly can live a thousand years
But a man cannot die soon enough, true enough
A smiling drunk nursing a glass of milk
A girl with a face like prison bread
Over the kitchen noise I hear them howl at me
A scabby ketchup bottle and a two-dollar bill
I guess its time to pay the bill, but you know I never will
I'm hungry still
Run away run away run away run away
Mercy killing on the way
Never thought I'd hear you say
Falling to your knees and pray now(x2)
In this crowded place I could swing a cat
And not even hit a soul
It's just the lonely vacuum of human black holes
And I'm as dry as these thirsty trees
With big city thou
Promising to set me free
"waiter, check please"
I'm the best you will ever have

I came here to see the stained glass
And God raising his hand in the temple's window
A ray of light is shinning through
The divine soul's prism in the temple's window
Inevitable events
Make me sick
I cannot pull myself together
I'm smashed to pieces
A ray of light shining through
I have my doubts
I came here to see the stained glass
And God raising his hand in the temple's window
A ray of light is shinning through
The divine soul's prism in the temple's window
I'm observing the autumn from hiding
I can see it in the temple's window
I came here for the smell of old wood
And warmth of marble floor
While seeking a way home

Preconditioned, accepting your role
Robbed of life and stripped of soul
Fall into the same routine
Of drab existence, what does it mean?
Are you satisfied with the way that you exist?
Every single day like the one before
Don't you feel the need to express the way you feel?
Wake your sleeping brain, there's so much more
Just a walking corpse
Preconditioned, accepting your role
Robbed of life and stripped of soul
Fall into the same routine
Of drab existence, what does it mean?
Are you satisfied with the way that you exist?
Every single day like the one before
Don't you feel the need to express the way you feel?
Wake your sleeping brain, there's so much more
Just a walking corpse
Just a walking corpse
Just a walking corpse

Turning the knife buried in your stomach I woke up
alive black with stain glistening
and new the sunset's coming
fingerpaintings of the insane come on and sterilize me
kneel down and idolize me
suck me
fuck me
resurrect me
rut me
cut me
and infect me
slice me
dice me
I wanna die
screamin the thoughts of dead babies
wiped away with my semen
bleed me
feed me
and inject me
feel me,
kill me
then dissect me

World of shadows too blind to cry
Worms crowded together to weak and want
Running from reflection to reflection
We measure the world with measure of our blindness
Can you see while looking at the shadows?
Can you touch the shapeless illusion?
Can you hear the echo of words never told?
Can you taste your own transitory notions?
One color of earth shimmering with different shades
Shapeless shadows independent of the light
Kneeling n the ruins of sacred towns
Crying on ashes of refuted truth
We shall remain and dream again
And moment of awakening is too short to recognize

A hundred suns, born to kill
It is madness, a sun created by man
Once again a perverse irony of life
Earth creates, man destroys
Love and hatred
We are the butchers of the earth
A hundred suns will be born
Millions of lives will fall
The first lightening,
A picture without protection and sense
The end, torture and death
When do they stop, when is it over?
One day they will all stand up,
Rebel against us, exterminated us
The first lightening,
A picture without protection and sense
A hundred suns, born to kill
It is madness, a sun created by man
Once again a perverse irony of life
Earth creates, man destroys
Love and hatred
We are the butchers of the earth
A hundred suns will be born
Millions of lives will fall
Born to kill

Blood still flows from an open wound.
In a room, one heart beats where there were two.
The killer had a knife and golden blonde hair.
Her eyes blue and black... they had been that way for years.
She planned her escape once the beatings begun.
But she did not know how to use a knife or a gun.
Alone again, and a fist to her face, he turned his back... she attacked!
One to the back and three to the heart.
After cleaning her blood stained hands, she got into her car and drove to Mexico.
The End

Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated
I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you
I get off on negativity
Makes me laugh to see your strife
I won't succumb to your numb
I owe nothing to no one
Are you sick of me
I don't care
Never be a kiss ass
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated
I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you
Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you
Throwing down

From the land of coldness,
Under the Northern vault of the sky,
Echoes the tune of yearning,
For the times of the sun and light
It's the bird of the midnight moment,
The swan of the brightest nights,
And the song about her leaving,
While the snow covers the ground
The brightest stars in darkness,
Lighting up the stage of the night,
On the soil so deeply frozen,
Lying the bird with wings so white
Eyes full of the deepest sadness,
Leaving now the final glance,
On the landscape of her kingdom,
On the stage of the final dance
This is the dance that I once learnt,
The dance of the dying flames,
The wistful song of the midnight bird,
Will my wings carry me once again
To the place so far I leave,
To the land of the whitest nights,
It's the time to say the last goodbye,
I'll take my final flight

Compassion no more, the angel sleeps in her blood.
Guilt will ruin... you rest no more.
I will always watch... until the last church is burned,
until the guilty drown in blood,
until your preachers of filth cease to be.
Everyday I hope...I hope that your end will bring a better day.
Fuck your god, your god of shit.
Our sin will send the death we wish upon you.
For the families you've broken,
for the lies you have ruined, we burn the last of you down.
"Now you will receive us. We do not ask for your poor, or for your hungry.
We don't want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil that will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down everyday.
We will spill their blood till it bleeds down from the sky."
Now you will receive us, receive the arsonist.

coming home after the war
all that's left is a prisoner of two worlds
the past is red of all the blood I spilled
the future's black because there is no hope
nothing is sacred to me
i want you, father, to fall on your knees
in the desert far away
my slaughtered innocence left to decay
recollections of battles without end
and the lifes I took with my bare hands
nothing is sacred to me
i want you, father, to fall on your knees
so I walked into that church
and that's when I killed him
the blood I spilled just yesterday
as if that pleasure had never been away
stabbing the fucking life out ot him
i learned the trade, I always win
nothing is sacred to me
i want you, father, to fall on your knees
the blood I spilled just yesterday
as it that pleasure had never been away

This will make corpses of us all.
Old world burns and drives the machine of war.
Now close your eyes and picture your last sunset.
Sun has failed and moon is dead.
With hearts entwined laid to rest.
With slit throats now you see the joke of ever believing in me.
I'll be the shoulders to die on when truth doesn't set you free.
Crucify me one more time just so I can watch myself bleed.
There was a time when I thought my soul was saved but it was a little too slow and a little too late.
At the time I thought it meant everything, turns out it didn't mean anything.
It didn't mean anything.
I pray to god this kills you.
I pray this kills us both. [2x]
I'm begging for youth suicide and third term abortion.
I'm here to see purity's crucifixion and witness a genocide initiative.
Genocide initiative.
You'll have to cut away the smiles on my face after I get a taste.
Now close your eyes and picture your last sunset.
Sun has failed and moon is dead.
With hearts entwined laid to rest.
With slit throats now you see the joke of ever believing in me.
I'll be the shoulder to die on when truth doesn't set you free.
Crucify me one more time just so I can watch myself bleed.
There was a time when I thought my soul was saved but it was a little too slow and a little too late.
At the time I thought it meant everything, turns out it didn't mean anything.

To believe is to deceive
Down on knees you're choked on memories
Turned into lies of pure demise
Below to lay far beyond the day
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to crawl
Into the darkness of deaths
Forever ceased to be
(on the) ways to the grave
A flickering mind in the life rewind
Thoughts pierced and hanged on hooks
Suffering hell inside a human shell
Your body will break and crack to dust
Die - it's time to pay for all your sins
Die - consciousness devoured by a cell of soil
Die - punished and doomed as a liar
Die - hope shall be buried with maggots to coil
The presence fades away to betray
All your hope is gone
There is none there to bring light
And out of sight you pay in mental decay
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to rot
Into the darkest of deaths
It all ends here in euphoria and fear
The last sight is your only light in total pain
Portrayed insane
Lungs burst by vomits nursed
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to rot
Into the darkest of deaths
Forever ceased to be
(on the) ways to the grave

I'll blame your scapegoat
for all your sins
You fix the broken
I'll break your mends
it's hard to give in
it's hard to bend
this world of deceit incites revenge, and...
fashion your look
fashion your smile
stack all policies laugh at follies
pass some down

Subject to liability you say, well at least it was worth it to see your head
sliced in half like a tomato. Roots sewn by your blood and then nurtured
through your kisses. Crawling themselves effortlessly through my skin
manifesting on my insides, they grow and then pull me apart from the
intestines our while postmortem thoughts whirl around my head. How could I be
so blind? Evilness disguises itself so well. I'm better now anyway. Better
left for dead

The entities of my lost dominion
Those majestic bringers of chaos and wisdom
Lead the rain of our discontent
To this precious land we have returned
To this decayed glory we have mourn...
But for what reason the temple of magnificence has been corrupted?
We have lost all the aura of greatness
This fight we now endure is the penance we must suffer
In the search of all that was, and again shall never be...
Mindbending atmosphere of irrevocable doubts
A sign of the strange anxiety that always have been within myself
Am I not a warrior?
Yes, the proudest of all, lost in the foreboding darkness
That covers the land of The Chasm
A dark cloud of hate
The infinite flame that burns this dream
A sad message...

[Music by: Callenish Circle]
[Lyrics by: Jos Evers & Patrick Savelkoul]
Once a mighty tribe full of pride
one with nature till white man arrived
They came for trade in name of their king
Exchanging slavery and hate
Dying of violence and foreign disease
Defending their holy ground
Their native belief
Exiled from their land
Deprived from their faith
Brave warriors in battle were slain
For centuries condemned to live in reservations
Another example of so-called annihilation
After all those years nothing is changing
Prejudice and death are still here reign

I see the eyes of the darkness, beyond the fire
Where the starts seem to be crying
In this green valley, I let go out my desire
For some peace and quiet I'm dying
My song is strong over the gale
Like a nightfall rending the air
Cloaked in the light of the blaze, I am waiting
For the return of my fate
I never try to find and nothing makes me cry
Where I could spend my life
By the sea, in my sleep, I can breathe the cold wind
And this frozen wind recalls me that I have never dreamed
I still can't awake. There's no sun there's no day
Pierced by the lance of the pain... I'm not afraid!
I feel like a solitary desert swept by the wind
Here, sweet voices whisper me
Everything is still the same in my dreams
I don't want to fall asleep
My song is strong over the gale
Like a nightfall rending the air
Cloaked in the veil of the night, I'm lying
I sense the end in my mind
I never try to find and nothing makes me cry
Where I could spend my life
By the sea, in my sleep, I can breathe the cold wind
And this frozen wind recalls me that I have never dreamed
I still can't awake. There's no sun there's no day
Pierced by the lance of the pain... I'm not afraid!
Cloaked in the light of the blaze, I am waiting
For the return of my fate
I never try to find and nothing makes me cry
Where I could spend my life
By the sea, in my sleep, I can breathe the cold wind
And this frozen wind recalls me that i have never dreamed
I still can't awake. There's no sun there's no day
Pierced by the lance of the pain... I'm not afraid!

Severed me roots of dead family trees
Finding the damage inside
(Of me)
Parting blood red seas on bended knee
Too much to ask when it's so hard to breathe
No way out, tearing my soul to finally see
The real wreckage between
(You and me)
A cold grin for those damned at my door
My hanging heart for your product of war
No way out, cutting myself for clarity
I just keep falling into darkness
Cutting myself for clarity
Just keep falling
No way out, cutter cutting myself for clarity
I just keep falling into darkness
Cutting myself for clarity
Just keep falling one way down, no way out

Weak the body and the sould
Poor the body and the mind
Lost the vision as a whole
Shame and disgrace to the kind
Drift around directionless
No clue what occurred to me
Got myself into a mess
Swallowed down by misery
Body - Body - Body
Versus
Mind - Mind - Mind
Versus
Soul - Soul - Soul
This was then but this is now
Find your own identity
This was then but this is now
Truth lies in intensity
Time for change
Metamorphosis - Metamorphosis
History repeats itself
At the point of no return
Decay's put back on the shelves
Dying flame is back to burn
Energy is streaming back
Removes weakness frame by frame
New beginning's taking shape
Destiny recalls my name
This was then but this is now
Regained power and control
This was then but this is now
On the edge but burning slow.

Quaestio nostra est aeterna
Ultima requies fons vitae
Sed eam ut novam ducemus
We will never know all possibilities to predict what is to come
And so we have illusions to think freely
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be blind enough to live the life we live right now
Who possesses your time also possesses your mind
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be deaf enough to live the life we live right now
Reach out, touch infinity
Life is just a memory
Time is not the entity
Like it used to be
The Divine Conspiracy
Opens up the reality
Time is not the entity
Like it claims to be
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be insensitive to live the life and so ignore it all
Who possesses your time also possesses your mind
Who possesses your time
-Mislead us all, we are not in control
Also possesses your mind
-There is no trace that will lead to this place
Reach out, touch infinity
Life is just a memory
Time is not the entity
Like it used to be
The Divine Conspiracy
Opens up the reality
Time is not the entity
Like it claims to be
Desperately we all
Clutch at the last straw
We stumble and fall
Countdown to die
To heal it all
We will never reach
Our capacities, no more
We cannot expand
Our boundaries
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be insensitive to breathe so we can take it all for granted
Reach out, touch infinity
Life is just a memory
Time is not the entity
Like it used to be
The Divine Conspiracy
Opens up the reality
Time is not the entity
Like it claims to be

Living up to an image
Easier said then done
Where it took him was nowhere
Always on the run
From the one who was knocking on his door
Take his weight off his back
Won't you take it away
Give up the pride you had
The security you never had
Not for me, but for yourself
Full circle, you turned around
Take this weight

The blackened city calls out
Enter the temple of sin
You must enter the temple of sin
Contorted sinners beckon
Join out twisted rites
You must join out twisted rites
The priests eyes gleam
Blood on their scepters of flesh
The nubile virgin bows
Await the piercing thrust
She awaits the piercing thrust
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Praise the gods of sin
Her walls are burning
Grinding the staff of the priests
Sluts grinding the staff of the priests
The congregation
Revel in sins of the flesh
Whores from the temple
Serving shamanic desire
They are serving shamanic desire
Deviant bodies writhing
Slick with the fluids of lust
They are slick with the fluids of lust
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure
Statues of demons glisten with sweat
The orgy intensifies, violence begins
Flagellate sluts with serpentine whips
They raise their blades to throats of their men
Climax approaches and the blood will spill
Sexual sacrifice, mutilation and death
Murder
Priests of Sodom
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure

The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle
Frosted
Beards on pale grey faces
Eyes of death
Are burning with rage
Glancing across the fields of Tyr
In the early morning light
Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground
The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle
War cries break the silent wait
Charging warriors rush to kill
Swords are swung in the air
The gods of war are called
Vikings with fire in soul
Clash on the open field
Slaying with powerful strokes
The snow is turning red
Hooves gallop the plains
Warlords on horsebacks
Ride into battle
With a thunderous roar
The storm wind of death
Blows across the field
Sweeping with it
Everything in its way
So the battle settles
Alone stands just one man
Under the grey-clouded winter sky - alone. . .

Meet your maker
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix to the sky
So intense, so glorious...
Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great lawgiver
So high and mighty
The immaculate deception
A taker of life
With unbridled aggression
Striking down on the disbelievers
Savage - Messiah
Take us higher
Savage - Messiah
Take us now!
Blessed in blood
We are reborn in hate
Thousands of spirits cry
So intense, so glorious...
Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great Messiah
So high and mighty

Works of art, painted black
Magniloquent, bleeding dark
Monotonous palate, murky spectrum, grimly unlimited
Food for thought, so prolific
In contrasting shades, forcely fed
Abstraction, so choking, so provocative
A canvas to paint, to degenerate
Dark reflections, degeneration
A canvas to paint, to denigrate
Dark reflections, of dark foul light
Profound, aesthetic beauty
Or shaded, sensary corruption
Perceptions, shattered, splintered, mirroring
In deft taints, diluted, tinted
Spelt out, in impaired colour
Denigrating, going to paints to pain, not a pretty picture
Works of heart bleeding dark
Black, magniloquent art
Monotonous palate, murky spectrum, grimly unlimited
Prolific food for thought
Contrasting, fed with force
Abstraction, so choking, so provocative

"Drowned in Torment" by Bolt Thrower
Pray in your dreams that tomorrow won't wake you
Plead for the darkness of life to forsake you
From death to new life the path that awaits you
You can't begin to start to bear the taste, the morning after dark
Close your eyes so that you can't see
The reality of your tormented agony
Drowned in torment your will shall break you
The scars of war remains to haunt you
Fell the cold hands of death grasping for you
As you drown in torment... drown

Pain!
Ride it baby.
Cracks his brain,
just enough to buy lots of gibberish

Deep blue in ultraviolet
I'm the pilot of these stars
My world is in slow motion
Frozen ocean rain of fire
We make love
And as we do it's strange and violent
I feel you
Coming through in waves of ultraviolet
Unlock the door to your mind
Let's see how high you can fly
Come on, come on I'll take you all
I am the pilot of the star chamber
You burn as I explore you
Deep within your waves of fire
You dream but I'm the masterFlying faster breathing fire
We make love
And as we do the sky is starlit
I feel you
And as I do your ultraviolet
Unlock the door to your mind
Let's see how high you can fly
Come on, come on I'll take you all
I am the pilot of the stars
We make love
And as we do it's strange and violent
We make love, make love, make love
We make...
We make love
And as we do it's strange and violent
I feel you
And as I do your ultraviolet
Unlock the doors to your mind
Let's see how high you can fly
Come on, come on I'll take you all
I am the pilot of the stars
Close your eyes and come inside
Let's see how high we can fly
Come in, come on I'll show you all
I am the pilot of the star chamber

Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
Twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole
Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity
The smell was unbearable As I unburied her
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
Down her throat, swallow
Eyes glassy and vacant
Body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
Tonguing her rotted anus
I need a live woman
To fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill
Her body exceptional
She thought I was normal
But I wanted more
I came blood inside of her
Choking on the clot
Gagging on the snot
Gushing blood, from her mouth
Bloody gel leaking out
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
Slit my own cock with a knife
Violent, climax Serging serum on my skin
Back from the dead
I am resurrected to spew, putrefaction

Surtur comes from the south
With red hot fire wargods swords
Shines like the sun
Mountains breaks, men on hel-road
The heaven crumbles, Ragnarok is at hand
Then to Hlin appears
Another grief when Odin goes to fight
The evil Fenris
And the brave and glory Frey
Goes against Surtur
Then will Friggs beloved one die
Vidar,odin's mighty son,
He will come to slay the wolf
The sword runs into the
Heart of Hverdrungs son
So he avenges his father
So comes Llodyns noble son
Thor he goes to fight the snake
In anger he slays the guardian of Midgaard
Nine steps dying walks Odin's son
Away from the snake who misdeeds not fear
Dying from it venom
When all are gone
Only Surtur remained
Passing his hand of fire
Across the whole world
Consuming all of creation

Mother winter leaves our land
And opens wide the seas
The lukewarm breeze does beckon me
As it whispers through the trees
It says: Set your sails
And let me take your ship to foreign shores
Take farewell of those near you
And your land of the North!
The wild cold deep black ocean's waves
Invites my hungry heart
Cry not my love I'll return
Only death can keep us apart
Oden in the sky up high
Let the Ravens of yours fly
To guide us on our sail to foreign shores
Let your Ravens fly
The wind blows through my hair
fills our sails with hope and pride
Caress these lines of Oak, wind
Do not throw us all aside
The wild cold deep black ocean's waves
As wide as sky above
Carry us, oh, Gods of sea
Don't take us down below
Now approach the shore at dawn
All is still the light of daybreak is yet to be born
Clad in morning dew asleep
The city's walls rise before us men from the seas
Carrying cold steel at our sides
No time to lose at sunbirth we attack the city by surprise
Down the coastlines with the wind we reign
Men of the North we leave the shores in flames
Shores in Flames
Fire!
Thor of thunder way up high
Swing your Hammer that cracks the sky
Send the wind to fill our sails and take us home
Guide your sons, us, home
When the wind cries out my name
And time has come for me to die
Then wrap me in my cape
And lay my sword down at my side
Then place me on a ship of Oak
And let it drift with tide
Let the flames purify my soul
On its way to hall up high
Up high
Fire!

End of life eternal fight nuclear desolation
End your life eternal
fight nuclear desolation End of life
eternal fight nuclear desolation
End your life eternal fight nuclear desolation

The calendar year is an imperial narrative. The seven-day week is an imperial infliction. Circannual holidays are imperial flag-posts. Mechanical time is an imperial installation. The merchant workday is an imperial offering. Greenwich MeanTime is an imperial sanction. The looming weight, uniformly imposed; as albatross and as anchor. The new time-imperialists will get their way with those left: the rural, the feral, the frail. Feed them a thread, that leads to a string. They'll follow the string, until it leads to a rope, and from that rope every vestige of what was will be hung by the neck.

Sorcerers and shamans, weave your spells of war,
Ensure our mighty sword-arms are the strongest and the quickest.
Entwine us with great battle magic 'til we stand knee-deep in gore,
And by all the gods, we'll ride to where the fray rages the thickest!
(THE WAR-SONG OF THE WOLVES OF CAYLEN-TOR,
AS HEARD AT THE BATTLE OF BLACKHELM VALE)

Sweet, sweet sensation,
Across my back
I will be following you,
No retreat
Turning back now
[Chorus:]
At night time
Just to cross the trails
Flood control
On that wall
Sealed between cracks
Hide, hide the violence
He returns the gun
Retreat within yourself
Retreat within yourself
Switch the station
Across my back
?????
And we turn them back
[Chorus]
He is coming back
Hiding with no one else
No chance to acquire
Retreat within yourself

[Lyrics by A]
I am your sins
i am your mind
All throught i'm you
hear my call
Sacrifice!
I possess you
into the deepest black hole
i am the creature
you fear
I am the demon
in your head
i ride the darkest
Thoughts in your mind
You cant see throught it
death blocks your eyes
this is not a dream
this is reality
Sacrificing demons
come and join my unholy soul
this is our first day
it has just begun
Unholy Sacrifice!

hello my friend, hope it's the end
no saving grace, no words to tell
since emotions explode
solidifly sorrowproof shields
try to reconstruct my world
from broken frames of the past
entering final chapter
embittered daybreak surrounds
virus in veins
elusive pain
forever blind
first strike is deadly & now death becomes me
convicing concept well excused
nail biting show, exciting view
world famous victims - opening night
commercial breakdown, tense sinews graps
drive needle in, solution - choke
third degree filth
rope, dagger, bullet - a friend or a foe
uneasy movement - in for the kill
senses slow down
bite helping hand
zero in on me
scratching the surface & now death becomes us
feels like I'm doing it for a first time
forced to play this ugly scene
an actor without screenplay
in a virgin suicide
forward to exit, shivering & stoned
insipidlifestyle - rat race control
transfigured angels with no choice at all
taking their own lives - you're next in line

You tell yourself that you've been had
'Cause even dead you still seem sad
Robbed of your peace of mind
Letting the cares of this
World take control
Why don't you just pass it by
Allow the renewing of your mind to
Take it's place
Was it better for you when
You were alive
Rotting contentedly in your old life
Strung out on what you can find
Injecting confusion to the new found grace
Why don't you just let it go
Allow the renewing of your mind to
Take it's place
Even dead you still seem so sad
Get a life and make us all glad
The stench dwells
All around you
Get a life, let light surround you
Robgbed of your peace of mind
Letting the cares of this
World take control
Why don't you just pass it by
Allow the renewing of your mind to
Take it's place

your fashion, kills trends to their end
your cycle of nonsense bleeds to its core, repeats once again
perfection, best play by the rules
this shit by you false-core will kill your own trip
play you the fool
kill trend suicide
false-core genoocide
the fashion, gone glory to capitalist ways
faceless, sold into corporate ways
no vision or thought is what you get out, fight for your own belief
for in the end you must give in, fuck off trend casualties
this way,
that way,
no way,
well anyway

Are my hands not black?
Black with the filth of this ageless denial?
From the first birthing breath, to the stillness of death
The light of the "right" has been deceived
And thus we live our lives
Always one step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell
One act that will free us
Shattering the spell
Beaten by the lies of failure's conquest
One step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell
When every breath's a warning and every moment a sign,
Lay me amidst the pinewood walls to regain what once was mine
All's pale
Shattering the spell
Flesh pales
Shattering the spell
Are my hands not red?
Red with the truth that has conquered denial?
From the first broken vow, to the last fighting breath
The light of the "right" has been deceived
And thus we die
What's left, left for the living?
In the eyes of the purest truth?
What's left, left for the living?
In the arms of denial's only son?
When every breath's a warning and every moment a sign,
Lay me amidst the pinewood walls to regain what once was mine
All's pale
Shattering the spell
Flesh pales
Shattering the spell
And thus we live our lives
Always one step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell
One act that will free us
Shattering the spell
Beaten by the lies of failure's conquest
One step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell

When she's sad the world is lonely
Silver clouds are crying only
For the pain she feels
So deep inside
The love she thought would save her
Has somehow now enslaved her
To a dream she though she wanted
To come true
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
Of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
For the feelings you can't hide
When she smiles the world it shines
But the silver clouds are only there
To hide the distant storm
That's coming soon
The love she let surround her
Has become the waves that drown her
In the sea of ever-changing
Warmth and cold
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
Of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
For the feelings you can't hide
You can fly
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
Of your dream
When the nightmares ensue
All that you can do is paint your sky
Another brighter shade of blue
Spread your wings you can glide
Above the violent storms
That plague your life
You paint the picture blue or grey
Fly away

Observe the change.
Australian's thoughts are rearranged into the past.
The populous is telling me, hope you enjoy the backward journey.
Tolerance is only shown when the dollar can be grown.
We're going back to fighting wars for our politician's cause.
With saddened eyes I have observed.
Acceptance fall away to dust.
I'm moving backwards as I take a step forth.
The winds of hate are blowing strong in my world.
It all affects you and I.
Next generation pays the price.
All this hatred is tearing us down, as we ignore our own advice.
Now we're finding as we move into the past.
Who are we fooling?
Good things never last.
Accept the difference, between you and I.
Bring on extinction of the human kind.
The is a backward journey.

project sodom and gomora.
aids and its homosexual host are to be gentically altered
out of existence to heterosexual perfections.
science, like government and god, is not big on being queer.

Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arms across the bed
You make no move
You never do
Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage, own my scars
They paint a broke life's shattered art
And time won't turn my wretched world
(To stand in your shadow is to be home)

Do you see it, do you see it
Do you see it, it's coming at you
Do you see it, do you see it
Can if feel it, it's coming at you
Do you see it, can you feel it
Coming at you, making you sick
Look around, what do you see
A world of lies and misery
It knows what's in your head
All your thoughts that's never said
A disease, it's all around
Just a shadow without a doubt
You've seen my people around you die
No rhyme or reason to say good bye
On the ground or in the air
Maybe cancer to spread fear
It's own god, it's own religion
Taking life, it's addiction
It's in church, it's in your schools
Teaching something you can't learn
You're not safe, young or old
for death's coming, so I've been told
Do you see it, do you see it
Do you see it now, It's coming at you

[Music and Lyrics by James Malone]
To celebrate the guilt (the lies of whispering shadows)
And tattoo their words upon your ever-scarring flesh.
(Beaten, reject, follow)
To make believe there is no guilt, to wield the liar's dagger,
And clasp his hand to celebrate the countless unborn bastards.
To praise the guilt some more, in the eyes of the fallen.
Embracing the swine, this foreplay strangulation.
(Beaten, diseased, hollow)
Though your disease is ever mine, I give you diamonds.
And in an act to seal the oath, I gave you roses, be careful of the fucking thorns.
In your eyes I saw the end, and these were your words, the promise of never.
Denial, protect whats promise, of the fact that our feeling dissolve.
I took your evil skin away with the blade of the liar's dagger,
And clasped your hand to celebrate your vile unborn bastard.
Denial, protect whats promise, of the fact that our feeling dissolve.
Though your disease is ever mine, I gave you diamonds.
And in an act to seal the oath, I gave you roses, be careful of the f**king thorns.
In your eyes I saw the end, these were your words, the promise of never.

See your faith
See the wind
Your sealed fate
It's happened again
False convictions
Fake intentions
You still think that you get one more time around
False convictions
Fake intentions
You still think that you get one more time around
Sticking hard to your convictions
Convictions of nothing
Lying smiles to yourself
Self diluted dreams
Smiling wide
Head held high
This is how it seems
Step the plate
Accept your fate
Brave reality
False convictions
Fake intentions
You still think that you get one more time around
False convictions
Fake intentions
You still think that you get one more time around
False convictions
Fake intentions
You still think that you get one more time around
Wake up and choke...
Choke...
Wake up and choke.

[Music & Lyrics Aydan]
And this journey begins --
With the beat of wings of lark
Her wake ravishing - skyforged spark
Gold-leaves are falling, all beasts are
Howling, the signs are clear!
The forces are near -
The crows say that someone will die
Embraces and fear - they tell no lies
Searching for new roads, sacrifice your
Blood, the signs are clear!
Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
All through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
You are free to choose your fate
Now make your choice
Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining in
Fading lights
May you read the meanings, it's your lot
The journey comes to an end -
The lark plunged with sun into sea
All you love and defend -
Belongs to you and me
Pagan traditions of forgotten missions,
The signs are clear!
Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
All through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
You are free to choose your fate
Now make your choice
Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining
In fading lights
May you read the meanings
Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Search for the fibres,
The dwelling light net of Wyrd
Roaming souls on branch of Mother Earth

Fearless on my final quest
Find truth beyond the flesh
Fleeting past my dreams of unfulfilled desire
My strength unwavering
My journey just beginning
A desperate race through the corridors of hell
Chaos emerges - Surrender I will not
The last enemy is falling
Here I am - To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling
Here I stand - To conquer death itself
Funeral silence beneath the burning cross
My immortal soul sleeps with the wolves tonight
Skin and bones that rot my blood runs dry
See me die to rise with the gods again
Defy...Decay
Arise again
Chaos emerges
Surrender I will not

Darkness - In every line and word i'm singing
Demons - Haunting me whenever I think
Nightfall - A dying man
Nightfall - Yes i am
Beasts inside me roar
The dark one is my name
Allright, here's the dark one speaking
I introduce my mental world to you
Breaking living nothingness
That's what I will do - be careful!
My words are in your hands
And they measure good and bad
Maybe they attract you
But you should read between the lines
I rule the night, it's my home, I welcome you
Die Nacht ist mein, und ich lad dich herzlich ein
I hunt the light, for more than one decade
'Cause i am the dark one, the dark one I am
Selfhood - I hate you
Dullness - and you too
I decry you all
For dark one is my name
Hey you, do you hear my words
I hope you do, and feel it too
Blaming mortal selfishness
That's what I will do - I mean it!
This is my other side
I'm not only a dark one,
As I have a pulsing heart
For all who care

I lived in a nightmare just good and said no
gone with a feeling the made us so cold
while getting the madness it's crawling in us
solitary psycho a sickening badness
Solitary psycho
no way out fearing yourself
forever your're banned
Solitary psycho
counting the days healing myself
forever your're damned
Loose one's mind and wreck one's brain
lifethoughts are foreign to our nature
slow inner decay no reason left
solitary psycho a sickening badness
Has it been the right way and even allowed
knowing it keeps on progressing
all those reflections thinking about
dogma never miscarries

Forty people or more, tied to hands and feet
Awaiting strangulation, darkening deceit
Rope around the neck, eyes falling out slow
Extreme asphyxiation, blackened murder flow
Your eyes start to spray, panic in dismay
Death wish appearing fast
Insanity supreme, praying to be free
Guts explode in a blast
Gasping for breath as you faint into death
Black hallucinations and shadows ahead
Severed and maimed, body is drained
Swarming of flies round the dead
Bodies split in five, bodies float in carnage
Mass strangulation
Hysteric conjuration
Macabre infestation
Worship defecation
Soul evisceration
Death hallucination
Malignant humiliation
Ritualistic suffocation

Compelling thirst
Crimson lust
The need to drain you dry
My lips pressed to your laceration
See death in my eyes
Thirsting
Drinking
Fading is your thinking
I fiend for your blood
I must have your blood

So, the sight has finally left us
With dreams of the failing light.
Born again, beneath ashen cloud
And the restless lies betrothed,
I curse this winter.
And my nightmares become your dreams,
Come blindness, stealing grief.
On failing winds of hopeless greed
And blindness lead the light,
I curse these winter eyes.
Beneath ashen cloud,
I curse this winter.
Beneath ashen cloud.
I curse this winter.
And my nightmares become your dreams,
Come blindness, stealing grief.
On failing winds of hopeless greed
And blindness lead the light,
I curse these winter eyes.
An ashen cloud of hopeless splendor,
A robe of ice unsurrendered.
A slave to this kingdom winter
Under skies of fire falling.
Falling, falling, falling.
So, the applause have ended,
The plague, lost within sleep.
The last right of spring, now lays beneath.
A shroud of fire as the winds sing...
We curse this winter.
And my nightmares become your dreams,
Come blindness, stealing grief.
On failing winds of hopeless greed
And blindness, lead the light.
I curse these winter eyes.

Destroyers in nature
It's just the fabric of us, our mistakes feeble-minded
Moderate to severe idiocy
The "most intelligent" creatures on the planet
An advanced civilization, which says nothing at all
Humans
Like US
We, the people
We, the morons
Apparently non-educable idiots
We are horrible people
This is a fire
This is the gasoline
Insects attract to the flame
And turn to pitch all the same
Our presence here threatening
Habitats de-evolve a mutant parody
Our hands are hammers the earthen anvil
All life in between disinterred and destroyed
You looked into the eyes of the beast
You extended your hand in trust
It so graciously accepted the fate
There's no honor in betrayal
O the savages, the ravagers of the pleading, standing there bleeding
Tears of the innocent turned into mammalian dissidents
We the people we the terrible
The war has been waged
Us vs them vs life vs cage
Inherently exiled from a life on an earth abundant with prosperity
O the hearts of men, their blood so thin with original sin
Tears of the innocent - turned into mammalian dissidents
Our presence here threatening
Habitats de-evolve a mutant parody
Our hands are hammers the earthen anvil
All life in between disinterred and destroyed
Destroyers in nature
It's just the fabric of us, our mistakes feeble-minded
Moderate to severe idiocy
The "most intelligent" creatures on the planet
An advanced civilization, which says nothing at all
Humans
Like US
We, the people
We, the morons
No single inferior race
We're all apparently idiots
We, the people, are horrible

We've waited far too long to,
Watch it all crash and fall through
So when you feel like shit you've gotta
Keep on pushing
If you saw the world through my eyes
Then you wouldn't feel so high rise
It's time to take our chance,
You've gotta sit, back, and, hold tight
There's Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them
I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become
We've become
The more I think
The more I wish I would stop, and hit rewind
What I would give to have or take back then,
When no-one really cares
I remember when we all used to
Kick back, and take days off school
So many times I'd smile
Many times I've cried,
But never did we try
Never did we try
There's Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them
I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become
Its haunting me I'm so alone
I just want to find my way back home
I'm so alone
There's Forces working in our heads
But we don't understand them
I need a map to find my way out all the time
There's Curses Lurking in our heads
But we don't want to find them
We need to come back down and face what we've become

I want to tear my thorn away
The shadow of my end
Once more I see less than yesterday
The vision escapes
I cry for oblivion
The obscure image embracing me
Alone I can't heal what once was scarred
Still reminder
Slowly - I spread myself open
Willing - To float through this rain
Slowly - This emptiness is turning to pain
Again - I draw back in fear
Deep inside me something always screams
But I hide it all under my skin
I wouldn't want to masquerade
Deep inside me something always screams
But I just keep myself still
I can't care of anything anymore
Injured by a blade of black
As I tear my chest open
Take this dream I hold
It's cracked and it tears me
Take it as I hold up for you
I don't want it anymore
Maybe I've just always been
The one to await the dawn shall not rise
I don't want to be
To exist in the world of lies

Trapped in a downward spiral of pain
Horrific memories, your life flashing by
There is no life left for you to live
You've had your share and more
Act of transfusion, blood child!
Transmigrate into the future or the past
Eternal damnation awaits you my love
In the kingdom of the sick and the rotting dead
You will suffer excruciating pain
You shall now reap the twisted fruit
Of what you once sowed
Transparent, revealing the lies
Transmutation, what you have become
Act of transfusion, blood child!
Transmigrate into the future or the past
Transmigration macabre

"The gods are great, I am the greatest"
Mother of earth, mother of all
Father of air, father of all
Brother in flames
Sister of seas
Gods of my world, behold...
Flame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need
Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers, the hive of oceans
Praise the father's of all significance
The reckless burden of existence
I ace the rise of the furious
The amend forces
The amend course
Gods of my world, behold...
Pour rain on the fire
The fire that burns
The day of my birth
Gods of my world, behold...
Flame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need
Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers, the hive of oceans
Recollection, my soul connection
The thrive of reflection, affection
Forever you'll be the tongue of mine
Through time and existence
By instincts divine
Forever you'll be the sight of mine
Through time and existence
By visions divine

Listen it's still parted
This doesn't match the price I pay
What you end up saying
Is what you swore you'd never say
Well, I like you like you like me
I pass out wolf tickets
Nothing's left and nothing's right
Looks as dark as can be
Maybe I'm as weird to you
As you are to me
Well, I like you like you like me
I pass out wolf tickets
I'll be as blunt as I can be
Stay away from me
"There are more people alive today than have ever died
Now, if this is true
And if you believe in reincarnation
It means there are a lot of people around without souls
Doesn't that make sense?
I've met some of them
Haven't you?"
We're all just humans down here
Big or small
But some can be so full of
Nothing at all
Well, I like you like you like me
I pass out wolf tickets
I'll be as blunt as I can be
Stay away from me

Another day another town another city
It's all the same
And I used to find comfort in all of this
It's an excuse to deviate from the norm
Pathetic isn't it
After all these years still not content
Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great would it be to end it all
Another show another state another country
It has always been the same
Commanding troops just like a general
Leading the warriors into a battle
Pathetic isn't it
After all these years, still not content
Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great would it be to end it all
Why bother it won't satisfy
Nothing ever does
The pills, the love, the recognition and support
I live to die rot and decay
Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great would it be to end it all
How great would it be to run away

Once a day I wink at you
And you grin like a puma
I watch as you spend an hour or two
In the bath like a tuna
One times I love you
Two times I love you
Three times, four times, five times
I love you, you, you, ooh
Twice a week, I take a peek
As you bathe like a reptile
I catch your eye and you throw your sponge
It's a soaking projectile
One times I love you
Two times I love you
Three times, four times, five times
I love you, love you, love you, ooh

You tried so hard to break me
To make me bend
But I have stood the test of time
Well, I've had a taste of glory
And I've seen the hell below
It's time for me to take what's mine
[Chorus]
Target acquired
We open fire
This operation
Annihilation
So many come and go
They're changing like the wind
A product from a factory
Well, I've only got one mission
And I will stand my ground
Something called integrity
[Chorus: x2]
Well, this is a retribution
And this is my revenge
This is a resolution
Committed till the end
Till the end
I say, till the end
Wait till the end
Well, I stand here in my silence
Content, my soul at rest
This is what I do it for, yeah
But to the leeches
The liars and the thieves
Just know I always win the war, yeah
[Chorus: x2]
Fire, fire

The chair's been kicked, a rope tied to the rafters
Blue faced and broken necked, I sigh
Relieving my vision from the sick mocking stare
Of that hated sun burning the sky
Slumped like a headless scarecrow
Cold and limp against the wall
Blood paints a pattern of rohrschach's design
Thawing the winter that burdens this heart
Shit-stained and shameful
An exit in disgrace
Not a splash but just a ripple left
I end this life in vain
In the dead of the darkness, I breach the still lake
Towards the reflection of the moon
The night colored liquid arresting my lungs
Finally in peace in this watery tomb
Destroy this fragile body
To be gorged upon by worms
Not a splash but just a ripple is left
In the wake of my merciless scorn
Beyond those cursed stars above
Lies the answer that I seek
On the backs of bullets rides my name
Longing to kiss my cheek
Resentfully decline retire this hated life
Without guilt, I break these veins
Carved with salvation's knife
Turn not away, avert not your face
This is how it was meant to be
In silence found hanging there above a pool of waste
The beauteous workings of mortality
No one can truly touch another
Parallel never to cross
Pointless fumbling, sad mistake
Only capable of pain
Beyond those cursed stars above
Lies the answer that I seek
On the backs of bullets rides my name
Longing to kiss my cheek
Resentfully decline, retire this hated life
Without guilt I break these veins
Carved with salvation's knife
Beyond those cursed stars above
Lies the answer that I seek
On the backs of bullets rides my name
Longing to kiss my cheek
Resentfully decline retire this hated life
Without guilt I break these veins
Carved with salvation's knife
Beyond those cursed stars above
Lies the answer that I seek

[originally by Wire]
I never know which version I'm going to be
I seem to have so many choices open to me
It's not hard to see another unique event
When you miss the beginning and you miss the end
I've got forty versions all dying to get the part
And so with a change of mind comes a change of heart
A total eclipse arrives now and Niagra falls
No loss of life yet and no further calls
I never know which version I'm going to be
I get the feeling my mind is deceiving me
In between are
Where only edges can be seen of the spaces

Furious winds, sky grows black, circum polar vortex
Weather changing patterns causing solar storms
Living on the San Andreas fault line
I feel the earth shake, ground splits open wide
Massive tidal waves, seaports flood
Power lines fall, bridges rip apart
Cars drop into the sea, crimson stench rises up
Obscuring the light, gas lines burst out in flames
Water starts gushing everywhere
Sharks wait to claim their prey
No one will survive on this day
The West Coast slips into the sea
The worst quake in world history

Here she comes down, as her wings get nailed to the ground
A polaroid of shame
The last angel's pathetic fame
The face of deceit with nails in her feet
She's a preacher deprived from her voice
A punctured lung is creating noise
The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child
The revocation of empathy
The sound from a million dreams and scars
Termination Bliss
Blessed under a lie, Her last little weak "why?"
The bloody end of a dream
Slit the throat and taste the cream

Hordes of disgust
Hungrs, hasty, roaming at night
Red eyes leering
Apparitions of the darkest kind
Heinous rodents
The past of the modern
agglomeration
Living terror
Indestructable abominations
Symptoms ofthe fulminant deseases
The number of infected ones
increases
Inimical towards the human race
Death in it's most efficient way
Ghastly creatures
Enticed by decayed filth
Abjective vectors
Crawling in fermenting dirt
Seat of infection
Wallowing in stinking slime
Malicious horror
Still unaffected by time
Spreading an awful and deadly
zymotic
Whole parts of mankind
contaminated
Bubonic plague, immortal enemy
Several populations attained
Verrucous corpses lie in the alley
Mephitic cadavers are rotting away
The livin covered with furuncles
Vermin, infesting another decade

All rise and come to order
Bailiff start the video recorder
You've been sworn, what's your
complaint?
Speak up son, don't hesitate!
He presided in his courtroom so long ago
He was hanging cowboys for stealing
buffalo
Court is adjourned, for his honor's
feeling ill
The shaking old relic needs a glycerin pill!
Hang up your rope 'cause you're
looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail
It's TV hell!
Chorus
Believe it or not
Those walking blood clots
Make enough money for a thousand
foot yacht
Who in Hollywood
Did they every acquit?
Just senile, judicial idiots
As the drama unfolds
And the law he upholds
If you look real close
You could see him growing mold
Small claims messiah
Is only a pariah to be ridiculed...
Objection Overruled!
All rise as he takes the bench
To hear his old voice make my
gut wrench
Silence to those who are in his court
I'm found guilty by his report
No washed-up judge can say to me
The shit he throws arround when
he's on TV
What can he fucking do, throw me in jail?
I'd slap out his dentures, post them
for bail!
Hang up your robe 'cause you're
looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail, it's TV hell!
Chorus
You lose the case
To a bigger bullshit they you today
When it comes to the end
You tell all of TV land what you've
got to say
When you're dead and gone
Will they get another fossil to carry on?
They must go to school
To hand-pick these old fools
I say to you
Objection Overruled!
It's all Perry Mason's fault!
Cat strangling

"...In a December Night Cold and Calm
At the Cliff of a Mountain Clad in Snow
I Gazed into the Skies then Closed by Eyes
For I Beheld the Ravendusk in my Heart..."

[Spoken Intro]
Feeling insane.
You don't know if you are dreaming or awake.
You feel certain that something is coming for you but you just can't be sure.
Last night's happenings seem so unrealistic and yet so true.
You just can't believe in your better future...
not even if it's always gonna be a new day after the dark.
You feel they are following you, you have to run you have to hide
The night feels just too freaky, hard to survive without a guide
"I am the peace of hangman, so winter won't be crying"
You can not see them moving, they fool your mind, blind your eye
No more trying, no denying, let them win and take your life
You can be hard on the still of the night
After the dark comes the light!
Open your eyes and see the light
After the dark comes the light!
Try to remember all the shining moments
New day is rising and you know
After the dark comes the light!
Next day you hope you 're dreaming, nightmares just teasing you
But it's the time to face it, there is just too much to do
"I am the peace of hangman, so winter won`t be crying"
It's written inside your head, they don't care what you need

I woke up, the dawn never came
Colder than yesterday it feels to me
We are coming home, we are young no more
Innocent as before playing our games
Call it a dream or an ideal
It's gone anyway
And the banners of the nations...
Today
They will march no more
The flags in line
They march no more
Today
Daydreams turned into grief
And disbelief
I see all the faces in the crowd
No more looking so proud or glorious
Our illusions are forever gone
And many deeds are done that can't be reversed

And in the presence of that evening
charged with meaning and with stars
I opened for the first time to the tender indifference of the world
as if my great anger had purged me of all evil
emptied me of everything of hope in finding it so like me
beyond control and ability so fraternal and in the presence of that evening
charged with meaning and with stars I opened for the first time
to the tender indifference of the world
I withheld beauty so that all would be complete
so that I could whisper a new song and fell less alone
I gave up my insides and the only things left for me to hope
for there will be many smiling people
looking on the day of my execution
and that they would welcome me with
cries of hate as if my great anger had purged me of all evil
emptied me of everything of hope welcome me with cries of hate

It's the time of the day when I lay down to rest
To impressions of the day digest
But thoughts of my existence emerge
Who am I and why am I?
My consciousness can't be purged
Until a soothing breeze is putting me to sleep
I fall through endless depths
My dreams awake, they're taking over
Take me on a journey within
[Lead: Schalin]
I see myself and I see my world
I meet people from my past
But can't remember where they're from
They stare at me with hollow eyes
Still disappointment therein lies
I see nations birth and death
One thousand human lives
Begin and end
I see new religions are born
And they fall into oblivio
I witness the births of worlds
And the old ones wither away
New universes are created in storms of fire
The old ones are crushed inside black holes
I see my old life fading away
And a new one is about to begin
I see water sprig
From the well of truth
People congregate
With will to eternal wisdom obtain
Those with false hearts
That taste the water change form
To trembling vile creatures with their insides out
The others are reborn as gods
At the very back of the swarming crowds
I see my tense face, I'm eager with fear
I desire to know but I fear the same fate
The one of others that I just beheld
When monsters with false hearts have expired
And the new gods are sent to conquer the world
As the last one I stand alone by the well
With fear I put out my hands
To finally taste the truth about me
[Lead: Schalin]
With uncertainty I awake from my dream
What would have happened and who am I?
I seek but can not find the well of truth
And struggle therefore through my life
With fear and eagerness
To godhood or complete demise

WE smoke the toenails and hair of the wiseman under a BLACKGOD's thumb we dance like painted puppets we eat the wiseman's eyes she bleeds orgasm in techni-color an ocean of alien mystery for sight that we might the lights fast enough see the darkness if we kill we burn the dry shell, a funeral chant that our eyes can open wide enough the pulse quickens and we dance we eat the brain and pray this celebration of old skin a scattering of dust to the winds as the blossoms fall screaming to consume you I feel every flower that is the earth and sky your cradle so is the way of forever the earth and sky entomb you beatings in cold rooms teeming with simple cruelties hands and head not found

My tongue has grown heavy, with the things I cannot say
Lost in this world of blue, black, and grey, I've tasted hell, as it came for me
Should I live or die, I can't decide, contemplating my life, as I think about the end
Should I take it all away from myself, saving me from all this pain and decit
My heart will fall from the sky and shatter on the ground,
shards of blood will pour out, into this letter
Should I live or die, I can't decide, contemplating my life, should I end it all myself
Taking it all away from me, and save myself from this bitterness and pain
My heart will fall from the sky and shatter on the ground,
shards of blood will pour out, into this letter,
that I leave behind telling the reasons why I chose
To hide, hide in death, wrap myself up in this darkness and cold
There's no turning back, holding your breath, waving goodbye
There's no turning back, holding your breath, waving goodbye again

Visions from the altar
Ripping through your soul
Seeing through the master's eyes
Young flesh the goal
Brutal rampage
Destroy the house of Christ
Obey your master
Another victim violently dies
Head torn off
A trophy raised to the sky
Bloody priest
Dies in pain
Stomach chewed open
Lying on the grave
As you bathe in the piss
Your master rains upon your face
Hear the calling from the abyss
Pagan destroyer crushes your race

Songs to sing
Song of Turtle
And the Cry of the Bear
Awake
I can sense it
Still I'm afraid
Tower Road lies ahead
Commala-come-ka
Ka has come to me
Grey old fellow
If you finally failed the test
What would it mean?
We're getting near
We're getting near
Maid of sorrow
Your time goes by
Fade away
Fade
"Say thank, ya" for the beams are safe my friend
Long days and pleasant nights for you
Save me
The final chord
Don't let it end like this
No, not like this
Tell me
When things were finally getting out of hand
It's out of hand
Entangled, I am captured
You have put a spell on me
The last in line
The Gunslinger's line
The sacrifice of innocence
This work needs to be done
Now blow the horn
Hail to the gun!
Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
Every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach, out of control
Save me
To touch the rose it will not bring release
No taking back
Come save me
There are other worlds
But surely none like this
The world has changed
Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
The word is the law
Law is Ka
The end of the road lies
Straight ahead it lies
I'm feeling pure
The end of the road lies
The sacrifice of innocence
The hailing of the gun
My way was death and madness
Now let the tower come
Done is done
Yes, there will be no taking back
And every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach, out of control

Let me tell you about the loss of all
the failing of all that we hold dear
Wrapped up nicely in ourselves
Chaos resolves
that which order defiles
Worthless lives
are ordered blind
I don't believe
Taste and you will see
that all belongs to me
I don't believe
I won't believe
I raise my hand against it all
for those who don't recognize the call
Will the sense to overcome these nestled walls
Going to break it down
Let me nail you to the treason wall
stab the night and the day from your sight
And set the thought to flame
Feeble devout
nothing resides
Break it to pieces
that obstinate mind
I raise my fist to hold the line
Against those who set themselves on high
Going to break it down

Awaken ruinous fiend of early generations.
Your rotting corpse is restored.
Straighten your limbs brush off the dust withered bandages restrain you no more.
Severed heads accent the gates bones emerge from the sands proof of your reign remains.
I your liege now command your rule again.
The sun burns through the skin boiling your vital organs within.
But the gods can't destroy my cursed blackened heart.
Appeasing the thirst of the damned mocking the praised ones.
The sand soaks the blood the blood flows like wine send death from above.
Locusts and famine engulfing your race my savagery knows no end.
At the price of all your lives I destroy your kind death by my hand.
Sands blowing across cursed lands will consume the evidence of your ancient existence.
The Earth is now black from the torment I have set upon it.
All shall bow serve and praise thy name.

A beast spawned from a deadly lineage
Maiming impulses descend
Instilling urges to mutilate
Tiny brain only programs rage
Horrendous jaws bite down on your wetting crotch
Unrestrained chompers bite clean to the bone
Lips curl back to reveal a pitbull grin
You run to escape the impending slaughtercide
Unfortunately you won't get far at all
Brutish jaws locking down, never let go
With a rabid instinct it viciously shakes you apart
Fierce teeth flash as it furiously growls
Soon you will feel the agony of its piercing jowls
Easily it rips out your soft, fleshy throat
It bites your naked face and goes berserk
Bones break friend is a canine nightmare
Blood lust is the nature of this beast
It only knows its own intercine ways
Torn and biting like a human chew-toy
Lips quivering, curling back, revealing a pitbull grin
It relentlessly pounces with inhuman aggression
Tooth and nail gouge making you a masticated mess
The dog backs away as you lay and die
It can now take its time to play
Your terminal distress is the pitbull's amusement
It possess a very sick sense of humor
But before you endure any more pain at the teeth of the animal
Your luck comes in as your bloodless heart stops
Your punctured eyes take in one last fanging sight
The threatening attack of a snarling, toothy muzzle
As lips curl back revealing a pitbull grin
You run to escape the impending slaughtercide
Unfortunately you won't get far at all
Brutish jaws lock down, never let go
As lips curl back revealing a pitbull grin

Override the overture
Behold the overwhelming power
Trampled and mangled
By the hordes of terror
The process of death is our fate to be
From the skies blood drips like rain
Tell me how I suffer, tell me how I'll die
My arms stretched out in eternal pain
The life that we knew drowned in the stream of death
The agony within tears my worthless being
Crushed
By the blasphemous horror inside
Enter a world
Beyond this global tomb
Mezmerized
By visions of things past and gone
My death arrives
My fate to be it must be done
Laid to rest
Shut my eyes
Live no more
Die a countless times
To the burial ground
Our flesh are bound
Our souls will live on
With the powers beyond
At the end
I'm still so cold inside
Once again
I would like to share my memories of life
Show me
The realm where nothing dies
If such a place exist
Please guide my eyes

Avatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess - my eternal mistress
I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I - her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One
I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress, it is real!
Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red - hot firmament (of golden darkenings of heavens)
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
'Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now, here and now

Amidst a swirling din of smoke
And screaming on the battlefield born
Reared on the teat of my dear mother war
Hardened to stone through abuse
Mocked, beaten and scorned
A bayonet severed umbilical cord
The wind sings its sad lullaby
Through a blackened and hollow ribcage
I'm to die in battle divine
With the flames as my grave
This realm of inhuman carnage
Where the blood eternally rains
To my brothers who've fallen before me
I will walk with you again
This my demented playground
The horizon is howling ablaze
The skeletal village illuminates the sky
As fire destroys their grains
With glee I rape and torture
My pleasure is inflicting pain
With a vigor unholy, I'll fight to my doom
'Til I've vanquished the Christian God's ways
Sure it must be such a different world
To which those on the outside exist
At least I know who loves me here
No delusions, all weakness dismissed
This era of inhuman tragedy
To be ushered by my iron hand
The ovens bellowed to crematory highs
To dispose of the God-fearing man
The wind sings its sad lullaby
Through a blackened and hollow ribcage
I'm to die in battle divine
With the flames as my grave
This realm of inhuman carnage
Where the blood eternally rains
To my brothers who've fallen before me
I will walk with you again

For you the life of temptation
Temptations so wild
With the suffers hold my glad
Treasures blood will raped by so lies
So natural so wild, get its the silent sun
Resurrection run the beautiful world
Now want to cut a world to win
The beautiful world, ya, how we must to grasp you

I lost 6 of my years
Fighting fire with fear
And it's tearing me apart inside
I can point all the blame
Try to relive the shame
But I think it's time I took back my life
'Cause I'm sick of the person I used to be
So stressed out, burned out, living in my agony
Hated all the words that they said to me
So I jacked up, blacked out, wasted all those memories
I won't go back
I won't go back
I won't go back
'Cause I'm sick of you
I'm sick of me
I'm sick of the person I used to be
What a pointless mistake
Such a slap in the face
Gotta turn this thing around again
No more holding it back
No more bending the facts
I'll push myself, push myself
'Till I understand
'Cause I'm sick of the person I used to be
So stressed out, burned out, living in my agony
Hated all the words that they said to me
So I jacked up, blacked out, wasted all those memories
I won't go back
I won't go back
I won't go back
'Cause I'm sick of you
I'm sick of me
I'm sick of the person I used to be
Save me from the tragedy
All the memories gone bad
Save me from the legacy
From my history
Just save me from my broken past
Just save me from my broken past
'Cause I'm sick of the person I used to be
So stressed out, burned out, living in my agony
Hated all the words that they said to me
So I jacked up, blacked out, wasted all those memories
I won't go back
I won't go back
I won't go back
'Cause I'm sick of you
I'm sick of me
I'm sick of the person I used to be

It's buried deep within the past and I
Hope it doesn't last
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
I try to give it all away, but it's never going to fade
(It's something I don't want to face, I don't want to face)
I know you feel it's all the same
But I promise that I'll change
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
You know I'm trying to believe
That you're never going to leave
(It's something I don't want to face, I don't want to face)
There's nothing left
The fear is gone
[Chorus]
And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
I know I'm not the perfect one
And this pain has just begun
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
You bring me to a better path
And it's everything I lack
(It's something I don't want to face, I don't want to face)
[Chorus]
If you fade out without me
Will you know all about me?
If you fade out without me
Will you know all?
[Chorus]

The saving shelter I want to achieve This last drop of blood running down my knees I see
the path of endless passion No estimation for my determination This is ... what i would kill
for This is what I want to carry in my heart This is what i stride for - my strength and
truth You have betrayed your own existence Focused on broken dreams that ll burn you
soul This is ...What i would kill for! This music has give us the most important experiences
in our lives. The importance of what this means to us can never be described by words.
Everyone who just stood on a stage for a single second knows what we mean. This is
something that we don't want to miss, this is our life and this is our destiny!

"Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shouldst not grave pleasures be my all?
For if I shall see thy Will be done
Grant Me the Witchcraft of thy tongue"
Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from eaves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth
Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled
Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
(As the moon's in narrow windows caught)
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon
Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong...
To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
'Neath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared
Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin
In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again
As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds
Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined...
Resplendent
In pendants
(Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns)
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ
"If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief"
As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain
And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.
On the twisted nails of faith.

Live to disrupt,
I live to destroy
As I target the boiling point so few employ
Silence is deadly so pin back your ears
Cause the axis has shifted
It has been so for years
Initiate, the kill chain
Deviate, my life's terrain
Terminate, by kill chain
The soul is the ground that the angels bleed for
If we are inciting war again we've got to stay strong
If we are deciding war again we've got to be strong
We are here, and it's no mistake
We've got to burn this ground, it's time to detonate
Save your fears because their is no escape
And we won't be long
So far enraged
Victim found, fixed, engaged
On this life's simple call
I'm a target to all
This battle is made
With the micro management
Of serpents for all
We don't rise just to fall
Initiate, the kill chain
Deviate, my life's terrain
Terminate, via kill chain
The soul is the ground that the angels bleed
If we are inciting war again we've got to stay strong
If we are deciding war again we've got to be strong
We are here, and it's no mistake
We've got to burn this ground, it's time to detonate
Save your fears because their is no escape
And we won't be long
And we won't be long

On the fields of desolation
We are all alone
Crying in each others arms
In fear of the unknown
Feelings of uncertainty
We are all doomed
To live in solitude
And never ending gloom
On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination
Why don't you cover me
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where the end begins
In times of grief and sadness
We're searching for the light
Seek for a place of safety
Seek for a place to hide
God turned his back on man
In divine resignation
Torn between two believes
Eternal life or termination?
As we drown in darkness
Weak and depraved
On our final journey
Too late to be saved
We've gone through places
Where the cold wind blows
Is this the end of it all
I don't know, I don't know

Pretenders to the throne kneel before him
Appalling wretched demon king
Praise be to us his children
Spawns of evils reckoning
Doomed from the inception
Claiming fire as our home
Licked by flames our steel grows stronger
To be forged in hate forevermore
A hellish scorn quickly approaches violent climax
Infernal legions, the time nears when we'll strike
The shadows serving to enshroud us our blackened hearts
Those forgotten looming just beyond their sight
The blood of pariahs through our veins
Sin and Hell our mainstay, forever to remain
Oh to ye wicked ones and oh to blood a reaper's song
Demons born of mans sickest desire
Those of the darkness spawned
Fires of Hell I stoke thee high
Through the open gates ever so wide, bury me in sin
The daggers have been raised, now let's begin
The margins of sanity blur into night
As one will move beyond the light
Murder effortlessly without a tear
Our motives to them never clear
Damn this liars world, we are the truth you've all awaited
Impaling holy fallacy, the filthy blood of Christian seed
Akin to the looming serpent, we've patiently anticipated
The time to rise is upon us
My lord, I kneel before you, now paint me bloody red
Bathing in blasphemy, I beat the path that's traveled less
The forgotten, your minions, our souls of black
We are thousands in the darkness waiting to attack
Infernal legions, their heads shall be your prize
Trophies to our dominions of conquests only fantasized
Oh to ye wicked ones and oh to blood a reapers song
Demons born of mans sickest desire
Those of the darkness spawned
Fires of Hell I stoke thee high
Through the open gates ever so wide
Bury me in sin, the daggers have been raised
Oh the dance of death, she's a sweet one
To our victory we will drink

Fire surrounds, searing flames lick, skin and hair bum,
human flesh burning sweet, now sauteed meat, cooked alive
Die by fire, painful death,
Flames ignite your flammable breath
Intense heat sears your soul,
Body reduced to blackened charcoal,
The bowels of hell aren't this hot,
Cremation does away with rot,
Tissues melt into burning muck,
Incinerated...
Head deep fries, broiling brain and eyes,
Skull a pressure cooker, exploding fireball,
Muscle and flesh now creosote fused to the bone
[repeat chorus]
Bones and teeth nothing but ash,
Dental identification gone in a flash,
Grilled, burnt and black as you burn,
Cremated, you now belong in a urn
Organs to cinders, internal gasses ignite,
Combusting within, singing inestines gristled stiff,
Fat burns like crisco napalm, burning globs,
Smoldering cadaver, the end result a putrid pyre,
[repeat chorus]
[MUSIC: BROKEN HOPE]
[LYRICS: J.WAGNER]

Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
We brought the battle, we saw the signs,
We've found ourselves two steps behind.
I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.
(pray for drought)
This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse.
This is colony collapse.
Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose.
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold.
We were warned but we wouldn't be told.
I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.
This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true.
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. This is colony collapse.
Colony collapse.
Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true.
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?
This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true.
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse.
This is colony collapse.

A story is told, of a demon like man
Way back in the dark, a forsaken land
Taker of souls into the depths of hell
Taker of souls on earth he dwells
Taker of souls can you hear the cries
Taker of souls why do they have to die
A legend tells, of the vicious beast
Attacking the land, killing the weak
Hacking, slashing they fought the beast
Bodies lie scattered slaughtered sheep
Take on this creature, may be too strong
Fate of the village, destiny's born
Ooooh destroy the beast
Ooooh destroy the beast
Fought like true soldiers, for family and god
Losing no option, carry on
Women and children lives are at stake
With blood and sweat they died that day
Ooooh destroy the beast
Ooooh destroy the beast
Destroy the beast...
He'll take your soul, to hell, to hold
You'll never, be free again his servant until life's end
Can't fight this unholy force
In hell, life takes it's course
In hell, life takes it's course

Freak of unthinkable proportions
Perfect candidate for abortion
Future double-suicide from shotgun blast
Rectally twins-and joined at the ass
Some things deserve to die
Severed siblings with a surgical knife
Buildup of waste at articulation
Installed colostomy for shit irrigation
Purchased for science and mutant research
Human guinea pig
Waste not, want not
How can there be a god
That brings atrocities to its creation
Born into hell-mandatory torment
Biologically malformed, existance is futile
We bring disease
And physiological agony
Nobody ever said that life was easy

Your mind to infinity
Let reason rivet on your feet or you may fall
You're drawn into a distant glow
You dream of voices from on high
But can't evade another rainy night
And putting on another show
Hate and affection
Pleasure and pain
Modes of vibration
Unveiling to be all the same
And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
And when you face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter
Failure and defeat and all the riches surely beat
Where I have been and what I have been before
And when the sands of time run low
Commemoration of a lonely crow
That would have made it through the door
Light and affection
Darkness and pain
Mind of matter
The all's gonna make it all the same

Eternal flames won't cleanse my soul
Racing through me, burning me
Unpure I'll shine forever
Wild darkness boils in my veins so tired
Through the red
With fires of dawn burning in my eyes
Through the red
Burning me
All faces turn black
I refuse to breathe
Cleanse me

Just one kiss from me
Is all you need
Just one taste can change your life
Or everything
You hoped and dreamed
My bloodlust cause will take your life
Some day
You won't be so afraid
To stay inside
You won't be so afraid
To cover-dark your hole
Forever
My me my me my
My little lover
My me my me my
My little lover
Yeah
So close your eyes
Worlds away
Goodnight Kiss
You never miss a light
Drained of your fear
it drains us nearer
Bloodlust wakes
Gonna take the night
You're dying
Slowly
Solely
For me
You're lying
lonely
Your soul is
For me
You're
My me my me my
My little lover
My me my me my
My little lover
Yeah
Crawl with me
Crawl with me
Be my
My little lover
x2
My me my me my
My little lover
My me my me my
My little lover
Yeah
Crawl with me
hey
Crawl with me
hey
You know you're
My me my me my
My little lover
You're dying
slowly
Stole your soul away

"Last words of my dear brother...
Seek your origin in the mithril mountain
All answers shall be revealed...
And take care of the ones back home
Before it's too late...
We'll meet again in lands beyond this world
We shall walk the silver fields again..."
[Solo: E.H]

Here in her arms
on my own
in the shine of delusions
The calling illusion
takes my thoughts
and my feel
On the rise of this coil
of growing depression
this coil is boring
the air is so deep
full of dead hopes
The calling illusion
takes my thoughts
and my feel
I fly this breeze, the night
The night now seems to be eternal
this coil of thoughts
steals my breath
as the illusion seems to be real
Follow me
on this coil
of growing depression
follow me
over this wind
the gate of suicide
the breeze of all lies
Over the clouds
higher than wind
illusion brings me
on the higher side
I'm so high embraced in her wings
I feel like who might
dare to leave

when i was young
i questioned my faith
at a time when i was searching
and now i look back
when i'm down
whenever i hurt
think of Christ and I think of the Cross
just when i thought the walls were closing in
in came the trap
think and react
never again will i turn my back
never again will i question my faith
hold on tight and close my eyes and pray will every beat of my heart
never think twice
hold up my cross
never again will i deny my faith
i break down
i am alone
stick right by
every word of the Book
when i forgive what they've done
won't have no more questions to ask
with Him close to my heart
live my life
with no regrets
just when I thought the walls were closing in
in came the trap
think and react
never again will i turn my back
never again will i deny my faith

Have you ever thought
Where your soul will be
When you'll lie to rot
Die physically
Being so fascinated
By those mysteries
I've began some weird
Out of my body
I saw a light
In front of me
It blinked my eyes
Invited me in
Forever will shine
This tremendous light that drives me blind
When I got behind
Control was no longer mine
Meeting those who dies
Those who've been here before I arrived
I should have stayed behind
Only incarnation can now bring me back
To mankind

A veil of mist, a foreign coast
The calm before their battle cry
Steel drawn, the line of shields must hold
Through mist, the first arrow, it flies
Battle, hold firm the line in battle
Shoulder by shoulder, brothers at side
We may stand victorious or fall
This fine day, a fine day to die
We shall fight and may die by the sword
Cutting through flesh and bone, your sword
My brother, our father taught you well
But from behind the unseen blow
Mortally wounded, down you tell
Battle, hold firm the line in battle
Shoulder by shoulder, brothers at side
Silent by my side you did fall
This was a fine day a fine day to die
Brother, I'll keep your broken sword

You put a gun to my head
The storm's too deep, outlook dead
Handing down that anger
Nothing good ever lasts
Moody violence, now a fool in my eyes
What's the answer, I'll search till I die
Try a little harder, I hear myself say
Make it last before it's taken away
Wading through the darkness
My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Forced to forget this anguish
I'm half of what I used to be
Erase my memory, now gone forever, goodbye
But I know my memories won't die
Wading through the darkness
My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Dead inside with a heart that bleeds
Relax, my tension needs, tightness suffocates
No longer churning inside, rotted memories inhabit my mind
My rage destroys the calm, destroys the calm
Wading through the darkness
My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Wading through the darkness
Wading through the darkness
Wading through the

Dear Sam,
I'm sorry I pushed you away from everything we had, even me.
I couldn't ask you to wait forever.
But that doesn't mean that my feelings have changed,
everyday your face is clearer.
Regret is the burden I'll carry from here to my grave.
This distance is the knife in my heart.
Let him know the treasure he has.
Don't let him make my mistakes.
Forever is never too long to wait for something perfect,
I'll be here.
Love always.

As the northwind starts to whisper
I open my encrusted eyes
And walk into the beyiond
To the land of the thousand skies
As my life slowly fades away
I see the end of this mistery
Now I finally realize
That I can't stay alive
Take me down
Where the sweet becomes the bitter
Take me down
Where the truth is a lie
Take me down
Where hope rots awy
Take me down... into the beyond
Tears are falling free
In a neverending stream
Dark signs of the night
The fallen night
... open my eyes... and see
My soul is forlorn
In the cold winds of darkness
And I will never find peace
In my restless heart

Nobody else can see you the same way as myself
Fly high and touch the sky, you're the angel I adore
If only you could feel for me that I feel for you
Why do you ignore me, angel, why can't I go with you
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
The more love I feel for you, the more you fade away
Why can't you come and love me, do I have to stay this way
I'm going to go insane if nothing happens soon
I look out at the night to see your shadow by the moon
You're an angel witch, you're angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're angel witch
Walk through the forest I can feel that you're there
Why do you run away?
I'd never hurt you, I'd never hurt you
That's the last thing I'd do
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch

Pyosis mucolysifies malignant mucocoeles
Pustules endocrinating disseminated mortified cells
Flesh punctuated by cancerous pustules
Burning your face with formicating papules
Mucopurulence excretor
Mucopurulent organs digested in sepsis
Mucolysifying, rancidifying as you eat your own cysts
Putrefying your pyorrhoea - infested corpse excretes away
Expelling pyuria and septic goitrous membrane

you will see
my burning inferno
and there is no way
in your wildest dreams
that you can say no
i suffocate your soul
and drain you of your lifeblood
the breathing darkness here
will make you disappear
there is no return
i steal your soul
and carve a hole right where your heart once used to be
i watch you die
i hear you cry
it fills my soul with such delight
you are lost
you are entering a dead world
wherever you will turn
you will see your spirit burn
your life is over
here in death's dominion
where even shadows die
i am the one almighty
you will cry my name
and when you seek forgiveness
you will see there is no god
and for all eternity
you will cry my name
you
cry out
now it's time to return
to the world up above
and invite you to burn
oh, the ones that i seek
are defenseless and weak
soon their hearts will be mine
and no one can slip
from my powerful grip
i was born to deceive
the smell of your flesh
so rancid and fresh
it keeps me alive

A rumble in distance mechanical whine
So our lights can shine scrape off the epidermis
Robbing pillars equivalent to graves
Tear down the walls faces ripped from their jaws
Black damp inhalers
We incarcerate ourselves in clay filled veins
The hollow drain which echoes our pain
Their is no sweeter sound
Than the song of a dead canary
Sin remover
Burn away slag
We bare silicosis the fruits of our perseverance
Bleeder entries are packed with intestines
Holds back the dream till it discharges like a gun
Sin remover
Sin remover
I am the Zion
I am the Zion
I am the Zion
Extract our blood
We bleed of black reclamation
Shapes the face to a graven image
See the lies, we mend our seams
As days go by
On wounded knees I see you pray for me

Moonlight rays awaken me
From my eternal sleep
I am not alive, but I still breathe
I ask myself, "how can this be"?
The feeling inside, is hard to describe
I feel strong but yet so weak
I walk into the night, with a hunger so strong
Something to eat I seek
"Pulses quicken, piqued by the scent of blood"
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!
That's when I realise, I've become one of them
Cursed to live in darkness, never see the light of day
It's the birth of a vampiir - Strigoi!
It's the birth of a vampiir - Strigoi!
Moonlight rays awaken me
From my eternal sleep
I am not alive, but I still breathe
I ask myself, "how can this be"?
I've become one of them
Never see the light of day
It's the birth of a vampiir - Strigoi!
It's the birth of a vampiir - Strigoi!
"Cursed to live in darkness, never see the light of day"

Hold close the human in you
Cherish your freedom
Let nothing deny you
Your enemy hides from the truth
Clings to the darkness (cowers in the shadow)
You are the essence of proof
Positive vision of strength individual
Not paralyzed
Not compromised
In dreams reside the fate of man
Recognize those who'll destroy
Those who will suck from your hard work and struggle
To governments you're but a toy
Anonymous mules (on whose backs they ride freely)
Give not to Caesar his tithe
Instead care for yourself, your family, your pride
You're not categorized
Not number assigned
With dreams you provide for the hope of man
[Chorus]
Revealing all their darkest crimes
(Destroy the hush)
Exposing truth through the other side
(Destroy the hush)
With strength one day we will collide
(Destroy the hush)
And in so doing we will retrieve ourselves our lives
Destroy the hush!
Imagine a world free of fear
A world where your dreams can be real as envisioned
A world where you choose what to be
Not what they make you (a monitored slave)
Those dreams will soon disappear
If we don't progress and succeed in the stifling
Of government lies
Expose what they hide
And we will provide for the fate of man

I have died from within
The beginning of an end
But I still stand
Seeing red
The anger made me strong
The vision was mine
Horizon becomes vast
Claim your throne
The fire turns to flames
I had it all
Before the fall
Warlords of misanthropy
Powers
Spiritual powers to foresee
Warlords of misanthropy
Warriors of the fall
Through sinful years
The hellish burden
That I was given:

You finally have destroyed all the good in me.
Face to face, there's nothing left inside of me.
A soulless shell, I'm so incomplete.
This is the last time you will ever;
You will never lie to my face.
I have no love inside my heart.
Only a knife deep in my back.
This shell that I've become is all that's left of me.
Thanks to you. You have ignored our history.
You left us cold and hungry, surviving week to week.
This is the last time you will ever;
You will never lie to my face.
To destroy you woule be no great loss

The shaft of daylight melts dirty panes.
The stench of life pulls them out from their dreams.
Those living wastes on the streets outside.
Woken up again with no place to hide!
Daily food like shit and beer, and this taste is stronger than heroin!
I open cardboard to see (Waclaw Kieltyka - Guitar Solo)
As a river of shit pours over me.
The secretions of city mass machine.
Sewers running through my veins. (Witold Kieltyka - Drum Solo)
The shaft of daylight melts dirty panes.
The stench of life pulls them out from their dreams.
Those living wastes on the streets outside.
Woken up again with no place to...

These tire tracks
zigzag your torso like the devil's self portrait
the car accident, the skin graft treatment, the flower baskets, the wincing relatives
You bid her farewell then you got in your car
and that's the last thing that you can recall
and when they pulled you out, you didn't know your name, exploding semi truck blurred your face with flame
You met Jane four years ago today, dancing at some vomit stained frat party
her newspaper gown, her flashing headline brown, her violent gypsy dance, her tired underpants

Jane let you touch her and feel her and she was so free like a pineapple in a tree but
You said it's dangerous to be so intimate, you know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous
Jane said when she laid on her back the sun hit her body like an ugly landscape but
Some things never get better,
Like used cars and bad livers,
So you traded her in for a better looking brand
One with fake porno tits,
A padlock on her lips
A disposable tan
Biodegradable hands
And back at the hospital you got no visitors at all, but she visits you in your sleep, and that Newspaper gown is always on fire (x2)
She met him a week after you left her
When you tossed out her touch to the garbage collector.
He talked her out of her skirt in his beer-soaked apartment
And then they did all the things
You never said that you wanted.
And the sirens are laughing underneath your skull
And your thoughts are turning dull, callous and cold
Yesterday you gave your burden a name
Yesterday you gave your burden a face
And that burden, looks an awful lot like her

The time is now

Humanity

[chorus]
I'm immortal
wielder of steel a war machine

The One who will lead you
to victory
I'm the Hero

I'm Eternal

The sword the armour will be
my only brothers when i ride

And now the time has come for me
to rise my sword against all thee
and then the spell shall son
be cast
you're doomed to fall beneath
my axe
I'll banish evil from this land
a newborn king will overcome

Conquest is mine into the fight
Screaming the battlecry !

[IV) Death Of The Champion]
Oh,King of the dead
I've waited so long to fight by
your side
and my sacrifice to you are
souls of enemy knights
released by my sword
An arrow flies it bites my heart
the steel is cold
my blood spills out
I can't believe it runs out red
immortal heart can't feel no pain
For all these years i've lived a lie
the wisemen words blinded
my eyes
a son of gods,immortal lance
now just a son of mortal men
[V) Heroes In Tears]
Oh,the battle is near the end
My body lies on the blood stained
sand
All I hear are cries of pain
All I see are my friends before me
Heroes in tears [4 times]
[VI) Destiny Revealed]
Now my destiny is revealed
I'm a fate's soldier to eternal war
The gates of time will spread
open wide
Mortal in body,etrnal in will
Doomed to be called with
many names
Doomed to have many shapes
and doomed to be forever at war
and to go wherever I'm called
Where will i go ? TO FIGHT!
For what ? TO FIGHT!
To fight for what ? TO FIGHT!
For what ?
Eternal Champion doomed to fight
forever!
FOREVER!

Scarlet woman your eyes are in the mirror
where all vices of men can reflect down on Earth.
Scarlet as all the flames born in springtime,
as the female substance of your name: BABALON!
Your soul is red as blood by moonlight
your womb gives to unholy ghosts.
Your lotus provides us with the Elisir.
You're the sweet-smelling lady of darkness
and receive the Sun's strenght through the red doors of lust.
Like a Phoenix reborn from the ashes
you scan time to prepare for the advent of the Beast.
I drink your nectar filled with magic
'cause I will change it into life.
Your sex to me is the source of every will.
Ride the Beast, sweet whore of Hell
and turn my pain into Heaven.
Suck my blood and tear my soul.
Let the night set ablaze our love!
You're the adulteressm the lady of changes,
you're the virgin, the mother, the lady of spell.
Oh my magical, mystical woman
give me victory and life with your juice of the moon.
I drink your nectar filled with magic
'cause I will change it into life.
Your sex to me is the source of every will.
Ride the Beast, sweet whore of Hell
and turn my pain into Heaven.
Suck my blood and tear my soul.
Let the night set ablaze our love!

Mawkish vulture undigniflies
Call him uncle and he will rise
From the newsstand mediate crapitation
Face me down
Death your crown
Bring your waffle and raffle
Fair fair
Glaring darkness fraught with strife
And we jokingly call it life
Brutalized like demigods dissalvation
Face me down
Death your crown
Bring your waffle and raffle
Fair fair

He Moa Kane (ancient Hawaiian riddle)
Above is red -- below is red
Hear the ringing voice...
A strutting rooster

From long forgotten eons,
At sunrise thou shouldst come.
Desired for so fucking long.
Ascend at my command,
Surmount the sea,
Throw open portals of life;
And scale this endless mountain.
Of grace and of tears,
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard,
Abandoned heart so desolate!
Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne,
When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond.
When heavenly chants mute;
Thy apparition I behold.
Oh Venus, the sweetest of them all,
Let me bathe in thy divinity.
Descend! And Thou hast descended,
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth of blissful rays,
And fateless eyes encourage me.
The ancient's dreaming.
The wolf's unchained.
Disobedience has such a victorious taste!
Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne,
When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond.
Solo Nergal
(growls)
Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne,
When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond.
Forever abandoned among gods,
Since I have been made of flesh,
And yet I challenge Thee!
Canst thou hear my battle cry?

Dear tomorrow,
Find some sensibility,
Respond to emotion.
Dear Politician,
Define sagacity,
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they have chosen.
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they've selected.
Nobody stands behind the nation they've selected.
All chances of survival are beginning to diminish.
Comedy is no excuse for our own blasphemies.
Mass media
Mass pessimism
Mass Denial.
My television tells me to panic, but I don't think I'll listen.
The apathetic force us to persevere,
The apathetic, with their backwards priorities.
If only the strongest of stone was not necessary.
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they have chosen.
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they've selected.
Nobody stands behind the nation they've selected.
Liberation includes failure,
Your rebellion is resultless,
So be angry at yourself,
If only we did not deserve this.

Fairy tales of fire. More trials of strength and
Tribulations that mean life or death for us all here
You are boring me. Solutions not emotion. Emotion not
Declarations. I'm repeating nothing. I'm caring not
Save the tired cliche's for the already converted
Poetic licenses have been severely strained. Kill that
Albatross for it's not of truth. It speaks of eternal
Life without sacrifice. Kill that fucker there's no
Wrath to follow. It's godless and it's incoherent. And
It's still in the flesh. I can not see it one
Commitment linking revolving worlds. And that's all
You are, a politician. Too much grey stop it, there's
Too much. No cut and dry truth to be had. Black and
White's long been nonexistent, so I part my way. Kill
That fucker, there's no wrath to follow. It's godless
It's incoherent and it's in the flesh. Kill it. So
What is the point anyway? You do not give a fuck about
People and god takes care of his own. Let's drag them
Into the streets. Death to all carnivores and
Vivisectors, and don't stop there. don't stop with
Names like fag and nigger. By your own word we are all
Gods and everyone anyone might think undesirable
Deserves death. Sin doesn't exist anymore, we are
Merely animals. Kill the albatross for it's not of
Truth. It speaks of eternal life without sacrifice.
Kill that fucker there's no wrath to follow. It's
Godless and it's incoherent. And it's still in the
Flesh. I can not see it one commitment linking
Revolving worlds. So I part my way. She'll shake
Herself free of us soon enough and nothing will have
Mattered. He's coming a second time, one last time
Then it's just a matter of how long it will be before
We are considered a find. Another artifact in the dips
And rises of civilization. But still it has turned
Into a commodity and I listened to you. Every last one
And still I ate it all. I believed it all, now I just
Hate it all. I've never been so conceited to think
That our fate doesn't lie in god. So ask me again if I
Care. I'm not for sale but I'm still coming after you
And I am collecting.

Unliving eyes see death's subtle jest
In my sorrow they mourn the past
Yet celebrate their eternal rest
Relieving the worlds pain
In a church of misery
Dampening the lantern flame
Upon your bended knee
Painted skulls
Painted skulls
Warm and close the air runs hard
Around the loyal gravesite
Wailing moon in a putrid sky
Hungry and eager tonight
Our cries pierce their world
An invocation to mourn
Celebration, fete for fate
Of unearthly dead souls reborn
Like a slime trail of a slug
Transgress to the husk
Unburied souls in restful bliss
Bursting forth from crust
Stale the stench of arising souls
In ritual macabre
Drag you down infuse your mind
By blade or poisoned barb
Painted skulls
Painted skulls
The festival end now they sleep
Shrouds of pain another year
Return to their boneyard
We surviving ones await in fear
Mourning unsurpassed
To the bitter end
Broken dreams and broken lies
Painted skulls, the children cry

Creases in the depths of our existence
Without which, there can be no substance
These rifts and folds within our lives
Each day, a new disruption arrives
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make

From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane

Foul prayers rise
Staring through the eye of the chasm
Still at rest but breathing
Enemy be born
Grant us knowledge of the opposition
Spew forth from the earth
Contagious is the one from which the wisdom comes
So sworn
Hibernation draws to a close
Lacerating wings unfold
Hunger will cease
Abominations speak from the dark
Now seek only death
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now!
Face is the one of a reptile
Rotting teeth and lips
Speaking words of sick salvation
Whispering eclipse

As blood stains soil underneath the rejects of the light
Everything that stands shall burn in fear of the dark lord
In this rage of storm I hear the pouring drops of blood
Entrance to these shadows of the devil
Towers of light fall into this endless abyss
As monoliths of black arise
This fear now bleeds the storm, like flames engulfed in darkness
Passing days of despair restless in these hours of suffering
These sharps claws of death yearn for this warm crimson touch
Swarms rage as demon hordes rip forth from my chest
Warm red streams explode beneath my hands
Moments closer to death to be swallowed into black
Embrace this deception for birthright in self-pain
Reborn as a shadow in the black inside the fires of hell
The bloodlettings of suicide flood onto the cold dark inside the mind
Drowning in the soft flames of hell within this the scent of decay
A voice of fire from within the sleep of shadow
This place of weeping for the children of the light
I am absorbed in the drowning of fire inside the catacombs of hell
Enslaved by the scythe of Azrael with hallowed souls
The thirteen now await the black serpents, bringer of death
These children of the light lie silent in the dark
This sea of blood for joining in spirit descent
Shroud of ruin within this scourge of bloodshed
Rage in tainted blood that blinds all of the light
Entrance to this embrace inside deception
Elegies of lament for the thirteen children of the dark
Lying still, Satan opens the dark
I embrace deceit, whispers unto the dark
Voices fall silent as ghosts of their screams
Throbbing pulse of this becoming as the blade cuts through flesh
Echoing this haunting curse of cloven whispers
I am the depths of hell
I call out from the blood
Up from the darkness
I call out from hell
I am dead in this world
A flood of death in blood
Commanding this death that light has bled
Abyss is open within me
I purge this sea of blood
Symbolized in agony through this praise of the blade
Awakening the Impure as we drink their blood in the name of the dark
Where I am drowned by the blood of hell

How I'd love to experience a heartquake
But oh so afraid it will end up with a heartache
These untimely little deaths
Would leave me out of breath
Life would flash before my eyes
You might become a liability
And I a reliability
Still I'd know how it feels
The absence
Is highly present
It smothers me
Absorbs me like a black hole
The absence of longing
Fills up time and space
Tons and tons of emptiness
Weigh upon me
You're a bumpkin groping and falling
But you're my pumpkin prescious adoring
Wish for you to say it
First
Better to have failed in true love
Than never knowing what you long for
Better to feel pain
Than to feel nothing

There's nothing I can say
That hasn't already been said
I'm just repeating myself
Repeating someone else
Equally incapable of
Uttering a single new thought
Yet you are ever worthy of adoration
So how can I for a moment
Cease to lift my heart in praise?
Your name is Glory, my song is victory
And I will keep on singing
There is no opposition
No thing can stand in Your way
Make my life Your own

Loosing the war I'm feining to win
Though I never tried to to strive deep
From within. Life could be beautiful
For anybody it's for, but I'd swear this
Mothafuckin' shit is rotten to the core.
The portal has been past and it's
Time to make a turn, to follow the reaper
Until the point of no return.
When your blindly death-raying blade
Sweeps the griefs and fears away.
I cross my heart and hope to die thy freedom
Will be mine.
Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.
Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-reliefing potion.
But after all, that got boring too, so no matter
What happens, I couldn't give a damn or too.
The portal has been past 'til the
Point of no return. No more lines to cross,
No bridges to burn.
Now when your blindly death-raying blade
Swept my griefs and tears away. I'd never go back
To cross that line.
I cross my heart and hope to die.

I'm not dead or alive
My thoughts clouded pristine
A static web internecine
The cutting edge of a lie
Will only furrow the dream
Solders the soul together clean
The poison enters the veins
It's woven into the stream
My new casket is lined with screams
I'm not dead or alive
My thoughts clouded pristine
A static web internecine
The cutting edge of a lie
Will only furrow the dream
Solders the soul together clean
The poison enters the veins
It's woven into the stream
My new casket is lined with screams
I'm never going to die
Cause my world is built on lies
Burned it all
Watched it fall
No elation inside these walls
Breaking down again
Barricade forms within
Tearfully rejoicing
Finally the sun will see it's end
The poison enters the veins
It's woven into the stream
My new casket is lined with screams
Burned it all
Watched it fall
No elation inside these walls

The land was created, in the name of the chosen,
and the waves thrown, for men to see the one who made men to be.
Prevailed from the source of Icon E.
The waves of fury, prevailed from the source of Icon E.
Were mine to be ordered to destroy and bury.
No remorse!
The destiny of the wave, was not to be found.
Nor was I travelling the deadly sea alone.
The sun never rose and my rose was not to be.
For what purpose I gave my return is stil standing alone.
And as the raven dropped a feather on me.
I was again to be the chosen one...

Open your portals, infernal lord.
Oh, great opener of the way come forth hear my calls,
Blast ye forth through the gates unholy master
Spread your wings fly then high, into the blood red skies.
It's time to claim your rightful domain.
Send out your black winged horde, through the night.
Defend their lord, when angels strike.
Unholy war, thunder roar angels blood falls to the ground.
Satan lord, through the night he flies holding high
Their impaled Nazarene son covered in blood, and his
Jaws agape his eyes aglow with the fires of hate.
Satan lord, through the night he flies.
Holding high their impaled Nazarene son.
Covered in blood, and his jaws agape.
His eyes aglow with the fires of hate.
Once again, the dark age will rise worlds set aflame,
By your hellish hate no more feeble Christians ever
Will reign burned into eternal fire, in your darkened domain.

You thought it was over; it's not over
I'll be back; I brought my axe
In the shadows, alone in the dark
Young victims I stalk
You thought it was over; it's not over
I'll be back
From the grave
To mutilate
Axed in the back
Pick through the neck
Dead like the rest
Molested and left
Limbs split in half
I ruptured their flesh
Puncture wounds
To the head
Bone fragments clot to the hatchet
Knee-deep in the blood of the dead
Cranial separation
Sex with her severed head
Rotten walking dead
Hunting living victims

These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice
Hush?.
Don't tell them nothing, not a word
Hush?
Don't tell them nothing, not a single thing that I've said to you
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies!
Can you hear it scream?
Deep deep inside
Hush?
Now listen carefully, here it comes
Hush?
It's what I keep inside, this is the crime that I've tried to hide
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies!
Can you hear it scream?
Deep deep inside
Envy...Sloth...Gluttony...Wrath...Pride...Lust...Greed
These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice
These secrets I'll give to you
Will turn virtue to vice
These secrets I'll bring to you
(These secrets I'll bring to you)
Are of thorns and ice
(Are of thorns and ice)
These secrets I'll give to you
(These secrets I'll give to you)
Will turn virtue to vice
(Will turn virtue to vice!)
Can you hear it scream?
Deep deep inside
I'll tell you only once?

I can't complain I've made myself a name
And all I really want is five minutes of fame
Some material wealth and a life in good health
'cause all I really even care about is myself
I don't know a single thing about the situation
But why should I care about the next generation
I've got everything I need but I still want more
I can't understand why you complain 'cause you're poor
I don't feel sorry for you we've got he same possibilities
It's all about taking your own responsibility
I took mine so I deserve what I got
I've got my name on the wall of fame I'm going straight to the top
It cost me a lot of money but I took my degree
And that's the biggest difference between you and me
There's not a thing in the world that my money can't buy
I can't understand why you didn't even try
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
You can't blame me because you're underfed
You should be glad that you've got a roof over your head
If you worked for a living you could pay your rent
Instead of begging me for help when all your money's spent
You won't ever fool me because I know your type
I see you standing on the corner like a parasite
You're a loser and you know it but you don't even care
I can't understand why you say life ain't fair
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill
Pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay
Pay the bill
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't complain
I've done everything I can but it's still the same
I've got nothing to lose so why should I give a fuck
My life's a piece of shit and that's where I'm stuck
I never got a fair chance to even prove myself
So tell me why should I be nice to anybody else
You say you can't understand why I say life is a bitch
So what do you mean we've got the same possibilities
I haven't even got your educational abilities
I dropped out of school before I took my degree
'cause the welfare line made more sense to me
I try to work for a living so I can play all my debts
And I've come to realize this is as good as it gets
I hate my fucking life more than you hate me
I just can't understand why this is how it should be
So I complain it's still the same, we're standing still
While the next generation has to pay the bill
So I complain it's still the same, we're standing still
While the next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill
Pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill
Pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay

Night swells to distant spheres
Silent throat of unholy times
The withering wind deep down here
Flesh of the gods bleeding as light
Here in the environs of heaven
The am sun am out-shined one
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony
Forever people suffer in silence
Always and forever drifting to dark waters
The sand of time, still ominous
As sculptured cherubs of the ether
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony
"The am sun, my ebony sun"
Erratic firmament and the perishing clouds
Descending angels, formless divine
To inherit light and silence, so profound
The devilish eyes of the reptile
Here in the environs of heaven
The am sun am out-shined one
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony

They'll promise you your future
In their hands you'll succeed
Believe in every word they speak
More contributions to their greed
Service for the fools
Preach and you will listen
Follow God without Breaking the rules
Look at all the lives
So taken by religion
Now initiated
Circus of Fools
All you really believe in
Is how much you can scam
It's all about donations
To the loving preacher man
He's always there for you
Sunday morning's PTL
Well if Heaven is like this
I'd rather go to Hell
I'll make you holy
Just give me more
Time is what I need
To get into your brain
Filled with lies so profound

We cannot wait for another day
When all is lost without you
I'll find a way as it manifests, showing us another way
Everything sets it off including you
Breaking down what is left fighting through
Forever sadness that you gave me
I'll keep it with thoughts of you
Facing your biggest fear tonight
Losing your best friend tonight
It will happen to you in due time
You never stopped to shed one drop of blood for me
One drop for me

The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die
I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt
Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their steaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me
Makes me feel so good
They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes
Each man has something that I crave
I ate their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Odin's feet in afterlife
I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine
A sacrificial ritual
One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Odin's birds
I am a wolf in human shape
I am a predator with flaming rage
I'm a wolf in human shape
Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage
Blood is in my trace
I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Odin calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door

A rollercoaster ride to a (cold) place of death
The utmost self-searching journey
And I can feel it in the air
Everything is turned upside down and inside out
The chaotic, strangled inner glow
From dead, empty lifeless eyes
Snot, tears and fucking misery
Dodens kolde satans guf's
C jennom marg og bein. Feber I en dypf'ryst s jel
Fra fleinsoppens og helvetes k jetting - lenker
"et langt skritt til himmelen
et lite steg fra helvete"
My darkest thoughts haunt me
(and) I am trying to hide
but I don't know how
twisting like a fucking worm
I see the soul in your eyes
I see through you...
Distrubing flashbacks
A rusty machine in a mechanical void

Truly they lie, they talk utter nonsense
Who say that music reckon that the kantele
Was fashioned by a god
Out of a great pike's shoulders
From a water-dog's hooked bones
It was made from the grief
Molded from sorrow
Its belly out of hard days
Its soundboard from endless woes
Its strings gathered from torments
And its pegs from other ills
So it will not play, will not rejoice at all
Music will not play to please
Give off the right sort of joy
For it was fashioned from cares
Molded from sorrow

evolutions been kind to you
your indeed a bright baboon
howl, moan, and forage for food
under a blood red moon
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
and no one will harm you anymore
you know how much i'd hate to kill you
so has life been kind to you
or do you feel a bit subdued
is your mind for once at ease
are you everything you hoped to be
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
shut up, shut updon't make a sound
we don't wantto have to put you in the ground
CANNIBALS AND CARNIVORES
i'll hang these antlers proudly
my freezer's full of meat
i've down right stumbled on to
the deal of the century
crack a tin of wheat and barley
and now my stomachs full
plenty of porno to cock and bull
mother nature bends you over
then it's over, yes it's over
walking upright with composure
mother nature bends you over
i hold my head up high
from a reclined position
absorb magnetic waves
from a big screen television
feed my x-rated eyes with sweet perverted play
i'm simply passing time all night and everyday
mother nature bends you over
then it's over, yes it's over
walking upright with composure
mother nature bends you over
flooded town will keep you sober
as mother nature bends you over
a cataclysm overturning
resume position, now you're learning
evolutions been kind to you
you're at home in a warm cocoon
submissive and immune
under a blood red moon
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
and no one will harm you anymore
you know how much i'd hate to kill you

This might be the last time you ever see me
But you can trust I did my best
As complex as all this seems
It's much more than a test
The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears
As my world is dying
So far from home
Been stranded in this empty abyss
Darkness surrounds me
Lifeless
The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears
Existence
Search for a new beginning
Persistent
Something always chasing me
This demon's covered in scars
Menacing
Burnt by the sun his flesh is charred
Challenging, Terrorizing, Manipulating every single thought
As he closes in
My will must be strong
Or he'll stab you in the fucking back
I won't turn to dust
The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears

Falling into your demise
Reaping death across their eyes
Born as a freak in a killing breath
Ignorance prevails, breeding death
A dream contorted, a victim of death
Throughout reality devoid of breath
For the only plain site of gore
Rise from the crypt writhe no more
Wrapped in cold see the light mist
Scream in the night with a final hiss
Roasting the innards for me to bless
Drowning in bile, enjoying the mess
They begin to fade
Into the dreadful maze like the taste
Painted the wall with the blood of a slut
Everlasting scrolls are beginning to rot
I flow around you like a flood
Running as a mortal silhouette of a soul to die
Don't turn around, 'cause it's you I saw!
I see this evocation
I see young dead is there
I see decapitation
In the wake of pain, breeding death!
Breeding death!
Breeding death!
Embrace my doom!
The dead I screw!
Life is no more!
My sole existence in gore!
Conjure up my grave
Come near; be brave.
This vine I will lift, rip
The rapture deep in my head
Undertaker, fake servant of god
Followers they will take me to god
Fucking fools, doesn't matter that you pray!
You will die, 'cause it's you that I will slay!
Time to meet thy maker!
The noose tied around your neck!
But my eyes are open wide!
Evil and wicked ways!
You believe in god, just another broken neck
Mutilated delay the call
The sound of the bell remains
Falling into your demise
Reaping death across their eyes
Born as a freak in a killing breath
Ignorance prevails, breeding death
I see this evocation
I see young dead is there
I see decapitation
In the wake of pain, breeding death!

I'm watching the mountains I'm watching the sea
Observing the creatures I am lost, set me free
Across the heavens I made my way
I've seen empires rise and blown away
I have arrived at my destiny but after all there's just emptiness in me
Dot in the darkness, I am going mad
Where are the others, there's silence in my head
Cause I'm watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky
I'm trapped in this nightmare
Endless tortures and pain, millenniums have gone by
Uh, it drives me insane
Who am I now?
I'm not man, I'm not machine
I gave my life away for the Iron Savior dream
Cause I'm watcher in the sky
Hooked to the circuits of a lifeless, cold machine
Lost in a world of artificial means
Ripped out of my body
I'll stand the rest of time
Am I perpetual? Am I divine?
I'm a watcher in the sky
My soul has drowned in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the chosen one but I am lost in time
I'm a watcher in the sky I've seen the years go by
I am the chosen one
Out in the cold my systems overload and I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky
Watching the mountains, watching the sea, watching the creatures
You'll never be free
Watcher in the sky

I don't know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How we used to be
Is it you?
Or is it me?
Look in the mirror
We are a fading memory
Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold
I will live again you'll see, tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday, just take this pain away
Fatal chaos
Hurtful lies
A broken dream
Is all we left behind
Is it you?
Or is it me?
Look in the mirror
Just a fading memory
Where are we?
We got lost in the cold
I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take this pain away
I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take this pain away
I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take this pain away
I will live again
You'll see, you'll see

Many a weary night endured
Since the utter charm of joy has pured
My unquiet dreams, my misery
How sweet if I could share with thee
Unable to endure its smile
Which kindly eased my sombre veil
I frightened turned my burdened head
And hid in slumbers shade instead
But lifted from my mournful rest
Was I by thee nocturnal guest
When thou did vow to suffocate
My tranquil dreams in thrones bed
You spoke to me with loathed glow
And thus have thou not kept thy vow
For when thy shadow sprang on me
I closed my eyes in ecstasy

Head trip on the scene again
Pumping in the veins of the rabid mouths to feed
Head back, obsolete
Trapped with the secrets that I cannot keep today
You got it, intrusive
Erratic, elusive
Your heart aches, infliction
Sporadic in an aging contradiction
I have a dream, it's them and not me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my
Sugar my life, sweeten my tea
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my
You've got your hands around my throat
You've got your eyes inside my back
You lied, you lied, oh
Head spun by a thousand spiders
Sucked into their late night infomercials
Rolled back with every beat
Bound to the bond of a greater feature feat
You got it, intrusive
Erratic, elusive
Your heart aches, infliction
Sporadic in an aging contradiction
I have a dream, it's them and not me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my
Sugar my life, sweeten my tea
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh
You've got your hands around my throat
You've got your eyes inside my back
You lied, you lied, oh
I have a dream, it's them and not me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh my
Sugar my life, sweeten my tea, oh
You've got your hands around my throat
You've got your eyes inside my back
You lied, you lied, oh

2080 our world is an empty domain
Emotions have died
Men bleeding oil are the heroes for children today
Drinking the blood of the weak dictators bring pain
But they show us a smile
Feelings and love are kept hidden in a madhouse cave
It's a mad revolution
And the spirits will die
Oh escape the confusion
Take my hand
Now take my hand
Take me now
Take my hand
We won't be so free
Until we rise again
Eden is mad so enjoy it and fly to the sun
Don't you return
Your breath and your heartbeat are gifts
You've been given for life - oh yeah
Oh our deepest emotions
Are a sign of our life and our love
No robot can stop us
Take my hand
Now take my hand
Take me now
Take my hand
We won't be so free
Until we rise again
Now take my hand
Take me now
Take my hand
We won't be so free
Until we rise again
Now take my hand
Take me now
Take my hand
We won't be so free
Until we rise again
Yeah

Ignored and hated by many, he can't stand the very sight of himself.
Believing only that people wish him harm,
while all the time there is a sympathetic eye from an admiring lady.
As the years pass, she slowly gains his trust,
but not without incident.
Being of a passive and loving nature,
she helps to transform his anger with regression.
Eventually his fears are changed into a positive belief
in the goodness we all possess.
Ignored by the many, adored by the chosen few
Friends he hasn't any, just his own point of view
There stands a lady inbetween the shadows
Waiting patiently for you
Holding out her hand she whispers
Together we'll pull through
She transforms his anger
Helps him wipe away the tears
I'll be there, standing next to you
I'll be there I will pray, I will pray for you
'Cos you're one of the forgotten children

Visions - I'm not awake - nor do I sleep
Dreamin' dawn turns to dusk
Dwarves and fairies dance on my grave
There's a door to - wonderland
Fires, see fires darken the night
Brightness, dark brightness
Trapped in a hot air balloon
I can't believe it
But I believe it`s true
There's a shark
Climbing thru' my heart
Stars shine when the moon heat
Cools my thoughts
The still of the night is so noisy
All faked or true
Tell me - what I will see
Is there a new world
To be found - behind the mirror
Wake up - open me eyes
Light a cigarette and smoke
Smell the taste of coffee
Am I back to wonderland?

Do angels fly higher in the dark?
Black is my mind when a new day has come
Black are the tears when I cry
Come here and take my hand,
Join this misery
The fallen angel will set us free
Do angels fly higher in the dark?
Do they crash down and fall apart?
Let's cut the wings away
And the angel has fallen again
Together in eternal flames
Where the cold razor cares

Under the raven black sky
she revel with the wolves of night
following the moonshadow
embracing the winter frost.
Six stars in northern sky
gathers with the wind and light
set the fire behind the mist
wings before the darkest death.
The beauty of eternal dark
lurking in the shadows of trees
forever burning wisdom is free
cast the stars beyond this dream.
Every weakness of her sight
as confused as day and night
she's passing the light of mountain so bright
with these feelings sun will die.
Night, the garden of divine
stands alone in twilight
like roses of breeze they die.
As darkness falls inside the halls
walls of reality will be torn
down under and up again
lady winter leaves her mark.
Burning in the astral winds
under the cold silvery moon
upon the clouds of black, deep sky
cast the stars beyond the night.

Oh yeah
Young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
If you wanna rise from the hollow
The future in sight
The past in your head
Nightmare or treason
The father above you as you
Walk through the ashes
Don't you run out of reason
You keep waiting
For your choice to be made
There ain't no bounty
For the number of passions
You rein in for love
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue we falter
Forever is a long time
Pleasure and pain feel all the same
To the dreamer who's trying to get closer
Strange how it feels in reality
When your fairytale is over
No right or wrong
I just keep going on
And I don't get lost in belief
Falter and pray
Keep looking away
I don't wanna see
We keep on waiting
For a choice to be made
There ain't no bounty for the passion
We rein in for love
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue we falter
Forever is a long time
Forever is a long time
It's gonna take forever
Oh - young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
Wanna rise from the hollow
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue we falter
Forever is a long time

Is it not ironic
How your favorite dread
Is the matrix in which you were formed
The unfathomable dark
Of a realm arcane and burrowed far below
The grain sprouts deep from 'neath the soil
Where sunlight will never ever, ever reach
Behold
From darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend
To darkness we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul
The darkness of the night goes out
When dawn befalls in the time between the times
And the grain in the soil, buried deep
Shall not bear fruit unless it dies
In the dark of Antumnos
The Awen waves and life is conceived
Behold
From darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend
To darkness we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul
The day is born from the night
In the three night of Samon the year is born
So the song has been sung
Let him hear it who will
Is it not ironic
How you cling so hard
To all evidence of all there is
As you maintain your unbroken urge
To explain what you can't
The child grows in its mother's womb
Enshrouded and concealed
Behold
From darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend
To darkness we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

You're gone!
You're gone!
Your body's cold
Hope is lost, I can't let go
Can I die with you,
So we can never grow old?
Cut the ties (Cut the ties)
With this note you left behind
As I heed the words I hear you telling me why
Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone,
To a place where you belong
My sadness shows,
As your name is carved in stone
Can't erase the words so the reality grows
I wish I died (I wish I died)
On that night right by your side
So just kill me now and let the good times roll
Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong
Will you wait for me? (Will you wait for me?)
Will I see you on the other side?
You won't have to wait too long
Yeah
Will you come to me? (Will you come to me?)
Will you take me to the other side?
'Cause here I don't belong
Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong
I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why
I'm wasting
Away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong

My life fades, my visions dim
All that remains are memories
I remember a time of chaos
Time of war
As men began to feed on man
Only the scavengers survived
Gone now, swept away
For reasons long forgotten
Touched of a blase
Which engulfed them all
A firestorm of fear
The answer is written in their bones
All life ends
I remember an old man
Griping my wrist, he was dying
"Imagine", he said
"Looking into the eyes of a nova,
The bursting flames, the roar of it's energy
Faintly echoing down the corridors of time,
Whispering: all life ends
"Death, he said "is like a bolt of lightning,
Light cast upon every secret,
Just for a moment, till the last spark of life fades
And all is dark"
Then he breathed out his last breath into my ear
His gaze already way out among the stars
Among the ruins of the past
I shelter from the storm
My mind is numb from the loneliness
And the rain that never stops
This wasteland, once a beautiful place
Where trees and flowers grew
Where deer, and squirrels had their home
Now rotting are their bones
Where raging waters grind the earth
I go to end my days
The sea that witnessed mankind's birth
Shall watch us die again
Black and deep,
Empty of life
As in the heaven so below
The sun has now forever set
And bids our time to go
I am tired
And I fear not
The cold that now descends
As light grows dim, I bid farewell
All life ends
I am leaving now, my body stiff
Just watching for a while
That rigid shell, so small and weak
A corpse on a broken cliff
The stars are calling me now
With distant, speechless voices
And caught by a wind I drift away
And nothing calls me to stop
I am ridin' the wind that has no name,
The fire that burns without a flame
Caught by the spell on which all depends,
All life ends
The answer is written in my bones,
All life ends

I've seen you, I've seen you
The double-headed one
You appeared to me like an obscene child
You've revealed, you've disclosed
All your secret lust
All the glory of your double properties
The supreme beauty of all your perfect being
Solve et coagula, hermaphrodite
Chased and geburah, hermaphrodite
You're the bearer of light
You're the horned god
Without limits, without shadows, without fears
You are woman and man
You're the quintessence
You're the substance of all elements and laws
Father, mother, son and daughter all in one
Solve et coagula, hermaphrodite
Chased and geburah, hermaphrodite
You can give us the key
Of your seven seals
The great power of all your sexual spells
You're the devil who has found
Our inner truth
The vibration of the energy that feeds
Friend and lover, brother, sister all in one
Solve et coagula, hermaphrodite
Chased and geburah, hermaphrodite

fisting
money fills all who mind it
fisting all find it
circle one for the show
you're bound to take its blow
bloodlust, greed in progress
blows over
multiply, lost society

Under the moon pain lays
How grow to come starring eyes
These Norway Mountains souring hearts
To would that shies make it be cry
To veil in shade the burden feast
For million screeds to love within
Strike to darkness, to my heart
Seeking in silence wisdom aside
I weed you when it stands right under the moon stay in light
Time is the pain bound the fate of the night
What be in after in your blight
Sunlight dying my marching curved off the sky
Sunrise dying my marching curved off the soul
With the deem with the funeral virtues of pain
Coming through the vulture nothing the same
Pits of ghost hear my voice feeding me back
Torture Demon let pare forever the slain:shriek, kill, obey!
Torture scrip no reckon blow the piece of your mind
Hearting black and destruction on hear real trough

The past has enslaved that all
We built for the future life
Through an endless age of twilight
We tried to regain our pride
Strangers ruled us by the divine right
Mastered our fate just as they liked
In spite the pain and desperation
We never forgot the name of our NATION

Late last night I awoke in a dream
To the sound of a voice that was almost a scream
From out of the city and out of the street
Out where the wind hits the cold concrete
It's cold outside
Darkness your enemy
No place to hide
The voice said this to me
In your doorways I have shivered
In your alleys I have gone to ground
But I will be delivered
Someday I will be mercy bound
I dreamed again it was West LA
On a crowded street on a hot summer day
She was alone
Three months late and beginning to show
In a midriff blouse she would soon outgrow
She had no one to call and no way home
And in my mind I knew I'd seen myself
But in our blindness it always seems like someone else
There I was a rag a bone
A remnant in your lost and found
I was for once truly alone
Longing to be mercy bound
And I knew that I would wander
As a child in the forest till they found me
And I called out to them but could not penetrate
The silence all around me
And when I wake I know you'll comfort me
And I won't sleep again for an eternity
But others lie awake at night
In desperation more profound
And the coming of the morning light
Will not see them mercy bound
And some will never dream again
From sleeping on the ground
Longing to belong
And dying to be mercy bound
Oh please don't stop your dreaming
Someday we'll all be mercy bound

All eyes must be on you.
It's a pity you're addicted too.
Now go ahead, manipulate them.
Initiating doubt, a new dynamic found.
By sharing all your weightless problems.
All on the outside looking in.
Take this moment to see what you've begun.
Display this moment to see what you've become.
Defined by what you sell, those lies packaged well.
But you know that we can see right through you.
Attention's wearing thin so type it out again.
I hope this all made you happy.
Forfeit all of your integrity for a temporary high.
Lay it all out for the world to see.
Manufacture one more lie.

Desperation, you've tempted me on too many times for
me to
turn my back on you again. I lust for your
gift to ease the pain for us all.
Accept the fact
that their death can prevent our fears. Not the plot
of
cowardice, but the birth of a saviour. Acceptance
of a martyr's role.
Extricate these demons from
sight. Risking life and limb. Vigil martyr, set
the
foundation of tolerance at any extreme. Even the price
of suicide. Even a
price so high as this. The seas
of love must part to act on their behalf. For
while
we weep, they still rape, raping our patience for
change. Off the hook
for feigned insanity, but not
off the hook from the public. In the media and
in
the flesh, a crucifixion will be in order, a
celebration of politically
correct's death. We will
dance with our children once again. Their security
is reinstated by this bastard's sacrifice.

My quiet steps
And the sound of being alone
Line my home
Mask the edge of my reality
Swallowing lament
No more than a fading memory
I cease my steps and lift the rose
Beautiful and so deadly to the sinister side of my world
In silence I've lived, in silence I've grown
It gave me everything I have in my soul
Here only the echoes of my past thoughts are to follow
Dusk points a finger at me
From a world I no longer recognize
The circle of thoughts has vanished
My cage is gone
In depths I am without sin
I have become the wolf that dwelled inside me
Only my nightmares still faintly
Imitate the life I had
The final comforting
In a silent question
I now cast a shadow
On the arms I have searched for eternity

Arise thy king
O ruler of Rhine
Devastation lust for war
A perilous quest to conquer the West
I long for the days of the innocence
We've pushed them away
Barbaric be thy name
We've pushed them away
Tattoo your face for war
The scourge of God
Anything goes as I raise my sword
Chastise
My brother's demise
An endless conquest for more
An unsettled score
Why haven't we learned from our mistakes
Why put on the crown of thorns
Why waste your time
Its all been done before

A folk of cheeriness and strength
Content with the life they lived
So-called barbarians yet with eyes cleered
For what they truly need and what damn not
Free and plain
Barbarians, farmers and savages
Counted as ignorant and uncivil
But told to bow before the emperors throne
They were at least not venal
True and plain freedom - of this natures clan
True and plain pride - of this celtic clan
True and plain dignity - Tegernako!

Bury me
Just leave me to sleep in the dirt
Finish me
I'm floating away
There's a demon staring straight through your eyes
Am I wasting my time?
Something's turning inside of me
You make me feel like I'm fucking drowning (I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out)
You made my world come crashing down around me
(I need to cut you out)
Oh God I wish you'd just speak to me
Black is all that I see
Speak to me
You used to be all that I needed
I've been crucified and hung out to dry
Yet my heart still beats and I feel so alive
This time I'll fight for myself as you try to fuck me over
I bet you never cared
I knew you never cared
You make me feel like I'm fucking drowning (I need to cut you out, I need to cut you out)
You made my world come crashing down around me
(I need to cut you out)
Speak to me
Black is all that I see
Speak to me
You used to be all that I needed

Practicing the silence
Muting all the sounds you hear
Someone's getting violent
Cutting off all the ends you steal
Signs of forward progress
Still wrapped tight inside and sealed
Free me from this madness
And I'll never look back to heal
Silence in your sleep
And people they are weak
Cutting all connections
That led you two to speak
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Practicing the silence
Underlined from all your pain
Slowly slipping backwards
Calling out Gods name in vain
Signs of forward progress
Chanting that you're almost free
You whispered to me
And told me that your life wasn't me
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Another day and another weak
Type of death is a disease
So damn blind and so am I
Your underlined
Another day and another weak
Type of death is a disease
So damn blind and so am I
Your underlined
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Turn away, turn away
Turn away, turn away
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Death is a disease
People they believe
Almost out of time
I said your underlined
Death is a disease
Death is a disease
Death is a disease
I said your underlined

you did it once
you did it twice
you've sinned again, and spit on Christ
you asked forgiveness the other day
same sin repeated, don't you get it?
you don't know how to repent
wearing grace thin, it's such a shame
no willpower, lack of loyalty
a new excuse, a dangerous game
repeated - you've sinned again
weakness - you mock God
mercy - your credit card
you can't fool God - God's not mocked
as the dog returns to its vomit
so the fool returns to his folly
will you learn from your mistakes?
will you turn from your sin?
you face the world and turn from God
that's your bag and it's so wrong
you don't know how to repent
forgiveness starts and sinning ends
when you're weak he is strong
stop excusing yourself for wrong

I pack my things I go
I leave you all alone
Well J. it's about time
To face the facts
Our relationship sucks
After six years of sex with you I'm blured
Oh even a beauty can bore
Monogamy, my agony
Is not inborn
When I've said
I've done it all for you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were sad
I was there
Yeah
I lied
All the nights I spent through
Lying next to you
Listening to your breath
It's such a drag
To loose the best I've ever had
To accept the fact that I will miss you
To ignore the fear of being alone
My Venus is there nothing left between us
Monogamy my agony
Is not inborn
When I've said
I've done it all for you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were sad
I was there
Yeah
I lied

Clot - by my own closed mind poisoned
Images self imagination - sense of
Reckoning halts its gestation attitude
And feelings unable to relate the iron
Barrier my subconscious creates
Clot, clot, clot, micro-electric
Memories solitairily confined preventing
New additions to the archives of my
Mind confrontation of my lobes to bridge
The gap where knowledge flows knowing
What I thought is hidden from me -
Confrontation of my lobes to bridge the
Stream where knowledge flows

You have become a malicious liar that breathes for attention. playing charades, wearing the head of a lamb. My days consumed by nights of you. Howling at the moon as if you were wounded but no, you're the one showing teeth, ready to feast on newborn beginnings as you cry wolf. We know, 8,064 hours of conspiracy. 200 months which brings me 17 years of lies and betrayal. The truth, Never seen. Never told. Never known. You'll never tell the truth. All I want is the truth. Queen of hearts, but you are the deceiver with a lying tongue and matching lips. My heart thirsts for vengeance but my father has taught me forgiveness. If I had not decided to follow Him, I'd devour you like a lion, leaving your bones out to dry. I'd put you through the same hell you put me through, pouring out conspiracies and lies, but this world will remember me for all that I've done and all that I'll be. The victim in me is dead. I am reborn. So even though you call me self-righteous and call my beloved treacherous, there is one thing to take away. Leveler, make level the road for the righteous. i forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me, He will show you true love.

I know I'm always here
And I will always beg "forgive us".
It's just that I am always gone.
So we'll start with a question.
Why's this on me?
What's it have to do with faith?
There will always be us and me.
I'm just sick of being lonely.
Like the winds and her faint breeze.
Like the church to set me free.
I'm dead to those I tried to impress.
I'm dead to those who had my trust.
I'm dead to distance and to home.
I'm dead to me, I died by the throne.
Martyrs, hear me out.
Never claim what's not forever.
Never claim what's not forever.
Judas, watch us weep.
Live and die by your betrayal.
More doubts to be answered.
Where will it all end?
When is the Lord's hour?
There will always be us and me.
I'm just sick of being lonely.
Like the winds and her faint breeze.
Like the church to set me free.
I'm dead to those I tried to impress.
I'm dead to those who had my trust.
I'm dead to distance and to home.
I'm dead to me, I died by the throne.
I'm dead to those I tried to impress.
I'm dead to those who had my trust.
I'm dead to distance and to home.
I'm dead to me, I died by the throne.
Martyrs, hear me out.
Live and die by your lover's heart.
Why's this on me? Why's this on me?
Martyrs, hear me out.
Live and die by your lover's heart.
Live and die by your lover's heart.

On the edge of dawn
Light ends the dark of day
Mourning star at dusk
Brightens with our decay
Forward, just one step
Millions of miles away
Floating back in time
Titans without delay
Wellspring of youth
Drinking your sweet water
Falling like stones - so bitter our tears
Of the one and only truth
Well, you're my fountain
For some you're deep as graves
For others high as mountains
Neverending youth

O yee one eyed old man.You who see it all
You who see the past and all to be
Say,yee one eyed old man. For I need to know
Tell me which path fate has chosen for me
Say does the Northstar still shine on me
Say will I set my loved ones free
O yee one eyed old man.Of yee our elders told
You have been since land and sky was one
And if you really knows all that will be,tell me
What the future wants with this young no one`s son
Say does the Northstar still shine on me
What for you see in store for me
"Questions, questions. Many you ask
About the future and some of the past.
Few have seen what I see,fewer still will ever know.
I gave an eye to see a better
And you thirst fo knowlenge grows.
But you,my chld, who treads the road of pain.
Who have felt such anger. Such that bears no name.
Thee shall I nurse as if you were my own son.
And this very night your training will already have begun.
For I have seen you come for a thousand years or so.
And the gods have told me to teach you all that
I possess and know.
And though me eye no longer sees
My hand held out in front of me,
I sill gaze crystal clear at all
That moral man cannot see.
And I see you riding up on a stallion as white as snow
Which the speed of the winds and endurance unold
And you wield a sword of steel forget in fire an ice.
And the cry of a warrior you sound
And victory is in our eyes.
Hear me my son,for you are the chosen one."

And so it's the end
The hollow end
So speed the process
Again and again
Move as fast as you can
Like the wind
On no end
Horizontal flickering
Like flash before my eyes
Recurring pictures
The holocaust
Over and over
Burnt into my mind
Like bright stars
I will deliver
Your work shall be forever
I will endure
Keep my strength in you
Memories fade
Cease to pause
To measure time
To treasure day
But when I see it
The way I see it

Shatter my emotions
Take them all away
Left alone to face You
Now You know my heart
Left only to speak what is true
See through this plague of flesh
With truth I say that I love You
Yet my heart betrays me
Be not far from me
For these voices
They must soon cease
Despite their betrayal
You died for me

These are not 100%, they are going by ear.
Never
underestimate
your next opponent.
It will be a dark
catastrophe of great proportion
The challenge has begun,
when the hammer falls I know that we will all step forward, in a rush
Domination by the masses!
Kicking you down, beating you down!
WE WON'T FALTER.
Beating you down, push you away!
They can't deny your destiny.
WE WON'T FORGET!
Believing in a power, they make their walls collide and falsify your (gods visions?) and your opponent will be living in failure, failure. Failure, failure.
Taste the potent stench of pride!
The people scream in horror.
For the reign effect is in full play,
but it's then the public scream your way,
the people all will applaud.
Applaud your demise!
Break down the opponent that you must fear.
You can't take the burning.
Don't ever deny the power within,
You can defeat all that oppose
Feel
my
hatred!
Eyes burning red.
Radiation.
Of our anger.
We will flourish!
As they fall we will flourish!
RISE AND OPPOSE!

Blood
You are a painting in the sky
Superior legions
Run superior plans
Who's gonna change the world for you today
Well, I guess you wouldn't want it any other way
Throwing
You in and out the game
Showing
That this world will still spin when you're gone
Throwing you in and out the game
Showing that this world that we're in, not to sin
Will still spin when you are gone
Red
Who stole the gentleman's hat
Yesterday's matters
Today only letters
We haven't seen you for so long
Now that we see it all seems so wrong
Throwing
You in and out the game
Showing
That this world will still spin when you're gone
Throwing you in and out the game
Showing that this world that we're in
Will still spin when you are gone
Imminence
A proof, a hidden evidence
For no reason
Life is against you
Silent
Conspiracy
Goddamned
Are you the beat
Are you the melody
Hegemony
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the emperor of us all
Bow down, follow the pain
May guilt be thy master
And remorse be thy name

Hate, war and terror, murder, disaster
Rape, drugs and violence, lost in our failure
Fear is suffering, intimidate to obey
Fear is control, suffering is hell
Police enforce obedient behavior
Manufactured weapon of conformity
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
It is the most strategic tool used to manipulate
Intimidation to make me weak in order to obey
Strategy to manipulate, paralyze, intimidate
Righteous greed suffocates, a powerful fear campaign
Mind killing, restricting
Fear is the enemy on my path
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
Fear is your God

Downward the shores we pass
Clouds bathed in sombre twilight
Dust beneath our dragging feet
The crumbled shapes of your image
Left behind the dreams of a time
That is fading away tirelessly
Paralyzed we are
The light of old aged stars
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
[Incomprehensible]
When it comes to the dying season
Will you stay right at our side?
When we leave this place together
Through the glens of the afterlife
At the shores of the tranquil sea
Waves take the land tirelessly
Take our thoughts away
To the light of old aged stars
Still in my mind
Still in my mind
Only among the stars, there lies freedom
Only among the stars, there is eternity
Only for one short moment our lives do last
Until all the memories are wasted away
From the shores out of our galaxy
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling

Control of power
Strangles, strangles the mind
Collapse of the system
Destruction begins
from within
Mutilated by sound
Signaling all the senses
Out of mind
Out of soul
The trauma begins
A story never told
From the past
A show remains
Conspiracy aided
Toxic shock
Chorus:
They all lie in a trance
Those idealistic fools
Bent on crutches
All of them bleed
in their tracks
They never look back
"????"
Christ, Christ, Christ
What have they done to me?
Christ, Christ
What have they done to me?
"Wait for me you maniac, I don't know what's going on"

Buried machines
Connecting the unseen
Information warfare
Aggression and betrayal
Radiation codes
Psycho-nerve warfare

Humanity is covered by the veil of suffocation compassionated world is set on fire the
leaders rule with no regret dead bodies have formed the absolute the foundation of
oppression they have been given is the result of nations history has driven this engulfed
world we have to set free this crippled bodies we have to heal Most western civilisations
often take their social and economical structures as the basic platform for a healthy
society. Without considering the cultural and social evolution, they try to stamp their
own meaning of life onto other civilisations in the meaning of being the only "right"
solution for all their problems. We have to fight this triumph of loss.

I touch the string though the harp may not sing
Still I dare the sky for sun sparks to guide
Down below there's a land
With an ominous hole
Deep in the sand of belief
A million doves
orbit round the Earth with tears of blood
Kill the virgin, take

Cry with a smile
My heart is bleeding, bewildered, I'm here alone
Why is there pain in a beautiful moment?
Why do I feel so lost, so empty?
Cry with a smile
My heart is healing from pain I knew that would come
Why is there luck in a deeply sad moment?
Why do I feel so calm, so peaceful?
Take my heart and set it free
Take my heart and give it time to heal
I know in my memories you'll live
Take my heart a little while
Take it with you to the place you'll go
I know we will meet again someday
Cry with a smile
My heart was dreaming of time I knew would come to an end
Why do I cry about a beautiful memory?
Why do I feel so hurt, so lonely?

They said that I can't change without you.
That I can't change without you.
That I can't change without you.
Those nights I can't sleep.
I'm stuck here.
Lost in your dreams.
I'm stuck in here.
Like why can't I get much better?
Like why can't I get much better?
So swipe it and take it away.
And never, never lie to me.
So swipe it and take it away.
And never, never lie to me.
The only reason my eyes close.
So they open with you by my side.
Like why can't I get much better?
Like why can't I get much better?
So swipe it and take it away.
And never, never lie to me.
So swipe it and take it away.
And never, never lie to me.
I wait for tomorrow
So open your eyes my darling.
Today's a new day.
Like why can't I get much better
Like why can't I get much better
Like why can't I
Like why can't I
Get better

Grant me the powers of thunder
And give me a sword forged in the raging Hell's fire
Lend me the eight legged black stallion of Odin and I'll have my vengeance,
oh, I'll kill with desire
Vengeance flows like boiling poison through my twisted veins
Tonight I'll blood shed with wrath and set the night on flames
Invincible in battle, war gods hear my death wish cry
I'll laugh in the face of death, I into glory ride
Snarling breath upon your backs, I'm vengeance incarnate
Now it's time, the moment's comed, stand up now, face my hate
See the fire in my eyes, the final light you'll see
I send you to the darkness with my sword of thunder and steel
[Repeat second verse]

[music: nick, aborted; lyrics: nick]
Abraising your eye socket walls
imploding your eyeballs
orgasm piercing through your brain
shining cum, perforating pain
I pull the trigger and I cum
with your head spreared on my gun
observe the metal coming near
the gory end of your moral fear
Riot-fuck the faecial breed
Hallowed be this cleansing dead
Frightened face splits wide open
Sickly pleased I shoot again
Cranium spread all over the floor
Chunks of brain slide from the door
i could kill every last one of you
Skullfuck you all is what I'll do

Four hundred thousend years ago
They came from outer space
And gave us life here
We are taking everything for granted
I don't think we should do this now
And when I see the smoke all around
I feel like I'm now
From humankind down there
I feel like glaciers are my eyes
And mountains are my head
My heart is ocean
And I feel all alone
Because everybody's wrong
I feel the living
What is this thing that we call hate
And that's inside of me
Get out of here!
A world is down
And none can rebuild it
Disabled lands are evolving
My eyes are shut, a vision is dying
My head explodes
And I fall in disgrace
I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry
"don't fear the living"
One day you will stand as a king
And now fear can erase
This light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have
This truth is growing
And as a warrior I have to fight
I can already feel
The love I'll discover
I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always growing
And all the worlds
The fates all the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time
I never fell and always believed in
We could evolve and get older
Open your eyes and let all this flow
Now see a now hope is growing inside

I am eternal
The ruler of the earth and sky
I am infernal
I am on a quest to see the heavens die
My fascination with the dead
Won't be fulfilled here on this killing spree
And when they dream
That's when my spirit arise
And when they scream
A little part of them dies
I find my way into the minds of the weak
They are led astray
It's now my path that they seek
You die before me
Your destiny is in my hands
You are soon to see
My one desire is to rule this world eternally
And when they dream
That's when my spirit arise
And when they scream
A little part of them dies
I find my way into the minds of the weak
They are led astray
It's now my path that they seek
You will never reach me
I am the darkest one
You will never heal me
A mind beyond repair
I will make you fear me
I slay your hopes and dreams
You're lost forever
In this world of mine
I devastate your life
And crush your every dream
No human being will perceive your silent scream
The king of rapture will betray your soul tonight
The life of yours is soon to end in brutal death
Don't look me in the eyes if you are awake
Just a glimpse of me will put your life at stake
I am the horizon
I am the serpent of the dead
My gaze will burn your skin and flesh into a crisp
Like fire
Like fire
This very morbid mind of mine
Will set your course into and early grave
I twist your fate and seal your doom
I bit you welcome my eternal slave

Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
No, I won't, foretold coast to coast
Footloose scenarios can't break my fame
Maintain, trade, meditate, all hours, can't wide
Operate straight from this place I say
Tall words, we'll stop to where I foretold to give
Or I will stop to drop what was still
I stop to clutch my blood
Fucked up thoughts turned the plot
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Cut much, caught up, tossed enough, got it rough
Thinking much about staying above
The dust fit into battle, handle cheap shots
Respond or be gone beyond this Babylon, con
I've hurt worse than this, turn it into new purposes
Heard nervousness brings curses
It will take more than your amount to house
My count, so bounce, I hold it down
Catchin' a bad one, catchin' a bad one
Catchin' a bad one, catchin' a bad one
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Can't believe it's happening again
All this hasn't convinced to the transcend
This can't be forced out of me
That familiar push can strain my energy
Can you be here to challenge my fate
If so, you can't be stronger than predestined days
Force me in a corner and we'll both lose
The value of this is far beyond me or you, me or you, love
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Catchin' a bad one, catchin' a bad one

Walls collapse onto me, I ride the storm of rage
A mistake became a chain, reaction and the
Reflection falls upon me
It's time for change, understanding and
Faith are what friends are about, but on every corner
Disappointment (is waiting, every wall would have
Understood me better), I am cold.
I stand alone and all that remains is the hope
For help, the anger is strong and threatens to
Destroy me, because what was will never be again,
Too much has happened and the mind becomes dull,
It is the tragedy of time, a sea of tears for grief,
But from the shadows of my tears, of my past, you
Come and give me your hand, tame my anger
My tears fade and together we fight as friend
Together we fight as friend for (the) time

Inflict the seed of Eve upon me
The heritage of Cain can't be undone
This my rejection, this my denial
That stirs with repulsive mortifications
They attempted to deprive me from my odium of chaos
They threw my wretched body into rivers of purgatory
For such is a consequence of my angelic nature
Abortion of god in my leprous womb
Soiled with the miasma of the bleakest hemisphere
The formless fires of Amenti unfold
Not nearly as frenzy as Discordia that breeds within
Not nearly as frenzy as disorder that I bring
Universe is drained, so is my heart
This earth grew weary and dull
Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence?
Is there a future for me beyond the stars?
I drink to desolation
I drink to your demise
Monarch of neglected kingdom
Oh, great despiser of life
Et credo in serpentem
Misterium mysteriorum
In nomen eius Baphomet
Hearken my Ophites
Consume the flesh and drink the blood
Obtain communion with utmost disgrace
Reject the benefits of Eucharist
Disdain the lie, let you senses sharpen
Let your eyes see in the boundless dark
Resist not radiant light
Be like comets slashing through the vast skies
Be like ravening wolves unchaining hearts
Now drink to desolation
Drink to god's demise
Monarch of neglected kingdom
Oh, great despiser of life
O leo et o serpens
Qui perditor perdes
Sis valens nobiscum

FOOLS! I cast you all aside!
Your bullets harm me not
I am heresy, blazing hell
The embodiment ov all you fear
I am all which you can never be
A truth revealing hate machine
No longer will I tolerate
Lies from a kingdom built on dread
Yet what if naught exists above?
No shining glory and no god
You question not, blindly believe
Upon your ignorance I shall feast
Damn higher virtues, divine love
Your wooden idols and your law
Kneel before your god yet do not see
He doth feel you lies
Blinds you with fear
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Your hearts I shall tear
With paws ov truth
With slashing jaws I rape
Your feeble womb
No god exists to save you from thy doom
You will never see the light!
Bound to always live by lies!

Eleanor Rigby Picks up the
Rice in the church
Where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream Waits at the
Window Wearing the face that
She keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie Writing the
Words of a sermon that no one
Will hear No one comes near
Look at him working Darning
His socks in the night when
There's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Eleanor Rigby Died in the
Church and was buried along
With her name Nobody came
Father McKenzie Wiping the
Dirt from his hands as he walks
From the grave No one was saved
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all
The lonely people

Can you save my soul a little while ?
Your words and sins will cure it
If you just try.
Can you be the guardian of my flame ?
Don't ever let it be apeased by the rain.
I am an angel
Who's burned his wings staying too close to hell
Can you help me find my way back to myself
Sometimes I feel I'm lost inside someone else.
Can you bring back colors into my world ?
You're like the rainbow in the winter's cold.
I am an angel
Who cannot seem to be in phase with heaven
Teach how to fly again,
My wings are trapped inside my brain.
You're the one who ease my pain
You can help me fly again.
Take me to your own universe,
And put an end to this curse.
Thee used to be a time
When I could reach the stars at the speed of light
But like Icarus, I've been too close, too soon,
to a burning sun...
Fly...

You tried to stand in my way
Pushing me, pushing me to fail
Nothing was good enough for you
Now the tables have turned
And its your lesson learned
How does it feel to be so wrong
You were always in the back of my mind
But now your lies mean nothing to me now
I'll prove you wrong
You were always pushing me down
But now I'm here standing on my own
I'll stand here on my own and prove you wrong
You were wrong
Look at me now
Look at me now
So look at me now
Don't close your eyes and ignore me
How does it feel to be so wrong
How do you like me now
Ohhh
I'll prove you wrong
I use your lies to motivate me
You crossed the line one to many times
I use your lies to motivate me
You crossed the line one to many times
One too many
You were always in the back of my mind
But now your lies mean nothing to me now
I'll prove you wrong
You were always pushing me down
But now I'm here standing on my own
I'll stand here on my own and prove you wrong
(So look at me now, dont close your eyes and ignore me)
I'll prove you wrong
You can't ignore me
You were always pushing me down
But now I'm here standing on my own
I'll stand here on my own and prove you wrong
You were always in the back of my mind
You were always in the back of my (Mind)
You were always in the back of my mind
You were always in the back of my
You were always in the back of my mind
You were always in the back of my

A barbaric land where the sword is the law,
and killing is the way of life.
An infernal wasteland and down a barren plain;
A warrior stands the test of fate.
His face is cracked from the wicked hands of time,
and scars from war have past,
Taking the reins from a shadowy steed,
I shall kill the foyus at it's layer!
Morbid Scream!
Skulls and bones lie relics in the sand;
Remembrance of men that came before.
The ground is scorched from the dragon's breath,
and corpses burned to stench and ash.
I awake in fury when the dragon attacks;
Advancing in anger - spitting fire.
Our barbarous laws, my thundering axe,
yet we'll fight the beast to it's death!

Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscape comes to life
I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasm sweep my role
I am Lucifer, I bring you light and pride
Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the ten lines
(but) I'll shoot you full of signs
In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings
You wouldn't know if I was him

calculations leaving me confused.
no matter how you work it out
you're always gonna lose.
you helped me to believe it.
working hours for a quiet life.
working through the daytime. . .
working through the night.
you helped me to believe it.
mind over muscle,
muscle ouer mind,
big men come down so hard.
mind over muscle, muscle over mind,
big men shout very loud.
come with me quick quick slow, quick quick slow, quick quick slowly.
all the people feel the same way here.
they said why can't we change things,
they said why don't they care.
you helped me to believe it.
round and round in circles
with the same idea we're going round
and round in circles.
you helped me to believe it.
mind over muscle, muscle over mind,
big men come down so hard.
come with me quick quick slow, quick quick slow, quick quick slowly.

Gimme something to eat
Gimme what you got
And I don't want beans cause they make me fart
I don't want no chili
No siree
Cause that leaves skid marks in my BVDs
I don't want no yogurt
Tastes like shit
I don't want a glass of milk from a cow's long tit
And no I aint in the mood for a juicy steak
And I don't want to yodel for some chocolate cake
I don't want a Big Mac or a number three
Hurry up homeboy now take a look at me
Cause I'm starving - I am about to cry
I could eat this b-b-burger on a piece of rye
Bread - I said
Cause if I don't eat soon then soon I will be dead
Cause in a minute or two I'm a cause some damage
If you don't cook me up a pork chop sandwich
Pork chop sandwich
Heat it up, heat it up
Heat it up, heat it up y'all y'all
I don't give a fuck if it is five days old
And I really don't care if it's hot or cold
I really don't mind if the bread got mould
Cause my pork chop sandwich cannot be sold
Oh shit I can smell it baking
Hands off junior cause this one's taken
Now oh shit it's almost done
I'm a slap that nigger right between two buns
Perhaps two pieces of pumpernickel
Put em in the toaster that I bought at Rickel's
Or did I get it at Top Supplying City
I really don't remember cause my stomach feels shitty now
Pork chop sandwich
Heat it up, heat it up
Heat it up, heat it up y'all y'all
I'm about to eat this lovely treat
Two pieces of bread with some pork chop meat
You want a bite
You want a bite right?
Well open up sucker cause here it comes
So
Pork chop sandwich
Heat it up, heat it up
Heat it up, heat it up y'all y'all
Eat it

Give it me back my head is burning
I just see it
Give it me back my head is burning
Gotta eat it

Just see it
And I'm (?)
Gimme my fucking sandwich
You piece of shit

She's a dead horse. There's no sense in beating her into the ground. She's a dead horse. Accept it and move on. No matter how many times you kick her in the chest she will not take another breath. And don't let the twitches fool you. It's just nerves, it won't last. There's something newer and better waiting to take her place. But you won't move on. So as you sit here beating a dead horse we'll be riding circles around you.

Go!
Clear that shit. Don't stop until the green is gone and your thumb gets hot. You gotta breath in deep, recollect your thoughts because it's time to take this shot.
Raise your drinks, raise your lighters it's about to go down. We can sleep in the morning, wake up and burn down. This is probably the best night I've ever had. We can do Strikeouts! all through the night.
But we're not quite over yet, come over here. Chug! Chug! Chug! Finish that beer!

Oh yeah
Watching a face and a smile and a light
When yo're walking alone in the street
I know your look always gives you the might
Many miles from your ass to your feet
And I dream what I've seen
Is what I want it to be selfmade reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died
Look like a queen but you talk like a pawn and I know you're a fool in disguise
Godfather tell me how to carry on
Blinded by fantasies of lies
And I dream what I've seen
Is what I want it to be self made reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died
I see your smile, a golden masquerade
And I know my dream it will be my fate
Time has stolen my fantasy
'Cause it has become a pale reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died

How could I ever see
This blueprint of reality
Spoiling for a fight I left no stone unturned
for ever and one day
The gale force in my heart will stay
And I don't care a straw about the lessons learned
[pre-chorus]
Free I can hear this haunting melody
Ever since the spirits rose in me
[chorus]
The shadows of darkness
Or the light of the world
Leaving those energetic streams
A soldier of fortune
Or a fancier at all
Keeping on for perennial dreams
will this tide ever turn
Before my restless heart will burn
The elfstruck time elapses to the eventide
it is a game of skill
And it is playing with your will
The floatlight marks the harbour there it is my guide
[pre-chorus]
[chorus]
[bridge]
The spangled heaven's gleam
A neverending stream
Will arise in my perennial dream
[chorus]

As I gaze into my crystal ball, I II tell you what I see,
Slowly but surely it s genocide, the fate that we shall meet.
We say we are the civilized, none as advanced as we,
Seeking the knowledge of space and time,
As we poison the earth, the sea, and sky...
All we see is the ground beneath our feet, never looking twice,
Take a look around the world at all the ignorant sacrifice.
Profit was the main thing on our agenda through all of the years,
Never thought twice about a living thing or
All of the future tears we II cry.
The fact is without a doubt,
Our time is running out,
Heaven help us.
Tons of acid and toxic waste, are dumped in the air we breathe,
Millions of barrel of nuclear waste, beneath the earth and sea,
The price of pollution cannot be set, it s an unworldly cost.
The damage is done and we cannot forget, the senseless
And needless lost of life...

Horribly disfigured sadomasochistic retard
Bloody, horny, and strapped in
Wrapped in fetish gear of cowskin
Unwanted humans food for carnivorous gimp
Rotted remnants and leftovers
Victim now a bloated flesh blimp
Blackened and purple from decay
Fetishistic sex acts with the dead
Dying from shock and being chained to the rot
Kicking and screaming and slipping in slop
Humanity is the stench that fills your nostrils
Release the gimp

Empowered to enslave
Instructed to degrade, the burden of victory
The bloodlust of a generation
Blood on my hands
Mercy for the weak
Judgement incomplete
My vanity shields me
Monitored to issue control
Widespread propaganda
Masked hidden agendas
Our eyes receive, but can't perceive their lies

Get to the choppa
Now our escape begins
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out of here
Don't let them stop you
Don't let them hold you back
This is our chance
We all must go, dead or alive
Oh yeah bring it!
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out
I've watched you kill my friends
But we've got more guns left
I'm gonna get backup
Then come shoot you in the face
Yeah, that's right
Shoot you in the face
I'm gonna get backup and shoot you in the face
No more escaping
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out of here now
Get to the choppa
Get to the choppa
Get to the choppa
Get to the choppa
Get to the choppa
Get to the choppa

I walk through the ruins haunted by the past
Reminders of my fear
The memories of pain stay here to last
They will not disappear
The walls reflect the echoes of my screams
Sound goes on and on
The trial keeps recurring in my dreams
Reality has gone
No hope
Just tears
Inside the ministry
No hope
Just fears
A silent tear shed in a lonely hell
Accompanied by hate
Forgotten years spent in a prison cell
No witnesses to tell
The walls reflect the echoes of my screams
Sound goes on and on
The trial keeps recurring in my dreams
Reality has gone
No hope
Just tears
Inside the ministry
No hope
Just fears
Split personality
Forced to conformity
Destroyed by brutality
Unfit to reality
Quest for identity
I walk through the ruins haunted by the past
Reminders of my fear
The memories of pain stay here to last
They will not disappear

Idle chatter sounds much better to the absent mind. Govern me, kill thy master. You will not enslave me. The root is bitter but the fruit is sweet but not exempt from criticism. Small pox friendship, you die I take. You are the new slave. Don't call me God because I don't have a disease. What is cold to you is love to me. Savior seething rolling you in. Cherub in red said there's nothing to see here. Hallowed be who art in heaven. I refuse to call that fucker by name.

A change was made today, somehow the reason got lost along the crooked way.
This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made,
remain still and enjoy the ride, right into your goddamn graves...
Seeking so desperatly for nothing at all, tasting every drop of rain.
Without daring to look, you're turning every stone.
Generation cold and dead...
Move on in and let them forcefeed the weak, the divine gets them on their knees.
You preach about doomsday, you differ from me.
Shoot it in, this is what they seek, the divine gets them on their knees.
You give them hope, I just set them free - Your truth is not for me.
This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made.
Stand still, obey them now, remain without a single sound...

Hey I want your skin to get me off
You make it sound so fucking pure
I'll bring you down and make you scream
Take in what you once thought was hate
And now I want to make it right
And you can't take that away from me
Strive to make you cower like a pig
Sit and squirm in your own stink
You have been the sickest of them all
Gone back to the way it never worked
Did you want me to mistreat you
Did you want me to pretend

I'm standing on a ledge cold and naked
Will someone come and offer me their help
Sometimes I forget my medication
Sometimes I forget to pray
I'll make it through this fuckin' day
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Count to ten and then I unwind it
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
I'm wearing out my skin I'm under pressure
Pressure makes me burn it makes me ache
Sometimes I want to burn the things that make me
Sometimes I stop myself too late
It's written all cross my face
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Count to ten and then I unwind it
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
Wired, wired
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone
This is how I live
I never have to justify my actions
Scathing rhetoric my saving grace
Sometimes I really think that it's too noisy
Sometimes I have to hit myself
Words can kill as well as help
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Count to ten and then I unwind it
I'm unconscious, drunk and blinded
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
Wired, wired
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone
This is how I live
You can't touch me, ever
Fear burns at my touch
Standing on a ledge will you come and help
Will you burn yourself, would you help me then
Fear burns at my touch, in its wake
An ugly jagged scar across your face
I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious, I'm
Unconscious
Count to ten, I'm unconscious
Take a deep breath and then I unwind it
Wired, wired
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, this is how I
How I live, how I live, how I live, how I live
I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, I'm in a zone, this is how I live

Cleaving away at any extremity, From his torso his appendages are ripped,
Another pass of my chainsaw, And his leg is disjoined at the hip, Cutting with
my shoulder blade, His forearm I lustily seize, Bit by bit deconstructing his
demise, Allowing my victim no piece... Limb from limb... Dislimbing my victims
for my collection of severed and rotting keepsakes, Trophies for my room
displayed in mylar on decorative platters and stakes, Once in possession of
the fleshy sinewy gew gaws that I demand, Only these quadrapalegic cadavers
are left to give me a hand... Limb from limb... Taking her hand and arms and
legs, She is left looking quite stumped, Collecting the body parts that I
greedily hoarde, The torso is callously dumped, Her grevious wounds spill
precious ichor, Upon the makeshift abatoir's floor, But the sacrifice is not
made in vein, Donating her arms to the poor... Limb from limb, mercilessly
taking people for an arm and a leg, Limb from limb, an unscrupulous bargain
upon which you cannot reneg, Limb from limb, I have so many, but I always
hanker for more, Limb from limb, at times it's impossible to get a foot in the
door... Limb from limb... You must hand it to me as I split you at the seams,
I always get a leg up on my victims, your ensanguined projections I glean,
Jigsawed without hope of reassembly, I take what's yours as mine, You watch as
your existence slips away, your losing it one piece at a time...

Ride the wind
My aggressions mirrored themselves in her eyes
As the blade was ripping up her insides
Her eyes
Stabbing and stabbing
My love fell dead to the floor
Together with sheds of my sanity
Dead in the absence of agony
She's still here with me
As Hell turns to ice
Her dead eyes staring deep into my soul
Into the carved out hole
Sweeping forth, the wind without no name
My mind is raped by insanity
Now her blood flows in my veins
Her heart beats in my chest
Her voice screams within my mind
The wind without no name
Ride the wind
Now time itself touches my soul
It's ice cold breath in my ear
Oh, "God" I'm sorry, I lost control
I slayed love disguised as fear
The fire still burns within my soul
No wind to put it out
Now time itself touches my soul
It's ice cold breath in my ear
Oh, "God" I'm sorry, I lost control
I slayed love disguised as fear

We lie awake and try to reason why
These people treat us so unkind
Just want to taste the freedom one more time
Just want to leave it all behind
We sneak down the hallway, it's time for us to go
It's time for them to let us be
So close to heaven, I can almost see the light
A few more steps and we'll be free
Leave it all behind
Breaking out in silence
As we crawl beneath the gate
Run, run so much fun
Doesn't it feel great
Over the wall, the great escape
We pledge you this and vow
That you'll never, ever catch us
You'll never get us now
Breathing hard, we got to get away
Never going back to yesterday
Run and hide from the enemy
But you can't stop the both of me
Racing through the darkness
Ad we slice into the night
There's no one here to challenge us
Our freedom's now in sight
But something moves around us
They've seen through our disguise
Flashing lights surround us
They begin to multiply
Siren's wall, they're right behind us
But I know what to do
It's time for us to say good bye
Time to split in two
Returning there is not an option
We've never going back
You cage us like an animal
Prepare for the attack

Take my fingers and take my hands
Save me from myself, selfish distractions
Board the windows and lock all doors
Save me from my flaws, misguided solutions
I'm always walking on the easiest path
And I know that road, it leads to nothing
Aligned my footsteps and led me to the route
That you've laid for me, ready and waiting
Why have I turned my back so many times
On a clear direction?
Why have I listened to the whispers
That are from the dark
Take my fingers and take my hands
And save me from myself, selfish distractions
Board the windows and lock all doors
Save me from my flaws, misguided solutions
It never seems to matter how many times
That I fail on my own convinced that I'm stronger
Your gentle hand is reaching leading me safely away
From the dark, the fiction in my mind
Why have I turned my back so many times
On a clear direction?
And once again, I realize that I'm short of the goal
I've wandered so far from where I should be
I've led myself astray for what?
For comfort? There is no comfort here
Carry me home, carry me home
There is no [Incomprehensible] comfort here
Take my fingers and take my hands
And save me from myself, selfish distractions
Board the windows and lock all doors
And save me from my flaws, misguided solutions

Complete lower digestive prolapse
Volvulized intestines-squeezed feces attack
Shit bleeds through perforations
An indication for colostomy experimentation
Colostomization of torso and extremities
New breed of feces bleeding disease

Blurs of beauty have passed me by
Scenes have flashed inside my mind
Remembered places in memory alive
Forever moving onward
An endless space within you are
Black hopeless hole, feelings are sparse
Seems your goal is gone, devotion wanders far
Take a look back on your past
Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel
An aimless search through latent realms
The warmth is lost, cold beings dead
Affection fatal, love bonded to a bed
Release your inner self
Time is sacred until it ends
Never to stop, so cleanse your head
Relax in peace; I'll be happily content
Waiting to fulfill your fate
Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear that you still feel
The conclusion
Provoke the end, don't wait
Resolution
Do it now, rearrange
Discontinue
And make the change

I've always searched for an answer for my convinctions
A troubled mind at 15,demonic visions,
I saw you raped and beaten thrown down like a rag.
Who the hell is this monster that surrounds my brain?
I try to make some sense of this,try to break this mold.
Divination a power I wish I didn't have.
Now I wake with sweat and blood,scars of you dad.
I wake from this nightmare to find its the truth.
Tell me now father,what did we do?
I'll never understand your actions...never speak to you.
Don't try and correct your mistake.
Fake fucker,fake father die.

Satan - angel of darkness carry me
Through the seventh gate.
Take me to the regions of evil, let your
Flames surround my soul.
I have given you my mortal life I wear
Your marks with pride.
You were the razor in my flesh now take
My blackened soul.
Enrich me with the powers of evil.
Let me stand by your throne.
Let me become a soldier of darkness.
For you I'll raise my sword.
In my heart your black flame burns.
My eyes are cold as death my blood is rivers of hate.
I am the very essence of evil!
Evil!
Your wings will carry me through the darkened skies.
Far beyond the realms where light no more shines.
My eyes reflect your flame.
Forever I will remain.

All my thoughts are unfocused.
Help me focus the distorted - my
Conscious span is spun all my thoughts
Unfocused - a collage of thoughts in my
Mind help me focus the distorted -
Conscious span is spun protruding
Exertion of concentration - perception
Corruption is my frustration unbearably
Undecided - undefined and uttered.

Oh pick up flutes and fiddles, a new tune is beginning
A melody forsaken, on the chords of our elders' song
Each note is telling a story, a fragment of existence
Oh people ye who listen, sit down and hear the old man's story
He was standing right in front of me, few steps from where I've been
That day the manor's tower is hiding a sun in agony
Filthy and soiled from head to feet, his sword was rusty and ruined
But in his eyes I caught a fleeting glimpse of his pride
[Bridge:] He said...
"Seven moons painted the skies before I reached for the chosen one
A travel through the starlit horizons, through the magic's way
On the path that leads us to knowledge, a light fall of rites
and believes from past forgotten times
Outshining the malice on our thoughts !
[Chorus:] A story that came from so many miles and years ago
The legend of the magic shield
The elf, the dwarf, the man who carries true faith deep within
Was known by everyone as Oakenshield
I didn't understand the words he said, the silence fell on the scene
A watercolour painted with a thousand shades of feels
A wooden shield tied on his back, the magic wisdom seed
From that day on
[Bridge:] He told...
"From the time when the ancients' glory rules us all, the shield has been
Passed hand in hand to the few, whose hearts are pure and bold
Made with the hardwood of Usdu'm, never
decline his influence on character
Outstanding is the power of our will !
[Chorus:] A story...
[Intermezzo:] Shield, from the sources of our depths
in the universal edge
Declining
Shield, from the wounds in your malice grains
"Face up and take a contact with your inner fears
You will find a well of gloominess and humble damp
Make yourself a trace on walk, the power of become
The enchantment is the magic of being"
[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]
Slowly fades the light, the story slips away
The old man's tired now: doze off!
"Sleep well, keeper of the shield!"
Mankind could never understand,
The shield remains forever only as a:
[Chorus:] A story that came from so many miles and years ago
The legend of the magic shield
The elf, the dwarf, the man who carries true faith deep within
Was known by everyone as Oakenshield

Above my heads mighty men battle
Flashing blades rip through the air
Cracking shields with rumbling thunder
Rolling over the waves
Blood pours like rain onto the sea
As it wind-whipped foams
Warlords in shining helmets
Send men screaming to their death
Clouds of black cover the sea
Day turns into night
Infinite darkness beckons me
No more sun, no more light
Ships tied stern to stern
A battle on the north sea waves
Hearts of braves brightly burn
Berserks swing their metal-blades
Battle hammers hit with force
Crushing helmet coveres heads
Dying men tumble over board
Foaming waves colored red
Memories invade my mind
As my harness brings me down
My bodie's getting cold and numb
As the ocean pulls me down
Above my head my brave friends battle
Their flashing blades rip through the air
Sending men screaming to join me
As I die in these cold north sea waves

The mysteries of a hidden past.
Precession of the planetary relations.
Restitution of a genuine consciousness.
Return to the haven of the first and the last.
The everlasting zero, a glimpse of a million.
The forever million, yet a ubiquitous presence.
Coronate the path of the Gods, the Elder.
Beware, stare towards the horizon new.
Sear, tear the sensation of distant propinquity.
Through the secret moments I flew.
As one among the very few.
The everlasting zero, a glimpse of a million.
The forever million, yet a ubiquitous presence.
Coronate the path of the Gods, the Elder.
Coronate the path of the Gods.
Beware, stare towards the horizon new.
Sear, tear the sensation of distant propinquity
I am a remnant of the forever origin.
I am the soul of every phantom fallen.
I am rising as I am falling, silent as calling.
"The precise prelude of the catalysm".
silent as calling.
Apocalyptic visions of the future fall.
The aberrant taste of the conceiving past.
As a slave of the next moment of presence.
The ones among the very few.
Restitution - summons the sight.
Emancipation - circles in presence.
Renunciation - for a new era to enlighten.

I can't get rid of you
I don't know what to do
I don't even know who is growing on who
'cause everywhere I go you're there
Can't get you out of my hair
Can't pretend that I don't care, it's not fair
I'm being punished for all my offenses
I want to touch you but I'm afraid of the consequences
I want to banish you from whence you came
But you're part of me now
And I've only got myself to blame
You're really growing on me
(or am I growing on you)
You're really growing on me
(or am I growing on you)
Any fool can see
Sleeping in an empty bed
Can't get you off my head
I won't have a life until you're dead
Yes you heard what I said
I want to shake you off but you just won't go
And you're all over me but I don't want anyone to know
That you're attached to me, that's how you've grown
Won't you leave me, leave me, leave me alone
You're really growing on me
(or am I growing on you)
You're really growing on me
(or am I growing on you)
Any fool can see
You're really growing on me
(or am I growing on you)
You're really growing on me
(or am I growing on you)

Stalking - your home seems so secure
Waiting - until the time is right
I see the light in your daughters room
I want to taste her fear and I want to rip her flesh
The time has come for me to enter your suburban dwelling
Excitement in my mind, explosions, my veins are swelling
Unwelcomed guest, you're not expecting me
An unlocked window, I enter silently
I make my way, slowly up the stairs,
creeping in where, your parents rest their heads.
Two steel spikes, will stake them to their bed,
writhing in pain, white sheets now dripping red
Your parents now disposed of, we can be alone,
I burst into your bedroom you can not be found.
I faintly hear you whimper from the corner of the room,
frozen stiff with fear, now the fun begins
I rip off your night-dress, expose your naked flesh
Throw you to the cold floor gnawing off your breasts
With fingers deep inside of you I rip your virgin skin
You tear apart so easily, bleeding from within
I now tear chunks of hair out and then bite off your nose
It's not to spite your face my dear,
it's how it fucking goes
You cry and scream in silence and then your bowels give way
Handfuls of your body waste I slam into your face
Gagging on excrement I give you one last kiss
My hand on your crotch, your labia I rip
Our play-time is now over, I must be on my way
Good night my darling angel, pray you do not wake

Skin absorption, mystical poison.
Vanished life, bequeathed.
Knock on coffin, shallow burial.
Emerge enslaved, commands obeyed.
Vision in the shroud, effect of curare.
Silence gives consent, killing which you bear.
Face rivers of tears - slave to kill.
Slow grab for soil - uncontrollable will.
Moving the earth - arising from the ground.
Choking unpleasantness - a gurgling sound.
Staggering around, catatonic hellish dance.
Animation fades, into hypnotic trance.
Held back from the gorge, your spirit bound in chains.
Death cannot be reached, (with the) curare in your veins.
Homage to your master, destiny controlled.
Sorrow at your fate, no feelings felt, this story untold.

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that i'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Life, at its best, you are doing fine
But you're blind, it's china you hold
As it breaks, suddenly it's clear
Beautiful but transitory
But we won't break easy
We won't give in to all unbearable pain
We'll pull through, we won't crack
We'll endure and survive
Oh, transitory
Pain is as life itself
Evanescent as it fades
Transitory
Life, all you've got, all was swept away
Now you see what there is to miss
Suddenly you're stronger than you thought
As you know it's transitory
'Cause we won't break
Survival is all we've got
And our unbearable grief
We'll hold on and won't crack
And we'll value all life
Oh, transitory
Pain is as life itself
Evanescent as it fades

Tears from the eyes so cold,
tears from the eyes, in the grass so green.
As I lie here, the burden is being lifted
once and for all, once and for all.
Beware of the light,
it may take you away, to where no evil dwells.
It will take you away, for all eternity.
Night is so beautiful
(we need her as much as we need Day).

Blood
Filth
Corruption
Poverty
No solution
Can you see?
Can you see?
It comes around
Stress
Depression
Rage
Pain
Self-destruction
Can you see?
Can you see?
It comes around
Hard work every day for nothing
Other people get easily everything
I'm not envy, I'm just angry
I am angry
I am fucking angry!
Tear apart
Tear apart
Hard work every day for nothing
Other people get easily everything
I'm not envy, I'm just angry
I am angry
I am fucking angry
Tear apart
Tear apart
Inside

Finally the storm arrives
Our wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won
Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our minds hard as steel
And before the dying day
We will have you kneel
The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed god
He will claim the dead
Under winter skies
We stand glorious
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious
No retreat
No remorse
Victory
Will be ours
Blood on steel
Sacrifice
Victory
Will be ours
Under winter skies
We stand glorious
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is won!

Satan fertile
Woman's egg
Need to cut
Her own skin
Son of Satan
Within womb
Need to cut
Her own skin
With a razor
Spells a word
Within the chest
A single word
Carved in deep
Through the skin
Bleeds the word
Satanic blood

Under (the) moon, spring time still to come
"If I keep questing, I may find some settling!"
Jack-in-the-Green show me your droll face of wood
Look around at the frightened faces
One man speaks, loud and loud he cries
"All those strange fellows must go away to barrows!"
Then they all went for a riot indeed
Torch in hand and angry glances
[Bridge:]
Here is Jenny Greenteeth, twelve miles from the nearest inn
(the) innkeeper speaks of filthy tricks, she's as old as trees!
- be aware - As old as trees!
[Chorus:]
Nighttime - never they say, go off alone
In their tracks I walk - A dreadful strain
Their homes so hidden, through branches old they wait
No gold nor silver, twiggy arms don't want your gold....!
In the end, the circle's close at hand
Living more gently, let's have a glass of brandy
Never they saw their home's door open at night
Stars witness their silent traces
[Bridge:]
Here is Dana o'Shee, she's dwelling by to take revenge
Empty a jug of whitest milk over her head!
- she'll pass away - Over her head!
[Chorus:]
Nighttime - never they say, go off alone
In their tracks I walk - A dreadful strain
Their homes so hidden, through branches old they wait
No gold nor silver, fear is sold at half price....!
[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]
[Chorus x 2]

Oh spiritus, oh sanctus
Adoramus domine
Te deum laudamus
In memoriam, gloriam
Warriors immortal knights
We walk our way alone
Eternally, we're born to write
The sign of victory
Warriors, immortal knights
So far away from home
Eternally, we're born to fight
Forever riding free
And the day has come
Time to die
Somewhere far beyond
On the stairway to the sky
On the rainbow soaring high
We are born from the sun
In our hands we hold the future
As we live so we will die
Carry on to save mankind
Back to back we stand as one
Until the last crusade is done
We're leaving from the night
Call for vengeance, raise your steel
We are the kinghts on our glory ride
Law defenders, raise your swords
Freedom for us all
Hail to the gods of creation
Hail to the king of the world
A hail to the metal invasion
A heavenly kingdom on earth
Godless odysee, endless agony
We're heading for eternal life

You were born but you don't know why you're existing
You are enabled why is it you and not me
Your parents they're shocked but still they love you
You are their flesh and blood what else could they do
Not even modern medicine can help your tortured body
Hospitals are your world, doctors your friends
To keep your dreadful life
Other people never treat you like a normal human being
They often think you shouldn't be a part of their sick society
They smile at you but deep inside they think you shouldn't be here
Because they never ever realize, you got a heart and feelings too
People turn their heads
Whenever you walk by
Because they believe
You live a life without sense
Life without sense
Life without sense
If I'd be you, I might to commit suicide
But you're strong enough to live on
Because it's you and not me
If I'd be you, I might to commit suicide
But you're strong enough to live on
Because it's you and not me
People turn their heads
Whenever you walk by
Because they believe
You live a life without sense
Life without sense
Life without sense

war - where we go, where we hide, where we turn

when the seed will understand

when we scream your name again

The black house in in my street
looks too dark just to go inside
But when I do
I cannot move because of
the mess in the hallway
The picture on the wall is chaotic
I don't want to look at it
But when I do
I cannot speak because of
the confusion in my head
I am unfit and I want to leap away
But when I do
The red colour comes after me
It is fierce and it moves slow
The picture on the wall is chaotic
I don't want to look at it
But when I do
I cannot speak because of
the confusion in my head

There's a search for you you were wished away
Pissing off fathers that you paid
He waived the cross it flew in the wind
Now he's looking looking, looking away
Now feel the loss of energy
Feel it till you hear the devil call your name
I feel the same you'll feel the same
The ripping of your skin will make you run away
I feel the same you'll feel the same
Till you hear the devil call your name
Now he searched for God and
He found the way but the road just burned away
The lights go dim and your so called God
Is now looking, looking away now
Feel the loss of energy
Feel it till you hear the devil call your name
Are you still alive I'm still alive
You just cant hear me
I feel the same the devil calls your name

Had we known then what we know
Now you would be alive
Forgive us, it felt like a prison to lead
Predestined lives without a choice
If you could see her now you would be so proud
Is it murder? Dear Martyr
You brought your own demise
Things were better without questions
Only your answers to guide us
Fallen are the great ones
You fell fucking far
Killing you sooner, would have been better
Dear departed, feasting on faith's fat was comforting
The yoke's released
The blindfold's drawn
No, please don't do it

If I could know the way this ends
I'd then understand
I'll live What it is to be made from the best of you
Let my hands make movement for hearts of the tested few
If I could know the way (?)
The way this ends
I'd then understand
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
I'd see the glory in these hands
I'm placing stone upon stone
But this castle is falling faster than my hands
They gained the west wall
Fall back to the stables
Prepare for the last stand
I end here you start now
Like iron sharpens iron
I will make you better
You will make me my best
Like sea salt to my skin (to my skin)
Without you I am but a tasteless man
If I could know the way (?)
The way this ends
I'd then understand
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
I'd see the glory in these hands
This is end this is end
This armor weighs but I will fight till I face the sky
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way (?)
The way this ends
I'd then understand
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
I'd see the glory in this

It's all been done before and
No one can listen to anyone's answers
They're drifting farther everyday
And they say
"We hold our hands to block the sun
We blame the light for what we've done
We look away so We'll forget what We've become"
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World
When the night falls you know who you are
And you cast reflections as the mirror gathers rust
"It's so safe and lonely with you"
Lovers ripping in two
Grind away 'till nothing's left
There's nothing left inside
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World
Your lives will fade before their time
And you'll never say goodbye
The end of all the things you know
And all of what you can be
It's fading fast before you
What we want, we are

Screaming day and night at the dark-forboding walls
Lights dim before me and enthralls all
I'll always look the same in this cold, forsaken dark
Teach me to drip own tears
For the pain of other's hearts
Not the essence, but the woe of mankind
To weep within my crying
Root the strength of love and hatred
Let blood flow in purest red
Root the angels' rage into my soul
Let it grow
There is something infidel that's gonna happen today
Be the witness, now and ever, abandoned angel of decay
The obscurity's curtain I paint as the blind
Life's tumult in the free fall
The ghouls chasing its trace
Oh, dreams, here ended all
Is there something in us all
That can last forever?
I feel the strange penetrating my fibres
Mocking at my vacant sferes
Body parts cut cold evolving to a rotting culture
A death in its plenitude!!!

Scourged through searing
Incandescence
Melt together
Fire torture brings me intense pain
Predestined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Blowtorch slaughter
Bodily capitulation
Blowtorch slaughter
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Predestined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Conflagration through my veins
Desensitized, charring skin, burnt within,
branded soul, torrid cruelty
Dwindle away, glowing heat to mutilate
Head set ablaze, consumed in flames
I burn to the ground
Blowtorch slaughter
Predestined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Fire torture takes me to my end

I've been taken from your arms so many times,
I've felt this before,
The sheets are tangled,
And they don't feel right on my carcass like you do,
This is my revenge,
And this is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
(Gin-gin-gin)
I feel dead, I feel dead inside,
I feel dead, I feel so fucking dead,
I feel dead,
I, feel so dead,
Last night, we dressed to our best,
And drank till there was nothing left,
I walked you home, you held my hand,
We fucked away the rest of the night,
Take my hand,
For this is my revenge,
This is your demise,
For every second lost,
I
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my
This is my revenge,
This is my
(For every second sleep has stole)
And sweetie, I've got to say,
That I'm really not worth the time of your day,
I guess when we left each other for the first time,
We didn't think "goodbye" would be our new favorite line

The venom inside.
Turned me into the enemy
Turned into what I hate
My apathy got the best of me
Blood boiled and lost my way
I never thought I'd be the one to blame
Have to live with constant shame
Everything that I put inside
Just to feel numb
I tried to escape
Push it away
Tried to hide
The venom inside
This was nothing but moral abuse
Guess I just needed something new
What could I gain from solitude?
Or acting like a fool?
I tried to escape
Push it away
Tried to hide
The venom inside
I tried to escape
Push it away
Tried to hide
The venom inside
Disconnected, Apathetic
It's so pathetic to be this frantic
I needed help! I needed help!
Like methadone for an addict
I tried to escape
Push it away
Tried to hide
The venom inside

Potentially there's no safety
Inside these walls, I'm forced to be
Unprotected to cruelty
I'm not at my own mercy
The most important time in my life
Is governed by an unstable mind
On another I depend
My own life I can't defend
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
Incarcerated and force-fed
Your disparity a constant threat
Are you qualified to reign?
Is my destruction pre-ordained?
I am not a parasite
Will I be punished by your spite?
I await my destiny
And possibly your enmity
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
Completely under your dominion
I'm not here of my own volition, no
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
I'm locked away, a nonentity
Sacrificed by antipathy
My pleas aren't heard
So I'm tortured
It's perilous in this domain
And I'm dead if I remain
I pray that you
Don't cause my doom...
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore

Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times
Time decides what lives or dies
Time can crawl and time can fly
It can wither and erase
It can make a new beginning
There is nothing time can't beat
There is nothing time will need
To destroy and bloom again
A vicious circle older than the earth
Decay, destroy to reform again
Withering time
Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times
Broken windows, blistering paint
Lashing winds, hot suns and rain
Wood has splintered, walls are cracked
The elements are just as vicious
All what men have made won't last
In the future as in the past
But our memories are strong
And will outlive all circles of time
Time, transcend beyond all life, transcend beyond
On until the end of time, on and on
Live before we waste our time, before we run out
Broken, blistering, lashing, splintering
Cracking, crawling, flying, withering time
Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times

Gaze at the leaving clairvoyant
Predicting invasions and pain
A child cansee through the stranger...
The Watcher's eye, the noble liar
It's time for the merchant and his help for sale...
Blades to cut wicked flesh
On a merchantman he counts his money
Then he sails away
The sea he'll cruise is blood and fire
Oh father I can't see a lane
They make you a pawn in the game
For we all are deaf, dumb and blind
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chains
When you're off to the hall of the serpent
See the cynic who's counting his gold
While gun runners, priests and clairvoyants
Are dancing around the rising demon
You are taught to eat up all the crap they shit
Parading your nuts on a silver plate
Kill your brother by the blade they sell
For you don't unite
They reap your bondage sowing evil
There's no use to tell what I've seen
They know how to make you believe
Just what they want you to know
[repeat chorus/ solo: Jens/both/Jens/both]
Tears of a mandrake - yeah...
[solo: Jens/Both]
[repeat chorus]
Drown in the tears of the mandrake
Pawn in the game - Drown in the tears of a mandrake

The language of the lie
Barbed and callous tongues shall lick
Behind the thinnest doors
A web of falsehood so unfolds
Humility
Pride dissected maliciously
A mockery
Bonds dissolve in endless mimickery
Cruelly illuminated the subject of shallow spectacle
Inherent weaknesses revealed
Contact withers to a lull
Once perfect pictures now stained with fingerprints
Tragedy fucks jealousy
The human heartstrings bend and break
Vultures with human eyes, can you feel them circling?
Preying on tender moments
The failures of purest dream
Our selfish means are the means to this fucking end
A knife for every spine of every man
Nails scratching into the flesh until fibers are broken
Something's got to give
The bottoms of bottles no longer ease the pain
And the bathroom mirror reflects the face of autonomy
Man must invert
Internalize the pain
The sequence replays in the mind
The human heartstrings bend and break
Vultures with human eyes, can you feel them circling?
Preying on tender moments
The failures of purest dream
Our selfish means are the means to this fucking end
A knife for every spine of every man
Away a lot ugly answers lie somewhere in between
Intrinsic disregard and the burden of weakness
They're sharpening
The knives are always sharpening
A life now stained with fingerprints
Something's got to give!

You, in this imagery - You see people from various ranks dancing - Consider what is human nature: nothing more than meat for worms - I am the proof: myself lying here - I was once a crowned man - This way you'll be the good and the evil - People from any rank: you'll be given to worms.

Dead skin weathered
Lifeless and torn
The eyes sewn shut
And tongue from the mouth
She lay bleeding
Scarlet stains
Ripped out the stitches
His hands blasphemy

Another place of loneliness
Where I keep sorrow
in my heart
When I can feel the last kiss
of fate
Like snakebite
Nothing to hate
No one can stop
my sadness
Things that I say
Don't need the revelation
Now break the silence,
forget your shame
Don't try to run away
from your pain
With bloody hunger,
inside my chest
I drawn in midnight world
It's my guest
I wandered lonely as
a cloud
I've got the time to think,
to find
I see wet fingers of the rain
By my side
Nothing to hate
No one can stop my
sadness
Things that I say
Don't need the revelation
Now break the silence,
forget your shame
Don't try to run away
from your pain
With bloody hunger,
inside my chest
I drawn in midnight world
It's my guest...

Baby, I get so scared inside, and I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind, or is it fantasy?
Heaven Is in the palm of my hand,
and it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?
Sometimes It's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger
And stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?
Will you ever take me?
No, I just can't take the pain
But would you ever trust me?
No, I'll never feel the same
I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes for me

[Music: Holmlid]
"I can hardly stay conscious any longer
The world darkens all around me
Even the moon and the stars
Cease their last glimmer of light
I take a last gaze upon this world
The valleys, forests and seas
It will all wither away
As the sun slowly fades
Now i don't care any more
It has proven useless to fight
I yield to my fate
I will just die in peace
And welcome the dark embrace
This is a last goodbye...
Farewell..."

I see your face and I don't understand
Why are you sad while in your hand
Everything that you want
Every little part
But I'd like to hide my god
I interrupt your show
When you sell my dreams
My sad and miserable things
Beneath your skin I'm your god
I am proud of my past
I'm a tattoo on your heart
I feel you burnt my lust
You believe in your escape
I know that you're a poisonous snake
I'll stop you by my stake
To commit suicide so you're late
Chorus:
And the tears fall to our head
And I'm standing above your bed
I watch your turbid eyes
Where my past's already died
I see your face and I understand
Why are you sad when I'd defend
Any chance that I've found
To give light to you
You need to decide what we should do
Look behind my mirror
Tell me what you see
I'm sitting there, crying for me
Feel my hand on our skin?
I try to wash your fingerprint
I seek your weakest, bloody wish
My desires sink
I won't leave you alone
My anger's constantly grown
You're feeding me with your pain
I'll break out from your brain
I see myself
In your hand
I'm following you
But I hate this road
I feel inside
My cells are you
You become alive
While I die
I die

Gentlemen and ladies all please lend me your attention
I beg your pardon for my cheek, please join this heathenreel
Strange rules has this dance; suffers from a serious allergy
Reddens and becomes so unkind, when people're
acting just like you
The regal dance's about to start and I am here to tell you
"There's many a slip twixt cup and lip" 'tis something
that could help you
On and on please join the ball, nobody will stop you
The steps they are so simple, look the moon is dancing too
Drink a toast with the wise man, no one will care for you
Let the dances have their go, follow 'till they reach the end
Mind the minstrels they will say you're just another scarecrow
Not a word a single word, not for all the
whole damn world (you say...)
[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot in heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it shall make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin
I came I saw, do not want nothing at all,
do not want to moralise you
Or spitting hateful sentences, just trying to tease
your rudimental pride
"Live and let live" told the wise man, as no one cared for him
From the soil which is now part of..."leaving is so
easier than living" (he says...)
[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot into heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it shall make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin
Bienvenu Mesdames et Messieurs
To the Danse Paien
Please come in and hurry up or
You will miss your turn
[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]
[Chorus (x2):]
Face the truth are you worthy of this honesty filled - celebration!
Another tune bursting forth from the passion that
glides in my veins - can you feel it?
A speaking portrait's in front of me, do you acknowledge yourself? -
who painted you?

you fail me with every fatal crush
you fail me with every abandoned love
you fail me with your inferno fuck me eyes
that burn as fuel for my city and its neon lights
burn bright white line fever take them all
you fail me with your new dead end dream
you fail me with your pill box fantasy
you fail me as love's greatest war
that was never worth
you were never worth fighting for
dying living dying living dying everyday
living dying living dying living everyday
you think you are a poet
in your eyes you are a star
who lives through a fantasy of rising above
you think you're a victim
but you live as a drunk
that has never sacrificed that has never loved
you think you are tragic but i know you are lost
you have walked the fault lines
and you have crossed them all
this world doesn't fight you, you fight yourself
thinking we fail you you fail yourself

The sound of vomiting to my ears' like singing
Now I'm beginning to become erect
With illness I'm obsessed in the beds of the fallen I rest
A fixation amplified the smell here is what I like best
Feverishly combing the buckets of waste
Wrapping myself in the filth ridden sheets
Raping the shells of the comatose
To fulfill my needs
Photographing bedsores
Cultured by my sick neglect
It's more then a job
It's a love for me to walk this close with death
When you hear a flat line
You know surely I'll be near
To when the reaper's sickle is drawn
I am ever aware
I wish I could pull these strings
In death there are finer things
Malpractice forever be my bitter name
How quickly life does fade away
One flip of the rivers man coin
Could send you screaming to your grave
Grief stricken family watches on
Ceaseless prayers for an only son
I'm afraid that nothing can be done
The moment has finally come
The wrath of a God exemplified
To the pearly gates He'll soon arrive
To leave here his husk in this room of white
I'm quivering at thought
Pull the plug I'm begging you
Take the ride to the cold and blue
The reaper's yellowed lichen finger
Aims ever so true
The origins of disease
I have witnessed in my dreams
The flooding of the blackest blood
To quench my fetid needs
I wish I could pull these strings
In death there are finer things
Malpractice forever be my bitter name
I wish I could pull these strings
In death there are finer things

You're all alone, alienated
Figure your thoughts. Do you make it?
We can too, it's in the heart
Set Yourself Apart!
Figurize your views, do you really
Or is it just security?
We can too, it's in the heart
Set Yourself Apart!
Listen... to yourself
8. The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You!
The Joke's On You!
The Joke's On You!
The Joke's On You!
It all started when I went to school
You were playing me as the fool
I laugh
We laugh
I laugh... at you!
Screaming at me, you're wasting my time
Your opinion is not worth a dime
I've been waiting for this day so long
That's why I'm writing this song
I laugh
We laugh
I laugh... at you!
Because The Joke's On You!

They came to her house in the dead of night
They came to take her
Her mother screamed and her father cried
"Let them take her!"
So the poor little bitch is taken as a witch
To the dungeon
There she is stripped and beaten with a whip
Then they raped her
And she liked it
So this is how you fuck with a crucifix
The poor little bitch, well she likes it
So they held her down while they took their turn
They had to break her
Said she was evil and she would burn
Then they raped her
So why does this tale turn you on?
Why does it excite you?
"'Cause we are beasts like the beasts in the wild"
Or more like barnyard pigs
And you like it

If we are eternal souls why should we fear death?
Beings of eternity expressed in the flesh
From dust we are born, to dust we regress
Souls of infinity expressed in the flesh
Source of all creation within your spirit lies
Sings an eternal song, a hymn that never dies
Not created nor destroyed, the end is not the end
When you leave this mortal form life begins again
Life begins again, the end is not the end
Life begins again, the end is not the end
Life begins again, the end is not the end
Again
Source of all creation within your spirit lies
Sings an eternal song, a hymn that never dies

There is a serpent in every Eden
Slick as grease and cold as ice
There is a lie in every meaning
Rest assured to fool you twice
In this age of utter madness
We maintain we are in control
And ending life before deliverance
While countries are both bought and sold
Holy writings hokus-pokus
Blaze of glory and crucifix
Prepried costly credit salvation's
TV-preachers and dirty tricks
Don't trust nobody
It will cost you much too much
Beware of the dagger
It caress you at first touch
O, all small creatures
It is the twilight if the gods
When the foundations to our existence
Begins to crumble one by one
And legislation protects its breakers
And he who was wrong but paid the most won
Even the gods of countless religions
Holds no powers against this tide
Of degeneration because we have now found
That there is no thrones up there in the sky
Run from this fire
It will burn your very soul
Its flames reaching higher
Came this far there is no hold
Oh, all small creatures
It is the twilight if the gods
(Twilight of the gods) [Repeat: x3]

Expose yourself
As being honest living a good Christian life
Pretend to care for the really poor
With your charity they'll survive
TV-shows to raise huge funds
For refugees left to die
Flee from poverty, caused by war
Fought with weapons your provided
The truth, a bunch of lies
The majority believes
Religion a legal way
For murder, as they please
Malnutrition, civil
War millions live in poverty
For your last hope
Give what you can spare, religion means cash.
Creating wars to sell more arms
Buying governments, peace denied
Multinationals don't care for life
Bigger profits is their goal

["this title comes from the british phrase 'at sixes and sevens,' meaning 'at a point of disorder or confusion.' I think a lot of people will be able to relate to these lyrics, which describe a period in my life where everything was in confusion, without direction, and giving up was the easy way out. the moral of the story: 'everything works out in the end if you really want it to!'"]
Disillusioned, self-confusion
Trying to make it through another day
What's it all for, when does it end
There must be another way
Woven webs of intricacy
A life of nothing new
No one here to understand
Pressure's crushing you
Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow
Aggravation deep frustration
I know what I want to do
Motivation is a problem
When it's driven out of you
Emotion, commotion's
Filling up the brain
Direction's null and void
Another drink dilutes the pain
Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow
Sinking fast
Will it last
At sixes and sevens
Pulling through from yesterday
Another day is done
Determination
Self confidence has won
Woven webs of intricacy
Life is full of stress
That can only hinder
New desire to progress
Sixes and sevens
Disorder battles control
Sixes and sevens
Crises overflow
Sinking fast
Will it last
At sixes and sevens

I've watched the days pass one by one until the fall of man
And seen the cynics feed the jaded merely scraps and bones
The kingdom shaken, it's foundation nearly turned to sand
With foolish faith in faulted leaders that I must disown
Now rise again, this darkened heart betrays what I've always held so dear
Now rise again, this darkened heart it bleeds fast for all my family
Now rise again, this darkened heart it bleeds fast for all humanity
Now rise again, this darkened heart condemns my soul
I've laid to rest the false belief of average stock in me
I'll not relent, no average destiny
I'll reach the point where mankind's sins no longer rest in me
A long hard road, this manifest destiny
I will not be held down

Standing here, in the dark of my room
Once again, I am thinking of you
I will miss all the jokes and the smiles
Are you now in a place that you like?
Strugglin' you did spend all your life
Now is time to rest, all pain has died
You have gone away from us, heading for a better life
Beyond this crazy time
[chorus]
Farewell my friend, this is my goodbye
Fly away tonight on a pair of wings of fire
We will meet again, on the other side
In the heart are the words I can't find
Hail to you, this is all I can say
I don't know if you can hear my song
Watch me please from the heaven above
Reach the second star, the second to the right
Straight ahead you sail, 'till the morning light
Far beyond this world you go, heading for a better life
Where all is good and quiet
[chorus]

Damage to my head, peace stays in the bed
Making love the only thing we can do
Otherwise in our lives, all we do is fight
Never stop enough to call a truce
The only time that you find satisfaction is in our physical play
You love me in the course of the evening but so bitter in the day
Think you'd wipe the smudge, but just carry on the grudge
Nothing gets forgiven from you
Soon I'll lose the cure, and you'll thirst so much more
Somebody fresh I wonder who
Now I think it's time for me to walk straight out the door
And leave you here
But my pride hurts too much for that you
Wouldn't even shed a tear
Got to pack my bags, and leave behind the past
Living with you was worse than hell
Still I feel blue, and I wonder do you
With the look on your face you could never tell
Never thought I'd wish somebody death or I'd feel so much hate
Hopefully you'll get what you deserve and be stricken by fate
I hope that you, you get what you want
That's right
Ahhrrrghh!!!

[woman crying] Oh my god [still crying] Don't leave me I can here them whisper my name [Monoxide Child:] I can feel them watch me every now and again I watch him float along the clouds Hunt for blood stains My souls almost out And he can only see the pain Wings spread on a porch I sit Conversatin with the devil on some shit I feel the spirts rise When the black birds fly Only the crows know why When its time to die [Shaggy 2 Dope:] 12 o' clock on the dot My blood runs cold On my window Got me in a choke hold Visions of death pinicle sacrafice And the ultimate price of taking my own life Beady yellow eyes see right through me The black crow takes my thoughts Talking to me, the beyond consumes me And plants seeds The black crow plants his feet and over sees [Chorus:] Our father of Shangri-La Halo be thy name If the world turns over Save me from the fire rain Keep me pure keep me clean As the Lotus grows I ask ye for forgiveness Keep me from the crows Balck feathers black eyes black wings [Jamie Madrox:] Perched atop the cemetery gateing Waiting for me, recording my moves Used to be one, now there are two And bring me back to the one in control A couple waiting to pick at my soul The faster I run they still give chase Will they leave me if I reveal my Holy Cross face Black blood within the raven [Violent J:] Have I been forgaven? A haven of crows watching skwaking Drifting above me, hawking What lies beneath it's eyes When the red moon bleeds Who's guideing it as it flys It feeds, forfilling it's needs [Chorus x2] In my mark for death Do they want my last breath [Monoxide Child:] Do they really want me dead So my soul will reserrect I can't help it praying to the god above Purify change the crows to doves [Shaggy 2 Dope:] Wings spread out and they cover my soul Deaths voice springs out And spreads threw my mentals In threw my mind And down my spine [Violent J:] Midnight, sunrise, sunfall Crows beckon, pharohs call My blood hot dripping Growing clipping, snipping I will never be afraid [Jamie Madrox:] In my trench coat pocket Of the eyes of the dead There's a severed crows head I look down his neck To see what he can see I've finally come to grips They will always be around me [Chorus x2]

For so long have travelled, I have fought
Now the road is at an end
I've climbed the highest mountains
Seen the sea beyond the hills, I'm alone with a dream
I have to go
Release all my bonds
Forever I'll search
Oh, I can't go on, the last drop of my strength
Silently falls to the ground
No, I just can't break, I have to keep on going to the end
I am alone with a dream
I have to go
Release all my bonds
Forever I'll search
For my own dream
Now I hope to see what
What I will become
If I see with my own eyes
This is my time
To overcome my fears
Doubt has me in its grasp
I must believe that my wish
Will come true in the end
It has to end
I've fought my own thoughts
I have struggled to keep my head clear
I have vanquished the night
Clouding my sight now I know
Now I know...
For so long I have journeyed, I have strayed
Now the road is at an end
Now all my bonds
Are gone, I'm released
Forever I'll search
I've my own dream
Now I can see what
What I have become
I see with my own eyes
Now it's my time
No longer drowned by fear
No, there isn't any doubt
I just believed that my wish
Would come true in the end
This is my end

Deep down the line
sleep save my child
trains leave and come
sad dreams ain't long {they said}
And they dream tonight
I always wanted the war
and they sleep tonight
dying in yearning for more
Deep down the spine
sleep save my child
loves leave and come
all is said and done
And they dream tonight
I always wanted the war
and they sleep tonight
dying in yearning for more

In depression down
I'm falling
down in the oblivion deep
My mind, my force, my power
seen to be unreal
The death like air I'm breathing
wares my fear
my fear
Descends with the night
the growing delusion
of live
I feel like be unworth
of living
depression shines on me
As a child
under her guide
I feel my blood
flowing out of my veins
Sister blade help me find
The right way to an higher side
Finally I've found
the higher of side
As the blade
ends this life
I feel a sense
of satisfied thirst
I'm free
is like flying
this death
on my own

By the powers vested in me
By the entity of choice
I pronounce myself dead
At 4:18 am
I am gathered here
To remember the deceased within me
Last flames of the dying sun
Will burn my world
Creating a starless universe
Awaiting the kingdom come
And for rebirth of angels
I sacrifice this earth
Lowered into the grave
My empty casket
So I can rest in peace
Self created funeral
Will finally purify
By this burial
The stains in me

(lyrics: E. Holopainen)
(music: E. Holopainen, T. Koivusaari & J. Rechberger)
We sail across the sea,
In our thoughts we float over mountains
All this vanity that we could hide
The truth
The truth is to be alive
and to live your life in fear by hate
and create our own gods
We all ourselves are created
our own images
Ourselves we are created
our own gods
In the misty morning
When the sun is rising,
When the whole sky is red like blood
Man can realize the real meaning of life
to love and respect your life
Your salvation,
or is just your damnation.
We all ourselves...

Struck is now the Sun, he's bleeding so hard
And tainting the sky, with this brand-new red dawn
Now slowly he just fades, fading into the night
Ravashed by the darkness, the dusk's purest of lights
Blood is now spattered, across the whole dark sky
Dusk shall now wash it, with darkness and with night
I watch him perish now, I see his slow demise
And smile toward the Heavens, for this great gift of thine
Thou art the one true queen
Mistress of the night
Sun's bloody slayer
His one true fright
Above the howling stars
Above the fiery Hell
You reign most supreme
With yours, the crystal stream
You, who now slaughter the day, and send your pale beams
Of madness and of pain, On ours, the feeble minds
Your sweet heavenly figure, as pale as the white bone
Lights through the black darkness, of the long sattered throne

In the depths of an evil mind
Hearing cries of demented thoughts
The anger is strong and the body turns to steel
The aggression is on!
Suicide haunts the ghost of... DEATH
Metal shield protects the demons of... HATE
In his mind lies a guilt
Tormentor without remorse
AGGRESSOR, AGGRESSOR
AGGRESSOR, AGGRESSOR
Pain and destruction is the rule he must..OBEY
Getting orders from the spirits of the... DEAD
In his mind lies a guilt
Tormentor without remorse
AGGRESSOR, AGGRESSOR
AGGRESSOR, AGGRESSOR
Clutching his fists for he prepares to get his prey
He will die a man without a grave
In his mind lies a guilt
Tormentor without remorse
(SOLO)
AGGRESSOR, AGGRESSOR
AGGRESSOR, AGGRESSOR
Pre...pare... to... be... killed!

burn the bed
consummated
rest the head
it just holds us back now
still she keeps on looking
of course [2x]
nows theres nothing I hate as much
wet the lips
shut your pretty mouth
use the kiss
tommorrow fails to exist
still she keeps on looking
of course [2x]
now theres nothing I
it all surfaces in this light
words under my breath
taking my time
breaking your smile
feed the wish
let it flourish
head for shore
let me haunt you
still she keeps on looking
now theres nothing I hate as much [2x]
I will sleep
(It all surfaces in this light)
throughout the infection
fast asleep
where nothing can find me
words under my breath
taking my time
breaking your smile
everyone goes away
I cant even try
I watched you slip away

Intruder alert continues to flirt
And stagger and trip up my life
The sinister thoughts unfairly rots
My brain can't put up a fight
Oh, the nightmare
Can it be put to an end?
The fact is I know
I'm not dreaming again
Steel on my skin
Oh, carve with that knife
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Mentally, physically draining my skull
Of every thought entering
(How)
Feelin' just like a voodoo doll
About to be struck by a pin
Oh, the threshold
Comes to a staggering halt
Even though the guilty
Don't know it's his fault
Steel on my skin
Oh, carve with that knife
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Oh, the knifes dug in
Carving my life
Oh the life is him
Overflowing amount of impatience
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis a crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
I'm losing it,
Crisis of life
Crisis of life

I live like a cockroach
In a basement wet and cold
Maybe, I'll never know
If there's life at the surface
I guess, I'm doomed for life
To spend it in this shelter
Fall out blocks the sun
For the years to come
The fires raged on and on
Then the winter came moving on
It's cold and dark living underground
Buried alive by a nuclear blast
Fire scorching earth
There was nowhere to run
Then the storms they would howl
Blowing black snow, blowing death around
I look into your eyes
The X-ray shining through
Claustrophobic madness
Kill your beloved, killing everyone
At the dawn of a new age
The age of quarrel
And the age of quarrel
Turned into the age of ice
The fires raged on and on
The winter came moving on
It's cold and dark living underground
Buried alive by a nuclear blast
I live like a cockroach
In a basement wet and cold
Maybe I'll never know
If there's life at the surface
Guess, I'm doomed for life
To spend it in this shelter
Fall out blocks the sun
For the years to come
At the dawn of a new age
The age of quarrel
And the age of quarrel
Turned into the age of ice

TIME STANDS STILL IN CANTERVILLE
FOR AGES THIS CURSE LAYS UPON
PASS THE NIGHT WALKING FOR FOURHUNDRED YEARS
LONGING FOR THIS LIAISON
THE BARREN ALMOND ONCE SHED THE LEAVES
THE SPLENDOUR HAS CRUMBLED AWAY
THIS HARM WAS DONE AND THE GREEN-EYED ONE
ONCE IT HAD LED HIM ASTRAY
[PRE-CHORUS]
HERE IN THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT
LET A WILLING EAR ROAM
AND FAR INTO THE NIGHT
A RAY OF HOPE WILL LEAD YOU HOME
[CHORUS]
SO WILL YOU STAND BESIDE
AMONG THOSE EVIL-EYED
VOICES WILL WHISPER INTO YOUR EAR
SO BELIEVE YOU'RE IMMUNE
SO WILL YOU BEG AND PRAY
TO LEAVE THIS ENDLESS GRAY
ONCE OF HIS AGE HE WAS BOAST
THE CANTERVILLE GHOST
BATHING IN TEARS AND SWIM IN DELIGHT
YEARNING FOR FEELINGS LONG GONE
ONE SORRY SIGHT, ONE FLY BY NIGHT
AS THIS GIRL IN HER PRIME CAME ON
BUT LOVE WILL BE STRONGER, THAN LIFE AND DEATH
WHEN CUPID'S DART HAS HIDDEN YOU
AS IF BY MAGIC THE ALMOND WILL BLOOM
THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING NEW
[PRE-CHORUS]
[CHORUS]
TEARS FOR MY SINS
I HAVE NO MORE
NOW PRAY FOR ME
I KNOW WHAT FOR
ANGEL WILL YOU
HAVE MERCY NOW
AND THE HOUSE SHALL BE STILL
[CHORUS]

Witch hunt is over
Six lives are over
Look to the father for the truth
The killer smiles without a tooth
Mothers weep as angels die
Witches burn for Salem's lies
These poor children gave their lives
Castrations upon the knife
Frozen still upon the ground
A life once lost without a sound
The truth will never set you free
A muting of the callow
Execute this paradise
Upon thy graves so shallow
Witch hunt is over
What we face is the price to pay
It is all debased and defiled
By the ignorant we nominate
To eradicate evidence of DNA
That would set the doves free once and for all
[Solo: Tony]

I know that absence might
Make the heart grow fonder
Or is it 'out of sight'
Out of mind' I wonder
And do you yearn for me
When the nights grow cold
'til death us do part
To have and to hold
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love!
But is it just me or am I all on my own again?
You're up at John O Groats, I'm down in Land's End
On you I depend!
I see your face when I close my eyes,
And there ain't no place
Like between your thighs
Don't want a life alone
All by myself
To honor and trust
In sickness and health
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love!
But is it just me or am I all on my own again?
You're in the Taj Mahal, I'm outside Big Ben
It's driving me round the bend!
Forever and ever
And ever, amen
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love,
Is it just me or am I all on my own again?
Is it just me or am I all on my own again?
You're in the Vatican, I'm in the Yemen
And it feels like the end,
The end!

Fused duodenum to esophagus
Inert maze of digestive tract
Visceral/abdominal U-turn
Diarrhea of the mouth
Broken capillaries and tissue
Combined with bile, hemorrhoids and feces
Microscopic amoeba, single-celled juggernaut
Regurgitation of shit and disease
You are what you eat
You are what you shit
You are what you vomit

Maggots feast, eternal whisper
Eating through your soul
In your head their bodies glisten
The stench of death is foul
Riot inside you
Swarming around and through
Crucified
A trail of insects down your spine
Vermin inside you
Control you
Devour you
Funeral
My sickening mind made you dissolve
Vermin inside you
They move you
Devour you
Poisonous, vile obedience
To rotting deadened art
Made me let this death-inferno
Rip my soul apart
Your skin is turning blue
I kill myself through you
I trap myself in blasphemous torture
Mind decaying fast
In hyper-death a carnal fortune
And deadly shadows cast
All the rotting flesh
Turned into a mesh
Their mastication
Violent invasion of my mind
Emptiness takes over
Pleasure's gone, insanity I find
Memories choke me
Chloroform drenched anxiety
Corpses provoke me
No more killing variety
Pestering forgery
I'm gone beyond all help
Dehydrated mind
I'm swallowing insects myself

Here they come, the winged minions of the dark lord
As black clouds, they block the light of the sun
By their side, flies the king of the demon locusts
The destroyer lord, and chosen son of the apocalypse
This for sure, is the end - of human race
Thunder roars, the abyss now, gaping wide
Darkness unleash, it's armies upon the world
The air filled with the stench of sulphur...
And burning flesh...
When the humans thought, they had seen the worst of hell
The ground explodes and fills the sky of dirt, and shattered bone
The necro-lord, rises from below
Gathered stands, the rest of his merciless horde
The merciless horde
The very few that might be alive, will be taken by the flames
The world is on fire, the flames climb higher...
The humans - erased
Now on the site, of where this slaughter took place
One building rise, built by the infernal race
A monument of evil, entirely made out of bones
It's all that remains - of the human race
The world is on fire - the flames climb higher...
"A time lost to the pestilent horrors of a new demonic age"
"Impaled atop the monument the tortured will burn"
"Forever..."
The very few that might be alive, will be taken by the flames
The world is on fire - the flames climb higher...
The humans erased...

Remind me of what you said life had made you do
What did you do to make all you had fall trough
What forces you to make the choices that you do?
Are we to blame for all the failures that are you
Or should we blame you?
Should we blame you?
I should blame you for the falling rain
I should blame you for my constant pain
I should be there to remind you every day, I should
How come we bear the cross that you should?
How come we wear the wounds that you should?
I am confused, why is it me who is bleeding?
We never had a chance to make a choice you had
We were all too young to understand
Not like you, not like you had?
I should blame you for the falling rain
I should blame you for my constant pain
I should be there to remind you every day, I should
I should walk you trough the halls of my own fate
I should let you taste the tears that fell in hate
I should be there to remind you every day, I should
Remind me of what you said life had made you do
What did you do to make all you had fall trough
What forces you to make the choices that you do?
Are we to blame for all the failures that are you?
Or should we blame you?
I should blame you for the falling rain
I should blame you for my constant pain
I should be there remind you every day, I should
I should walk you trough the halls of my own fate
I should let you taste the tears that fell in hate
I should be there to remind you every day
I should I should
I should let you taste that fell in hate.
I should be there to remind you every day.
I should I should

Please take my hand, and let me lead you through these museum halls.
My god, the light casts an ugly shadow across these decaying walls.
And should I ask you, is that fear I see etched across your sullen eyes?
Because inside this house, behind these cold stone walls,
you can hide amongst the candlelight but you cannot hide your voice.

Body
Body
Touched by the toil and plunged into his arm
Cursed through the night through eyes of alarm
A melody black flowed out of my breath
Searching for death, but bodies need rest
Body
Under the soil now waiting for worms
All that I feared is all that I've learned
All that I know is all that I think
Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink, ah-hah
Bodies need rest, we all need our rest
Sleep an easy sleep -rest -rest
Bodies need their rest
We all need our rest
Sleep an easy sleep-rest -rest -rest -rest
But come back in the morning
Come back hard
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Bodies
Clutching and biting my soul has caught on fire
My evil is now and I'm caught up in desire
Everything I'm living for is all that I am
Liking it and loving it that's all in the plan

Sedated and lazy cold skies full of blue
The sun burns forever it reminds me of you
On your dead shore the sand is warm
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die
I will make it thru even without you
My sky will be blue
I live tranquilized
Slow motion, liquid universe I'm feeling nowhere
It don't matter where we're goin' cause I already been
There on your dead shore the sand is warm
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die
Their dying of rabies eating their babies
In fields of dead daisies
I live tranquilized
I'm numb and unfeeling so I just burn and stare at the ceiling
I'm here but so far away I see your mouth movin' but can't hear what you
say
And I don't think I'd give a fuck anyway

I've had one desire since I was born
To see my body ripped and torn
To see my flesh devoured before my eyes
I'm here for you I volunteer as a human sacrifice
[Chorus]
Carve me up, slice me apart
Suck my guts, lick my heart
Chop me up I like to be hurt
Drink my marrow and blood for dessert
Eaten, my one desire, my only wish is to be
Eaten, the longer I live the more I'm dying to feel the pain
Eaten, I would do anything to be
Eaten, my one desire, my only wish is to be
Eaten,
I finally found you, my personal slaughter
As an appetizer, I let you taste my daughter
Call me sick but this is what I need
My only purpose here is for you to feed
Desecrate me
Tear me limb from limb
Eviscerate me
Chew me to death

I've heard a lot about you
And I've heard all about your disease
Well they say you're an animal
With a rabid desire to please
I'm on the hunt, you're on the prowl
Do you want to do the time
Come on, we've got nothing to lose
Let's commit the crime
I want your flesh
Sexecution
So the feeling is mutual
The huner's gonna turn into a feast
Got to cool the fire, control desire
It's time to unleash the beast
I want to sex you up, sex you down
I want to do it all over and all around
Russian roulette at a hundred degrees
I don't want to die but you sure can please
I want your flesh
Sexecution

Fetus on the beat
Red as it can be
Rhythmically miscarried
Flushed out into the sea
Funded resurrections
From the local town collections
Sugary sweet secreting glands
Flood the milk and honey land
Umblical nooses hang our nest
On every note and every rest
Fetus on the beat
High on lsd
Enter world war three
While in infancy
Funded resurrections
From the local town collections
Sugary sweet secreting glands
Flood the milk and honey land
Umblical nooses hang our nest
On every note and every rest
Conductor of the flies
Piss drunk and in disguise
You keep us all in time
To orchestrate a lie
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
Abort the beat
Abort the beat
Abort the beat
Abort the beat
Sadists and masochists
Who penetrate the melody
Into a spiral frenzy
They will rape you in a minor key
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
Unborn vertebrate
Withers and decays
A cappella fear
Is music to my ears
Funded resurrections
From the local town collections
Sugary sweet secreting glands
Flood the milk and honey land
Umblical nooses hang our nest
On every note and every rest
Conductor of the flies
Piss drunk and in disguise

Deira dagar har m?rkna
Moder jord meld sitt fraafall
Men sverdet har gaat vidare
Til ein ny b?rar
Me er einsomme menn
Me b?r fenresulvens muspell
Skoll skal sluka sola
Me er djerve menn
Sola svartner
Der fjellvegg ramlar
Naa gjestar sorgen
Paa livets tre (Yggdrasil)
For byleits bror farar
Kva er det ikkje Kampfar klaren?
[English translation:]
[Red And Black]
The days have darkened
Mother earth announces her death
While the sword has moved on
To a new bearer
We are lonesome men
We bear the wolf-Fenris Muspell
Skoll shall swallow the sun
We are brave men
Sun blackens
Where mountain's walls collapse
Now guest the sorrow
On the life's tree (Yggdrasill)
For Byleit's brother travels
What is it that the Warfather can't do?

I sit by the fires gleam all by myself
Four empty chairs & one've been kept warm
I drink to my kinsmen who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin who'll drink here no more
Odin owns ye all
I sing to them songs I wish their best on their way
I'm sure a valkyrie found them in the battle that day
I drink to my kinsmen who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin who'll be missed not just by me
Odin owns ye all
To arms To arms - The kinsmen said
They've chosen to meet us in battle today
Fight Fight - The kinsmen said
If we show true norse courage they'll soon run away
Wrong Wrong - The kinsmen thought
You cowards are fourty men may you rot in Hel
Rise Rise - The valkyries said
Odin decided this day you would die
I drink to my kinsmen
Who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin
Who'll drink here no more
Who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kinsmen
I drink to my kin
Who'll be missed not just by me
Odin owns ye all

blizzards reign the fires by
the pod - their cold heat set ablaze my
burning soul - embodiment at least
a fear rises - the storm clams the choires
forever - maybe even death
the birds move forward and try to escape
always following life
my fire - an ice desert - I burn
laughter experiences death
the death experiences life

(Words: Ihsahn/ Music: Samoth & Ihsahn
[opening theme originally composed by Euronymous]/
Arrangements: Samoth & Ihsahn)
Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond
Emperium
Behold my coming
The fullmoon rise above me
Enlightening my realm in a silvery glow
Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky
Guarding treasures from forbidden light
I still remember, though ages ago it seems
The first time I entered the gates
The revelation of ritual death
By which I became devine
Sacrifice of the life I had among the flesh of light
And now I enter again
Even stronger, yet amazed by what I see
In ecstsy I mock the world
Suddenly I memorize
Asking what I left behind
Nothing
Can I ever comprehend?
Will my longing ever end?
Never
Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Eternally

Prior to the forces of primacy
Concealed by the essence, the profane
Withdraws in manners of erosion
Spine of the universal conflicts
Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowed by dimensions
Swallowed by the flames
I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burn by sight
I see fear so clear when you die
The cries that torches swept by
I am yet to see the good victorious
Thunder tamed by silence
I am yet to see the man victorious
Death tamed by life
Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowing dimensions
Swallowing the flames
I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burns by sight
I see fear so clear when you die
Spine of the universal comfilcts
As the motion of winds and oceans
I am on the isle of existence,
the mountains at my trail
I am prepared to die,
when the faith comes around to fail
Swept towards a new domain
Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowing dimensions
Swallowing the flames
I see fear so clear in the eyes
The eyes that burns by sight
I see fear so clear when you die

Our souls are not ready for life
We're gonna have a fight
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies
Coming out to the streets
They'll complete what we did
Or what we wished to destroy.
They'll mess up despite the next
Outside our souls react to raging crowds. Tonight
They'll kill and demonstrate what fight is all about.
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing,
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you"
Blood and ruins, blood and ruins
Our fragile conscience lies awaiting for a war
Where liars and honest people fight to get some money.
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing,
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you"
Blood and ruins, blood and ruins
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing
What you do has no meaning,
Consider the fight's all around".

[Music: Magnusson, Holmild, Morek Lyrics: Heidgert]
The time of wonders has come
The Dragons soaring high
To Dragonland this story takes you
Come, follow me to that world
The you will finally see
Who'll win, who'll lose this final battle
They live without light
They love without guidance
A hero to lead them they need
They fight without hope
They fight without glory
A lightbearing savior they need
A hero will come with the dawn
To give them the light and the spirit to fight
A hero to banish the darkness
And to bring balance to life
At last he meets his brothers
Down on the mountainslope
Majestic Mightsil mountains guide us
The time has come to strike back
To face the enemy
Once more upon the Ivory Plains
But now they have light
They know they have guidance
A hero to lead them has come
They now have the hope
To fight for their freedom
The son of the Dragons has come
A hero has come with the dawn
He's given them light
And the spirit to fight
They're fighting to banish the darkness
And bring back the balance to life
[Solo]
A story will unfold before you
A world full of magic and glory
A tale lasting through generations
Will finally end, end with this war...

I'm gonna fight, in the Metal night
My guardian angel is my sword
I hear the call, I see the light
I'm gonna give my life for my lord
The quest is long and the end is near
I sail away in seas of doom
My shield is strong and I got no fear
I'm gonna face the enemy soon
The night is cold and the air is clear
The enemy could be anywhere (beware)
The serpent's eyes enlarge with fear
It's all about for those who dare
Thunder! Lighting! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!
Face to face with an army from hell
A sudden flash the battle is on
So swing the axe and cast the spell
Kill or be killed - dead and gone
The taste of Metal is the taste of blood
The enemies have got their reward
We buried them in seas of mud
They've felt the rage of my sword
The night is cold and the air is clear
The enemy could be anywhere (beware)
The serpent's eyes enlarge with fear
It's all about for those who dare
Thunder! Lighting! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!
Die, die, die, killing in the dead of night!!!
Thunder! Lighting! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!

Oh
There goes my Valentine again
I'm soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone
Oh my God have I done it again
There's a pulse that is deafening
I can't help what I hear in my head,
Its the switch that I flip (when you said)
Hand of blood
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
I don't want to see, my life is burning
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing
(I saw you run)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing.
There's a stain on my hand and it's red
Oh my god am I losing it
I can't help what I've done or I've said
?It's a button I push? (when you say)
Hand of blood
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
I don't want to see, my life is burning.
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing
(I saw you run)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing
(I saw you run)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing

Lost my faith in justice
Time does not heal this pain
Defiled my existence
Recurring nightmare
There's no consolation
The awful memories
Constant mind coercion
Instinctive vengeance
I have nothing left to lose now
Only time, regret and anger
Pain to last a hundred lifetimes
Hatred burning, love extinct
Compound insult of bullshit humanism
Misplaced rights, inflame my rage
Vacant cause, offender the victim
Fuck that worthless piece of shit
As long as you live on this earth
Rage unsatisfied
Memories dishonored
Retribution!!!
Giving hardened criminals
Preferential treatment
Settlement, live in prison
Better than you deserve
Jury of your peers, unable to do the job
Obliged by procedure, evidence examination
Now I'm coming for you, there will be no mistrial
Citizen retaliation, the mode of your demise
Moral speculation, some other poor bastard's life
The system has fucked up, left this hollow void
There will be no comfort, this sickness is terminal
Semblance of justice, infuriating lies
Lies acquitted, guilt unanswered, you will not escape
Cold, my revenge and my blood
Hate, nothing can stop it now
Death, the only end I accept
Hell, punishment I require
Curse, execrate, I must kill
Pain, I inflict merciless
Scream, piercing cries, agony
You should have plead guilty or killed yourself
Unshakable conviction, is all I have to live for
Excruciating terror, the violations you delight in
Useless human excrement, you deserve a life of shit
Make you suffer ruthlessness, I cannot relinquish the honor
Soul I condemn, fucking dead
Nothing will ever be made right again
The path of damnation I hasten you on my way
Every day you lived from then is one more day you owe me
If killing you destroys myself, I wouldn't have it any other way
Fine line between honor and horror, my every action justified
Innocence destroyed, needs anguish to cleanse impurity
Temporary insanity, obeys a singular purpose
Your death row is here and now, the only righteous ending
Die and die again, as I cut and mutilate
You are fucking worthless, I don't give a fuck about you
Blood your insides spayed, placates my hostility
End my days a killer, stripped of everything that mattered

Voice reminds of where we are, in a cement city...arrive
We gave it hell and we find ourselves coherent and so unclear
And I'm lost at sea with guides to spare, lost at sea with guides to spare
This is the sound waves of desperation
Ones of reminder and things that just won't heal and in time we will step away from this
Cause it's the hardest and longest, and in time we will make this disappear
Let this dig in 'cause I can see the shore
I think I can make it
Crash through the door
And I'm lost at sea with guides to spare, lost at sea with guides to spare
This is the sound waves of desperation
Ones of reminder and things that just won't heal and in time we will step away from all of this
'Cause it's the hardest and the longest
And In time we will make this all just disappear
We'll make this disappear, fight on (2)
We will, make this disappear (2)
Ones of reminder and things that just won't heal and in time we will step away from all of this...
Ones of reminder and things that just won't heal and in time we will step away from all of this
Cause it's the hardest and the longest
And In time we will make this disappear
We'll make this disappear, fight on
With the weight of the world, I was born for this...

A corpse is a corpse.
Of course it is.
Predetermined destiny,
Uncommon bond.
Don't be afraid to take my hand.
Walk with the dead beaten broken man.
A cult of me, a stain and feast the open brain.
The pleasures I indulge will pave a pathway to hell,
From an offset imbalance of membrane and cell.
And though you try and try and try to pull me down,
It's all been lies it's lies begat the lies again.
I not afraid, afraid of dying anymore.
Only I can set me free.
So turn and blame but don't you fuckin look at me.
It's over, it's over.
We've secretly replaced your pathetic existence with more pain
And anguish and suffering than one soul could possibly stomach.
So fasten your noose and enjoy your ride,
os life is hell and then you die.
And though you try and try and try to pull me down,
It's all been lies it's lies begat the lies again.
I not afraid, afraid of dying anymore.
Only I can set me free.
So turn and blame but don't you fuckin look at me.
Decompose you maggot.
Now youl shut the fuck up

New-age appearance, He didn't like
Her cheap skin, Like you and me...
And you abuse, But you can't see
And you abuse, Cause you can't touch
I hold your touch

A moment whispered
A fleeting thought
A lifetime lived
In one short breath
I sit alone in a quiet place
Remembering a smile
A smile that in one instant
Drowns out the sorrows of the world
A smile from the face of innocence
I sit and watch
As the seasons change
Falling like dying leaves
I sit and watch as the cold hands
Choke at my existence
You're not the only one
You're hurting
You stare expressionless
As our worlds are torn apart
I reach for your hand
Why don't you reach back?
God knows my heart
He knows my desire
She knows my inside
And how I tear at the pain
Of watching you die
When I pray I'm wishing
You were with Him

Elementary eavesdropper
They're things you cannot comprehend
Did you want a kiss
Did you want a flower in your fist?
Or was it all just make pretend?
I'll follow you until the end
I'll follow
Burning down your home, burning down
Just to rebuild it again, burning down
And I would never steal from you, burning down
Or anyone of your friends, burning down
Adolescent eavesdropper
They're things you wish you could forget
So you start to weep
And you start to drink yourself to sleep
And you only kiss your cigarette
But don't we all feel sick to death
Or do we?
Burning down your home, burning down
Just to rebuild it again, burning down
And I would never steal from you, burning down
Or anyone of your friends, burning down
You shower me with gifts
They don't fix it, no
I'm no purchase bastard
Fuck you, tell me right now
If you find me on the offensive
For the first time, help out
Tell me right now
Are you happy and how can you be?
Are you happy with me?
You're an adult eavesdropper
By now the roles have been replaced
And you inflict the shit you hated as a kid
There's only one way to break this curse
Burning down your home, burning down
Just to rebuild build it again, burning down
And I would never steal from you, burning down
Or anyone of your friends, burning down

So many hundreds of years ago a king was killed in a battle
Even his son was wounded to death, the only heir to the throne
The queen to save the life of the prince brought him to the dragon's lair
The dragon gave him a half of his heart, so he returned to life
[chorus]
Knight and the dragon together will fight against the king of the evil
He has corrupted the old dragon's heart, and he will pay with his blood
Knight and the dragon together will fight, tryin' to put down the tyrant
They are the last hope for this land to live
To live in freedom again
But growing up the new king betrayed what he did swear to the dragon
Evil and liar he became a tyrant, killing and raping for joy
The knight who was his master of sword, one day did meet the old dragon
And with a priest and a girl on their side, they did begin the rebellion
[chorus ]
[The Ancient Code:]
A knight is sworn to Valour, is heart only knows the Virtue
His sword defends the oppressed ones and serves the Truth
The final battle is now taking place, there's only one way to win
To save the day, to kill the king, even the dragon must die
Great is the pain in the heart of the knight, striking the deadly blow
Draco and the king together they die, but the last dragon still smiles
[chorus]

A creature made of sunshine
her eyes were like the sky
rabbit howls like something old
as we twitch to a lullaby
the scalpel shines in god's sunshine
the streetlights whisper pain
down here near the poison stream
our god has gone insane
she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
with blood on her hands
into the sun she stares
she feels it die
I heard her cry
she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
with blood on her hands
into the sun she stares
she feels it die
I heard her cry...
like the scream of the butterfly
sunshine in the house of flames
she loves it where she gets it
but it's never felt the same
surgery, in the house of dissection
when your candle burns out..I Will resurrect you
she runs
through fields of daisies
yeah, it's just a shame that they eat their own babies
who cares cause the air is free
when you get there will you kiss the dead for me?
There's blood on the moon and the summer is cold
There's blood in the room but that's gettin' old
There's blood on my face sittin' on a dead shore
A highway of emptiness and I'm gettin' bored
there's blood on the moon as we plan our escape
the goddess in bloom
handcuffed and raped
there's blood in the bathtub baby
murdered the king
there's blood on the moon
there's blood on just about everything
sunshine in the house of flames
she loves it where she gets it
but it's never felt the same
surgery, in the house of dissection
when your candle burns out..I will resurrect you
she runs
through fields of daisies
yeah, it's just a shame that they eat their own babies
who cares cos the air is free
when you get there will you kiss the dead for me?
Something cold is forced inside her a tear spills down her cheek
Stillborn songs of a dead dreamer, hymns of the needle freak
With sunlight in her hair she smiles like she don't care her dreams are
liquid blue
I cut myself again and again to remind myself of you
she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
with blood on her hands
into the sun she stares
she feels it die
I heard her cry
she smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
with blood on her hands
into the sun she stares
she feels it die
I heard her cry
like the scream of the butterfly
like the scream of the butterfly Yea Yea Yeaaaaaa!!!
like the scream of the butterfly
like the scream of the butterfly Yeaaaaaa!!!
like the scream of the butterfly
like the scream of the butterfly Yeaaaaaa!!!

You just stood there screaming
fearing no one was listening to you
they say the empty can rattles the most
the sound of your voice must soothe you
hearing only what you want to hear
and knowing only what you've heard
you you're smothered in tragedy
you're out to save the world
misery
you insist that the weight of the world
should be on your shoulders
misery
there's much more to life than what you see
my friend of misery
you still stood there screaming
no one caring about these words you tell
my friend before your voice is gone
one man's fun is another's hell
these times are sent to try men's souls
but something's wrong with all you see
you you'll take it on all yourself
remember, misery loves company
misery
you insist that the weight of the world
should be on your shoulders
misery
there's much more to life than what you see
my friend of misery

Concrete turns moisture
Deflated tankers
Liquid steelyards
All angles collapse
And it fits into a circle that starts to revolve
From Hoover Dam to Dnyeproges all structures dissolve
ON THE CANVAS OF HISTORY
GREASY HANDS ON THE CANVAS OF HISTORY
WHEN WE HAVEN'T NOTHING UP AHEAD
BY THE GLIMMERING OF MYTHS
THE LOSERS ARE LEAD
Swirling railroads
Slackening aircrafts
And all missiles are launched
To celebrate the old days
And it fits into a box that locks without a key
That shrinks and implodes and ceases to be
ON THE CANVAS OF HISTORY...etc.
ON THE CANVAS OF FUTURE
BUY AN AD ON THE CANVAS OF FUTURE
PANIC-STRICKEN BY
THE SEARCH-LIGHTS OF FUTURE
THEY WILL CROUCH IN FEAR
AND THEN BE LEAD AWAY
Thanking you for being put to sleep
And that's why future's fascism will be friendly

The wait is soon at end
Always charge, never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire
Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire
See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire
Forces of chaos are on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the day is coming soon
The day for all to die
The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
And Surtur spreads his fire
All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free
Total war is here, face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire

Black gate of the mortal
Sabbath held in thy honor, summon the anti-god
Is there nothing sacred? Is there nothing pure?
Cool winds are abound me from this fire well breath
Embracing the myth, everything I am to believe
Embracing the evil, everything that surrounds who I am
Smoke will rise from the graves of our elders once slain
Crack the whip, night draws near, darkness swallows me whole
Worship upon the dead, praise all Harassathoth
Satan summon ka-put ancients forces arise
Beelzebub suck my balls, Beelzebub will suck my balls
Corpses' rise from your tomb, paint thy light unto dark
Is there nothing sacred? Sexual urge for the dead
War, holy war, infernal names invoke the storm
The end of man has come to pass, goatwhore shall reign supreme
Lust for the dead in the cold night, a chill grasps my breath
I hold onto nothing, for this I shall fall, smoke a bowl
Read thy necronomicon, balls of fire, erupt from the pyre
Of unholiness in my mind, abaudahdine is honored
To behold black metal sabbath
Shootin' up to get my rush
This time I think I'll take too much
Barely breathing, profusely bleeding
I'd get my gun, if I could move
and put myself in the ground
Take a pill get all low, high again you jones
Twisting convulsing, overdosing, skin turns pale
Writhing in sweat, moribund death comes for you
Slicing your wrist as you die you now want to live

[Music & Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
You gotta know
That there ain't always
Words of reason to explain
With those words my heart is falling silent
To let me slowly go insane
God tell me why your voice ran dry
And left me dreaming black
[Chorus:]
Dying angels, Dying angels
Feeling takes a gun to fire
Reason from a lightening sky
Dying angels, dying angels
I'm agonizing over dreams
Strangled by a feeling
I wake up dreaming black
A million single islands drift apart
And I'm losing ground
The more I feel the less I know
Strait-jacket-hero inward bound
God tell me why your voice ran dry
And left me dreaming black
[Chorus 2x]
I wake up dreaming
Another hero - a dying hero
Another hero - a dying hero

The world has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stiff of age it cracks
Mirror reflects just what I lack
I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of what was
Plummet to sunken depths
There will be nothing left
Secrets of my being are being from me kept
There will be no resolve
For this wreck of nerves
Cheers to the axe that falls to the end
that I deserve
I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of what was
A shadow of what was
You are dead to me
I am dead to me
My pulse has stopped you see
The butcher's waiting meat
And for eternity
As Satan laughs
we'll burn together
and scream abysmally
The work has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stiff of age it cracks
Reflects just what I lack
I am alone
I live alone
I'll die alone
Beneath a nameless stone
I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anything but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of was
I'll try this noose on just because
Signed your friend, abysmally

(Verse 1)
Descend, alone in this world, been forgotten
(forgotten x 2)
If only we had been more certain..
Now I have given everything this last time
(the last time x 2)
And taking nothing back in return...
(Pre-chorus)
You don't make me....What I am....
(Chorus)
In my eyes, you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, reminded
Purest enemy, too far gone
In my eyes, you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, I'm hoping
You'll never be too far gone
(Verse 2)
Defend all the words spoken, say nothing..
(say nothing x 2)
The time has come and gone for changing..
We spend our final moments here together
(together x 2)
Without a scream, without a whisper
(Pre-chorus)
You don't make me....What I am....
(Chorus)
In my eyes, you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, reminded
Purest enemy, too far gone
In my eyes, you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, I'm hoping
You'll never be too far gone
Too far gone...
Too far gone...
If you could come in all misguided
What is left to say?
When everything you know is taken
Can you all go away?
(Chorus x 2)

Rising from the darkside
Arriving from beyond
The lord of death approaches
To end all human lives
The pleasure of the torment
Will bring him back to Earth
The time has come for closure
The final hour calls
But there's a way out of the misery
You can join the massacre
Once you're in you're never out
A soldier of the dead forevermore
[CHORUS]
There's eternity for sale
In the Brave New Hell
You will join here and dwell
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
None can stop the rising
Of the Brave New Hell
You will come alive
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
Your death for life eternal
Is no high price to play
You'll get more strength
From every single human that you slay
The night of devastation
The final holocaust
Bring on the armageddon
Only death remains
Now... that all his enemies have ceased
It's time for the final feast
Tear the flesh of the remains of mankind
The rebirth of Hell on Earth
Behold... eternal eclipse!
Humanity fades away
The creatures bond to black
Will turn color into grey

From the valleys to the coastlines
From the riverheads to sea
To the fields of four-leaf clover
Like a haggard falcon free
[chorus]
By a dovelike dream
Riding on wings of ever
From the top supreme
Where no one has gone before
On the glaring stream
Into the haven of time
To the land of peace
Where silence has lease
on the high-flown cliffs ascending
In the priming of the day
Feel the ocean's salient power
From the vantage point survey
[chorus]
By a dovelike dream
Riding on wings of ever
From the top supreme
Where no one has gone before
On the glaring stream
Into the haven of time
To the land of peace
Where silence has lease

Strangers beware but come if you dare
You've entered their sacred domain
Keep to yourself or with them you'll be dealt
The thrashers will put you to shame
Fight for your life but you have not a chance
Violence runs in their blood
Tear you apart as they rip out your heart
You've come to the wrong neighborhood
Kill as one
Come take a chance in the unholy dance
Where blood on your face is a treat
Dive off the stage your mind filled with rage
You're lucky to land on your feet
Jocks come along and they think they're so strong
Looking to start up a fight
They don't play fair jocks outnumbered and scared
Death will occur on this night
Kill as one

Nothing was supposed to hurt like this.
Missing you was always one more kiss.
Now there's nothing that I can do.
One more nail in the coffin, and it's all for you.
Always were and always were a simple love story.
You were everything I ever hoped and dreamed.
Drown me in a pool of my blood.
It's getting harder just to breathe.
I'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleep.
It's getting harder just to say the right things.
I've seen the angel's face, and I've heard her sing to me.
From my reflection on this razor
Blade, I've heard ten thousand dying screams,
And they're calling me. the day
Will break on this saddest day, so don't let me wake.
I've heard this all before, and I've seen this over and over again.
Don't let me wake.
Drown me in a pool of my blood.
It's getting harder just to breathe.
I'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleep.
So you can't see me sleep.
The day will break on this saddest day, so don't let me wake.
I've heard this all before, and I've seen this over and over again.
Don't let me wake.
Nothing was supposed to hurt like this.
And missing you, was always one more kiss.
And now there's nothing that I can do.
There's just one more nail in the coffin.
There's just one more nail, and it's all for you.
I've seen the angel's face, and I've heard her sing to me.
From my reflection on this razor blade,
I've heard ten thousand dying screams,
And they're calling me.
The day will break on this saddest day, so don't let me wake.
I've heard this all before, and I've seen this over and over again.
Don't let me wake

Chorus [fiend]: x 2
Whoa there, big timer, big timer
I got money to the ceiling
Whoa there, big timer
Won't 'cha, make your money and do what ya wanna
[mia x]
Let the champagne glasses, cashes, comin out the ass
Drinks for everybody, biggest mama stickin up the tab (mama mia)
Don't even ask if I could handle it
Bitch you didn't know I'm stackin ends like the clampets (there it is)
Down south hustlin, workin my musc-lin
Mint greens labeled in God we trust'n
Bustin at the haters in the way of progress
Cause I ain't tryin to live from month to month (naw) that's stress
I only want the best that there is off the top
But I ain't bout to brag about the shit I don't got
So when you see the e4-20 know that it's mine, paid out in full
So I put it in my rhyme
Thirty two hundred square foot, no doubt
Manicured landscape, and this my house
Paid out too, so I know I got the room
To state the fact that them hoes don't like that
But fuck that big timers put your knot in the air
And cock your nine for them jackers out there
Live your life, boy
Chorus x 2
[fiend]
I be crackin like chiropractors
Fiend the young bachelor
That's too many muthafuckin million dollars, what I'm after
Meal ticket stash-a from brick flippin plaster
Now forever paid with mama mia and the master
I cause disasters from the s's to the g
No clubs won't start without the presence of me
Ya better ask somebody, my cake give knee chills
Givin migraine headaches from breakin these bills
See these chills but can't get to it, we way out
Every (? ) that I drive on chrome, is paid out
Close to the house on the hill, but no wife
Take the diamonds out my rol, your house have no light
The more ice, I'm wicked you're sick, and just piss ya
Might take a long line, the dance floor on whispers

In his sign
You will see these golden letters
Make sure that no one enters
My mighty high house
During the years
Every desire slowly walked in
Decorated walls are talking
Of riches and fame
And now he can tell
When your heart is made out of gold
It's going to weigh like hell
Ever wonder if all was worthwhile?
Seen through the haze?
You never found
Pockets in the shroud
Hear the thunder and brimstone raining
The rats in the race
They never found
Pockets in the shroud
What is left
Not so much of children's stories
But a basement full of worries
Deep underground
Once long ago
All the crossing roads were still there
When your hair has long since turned silver
There is no return
Who would have believed
A fool had built a house out of
The years he left unlived
Sky is coming down
Lightshow and the bitter rain
Echoing sound of pairs of boots
They are walking up a hill
On the borderlines of sleep
On such a day
It is fine that it should rain

[Music: Thijs, Lyrics: Sven]
A quick grasp of insanity, cranial tissue in decay
A force fed tool of apathy i am
Parasitic life form, infesting my whole being
Necrotic fungus resecting organs to create...
From the realm of the dead I'm fed
Cracking open the coffin lid
Driven by a hunger, unable to grasp
A chemical reaction that campels me to grab
The axe, anxiously removed from its shelve
With an unpredescent joy I brutally hack
Psychonecrotic hallucinations,
as my skull begins to reek
With goreastic elegance I purge the weak
Parasitic life form
Rehashing the dead for its cause
The chopping of heads
A daily act of self-enjoyment
Cranial metamorphosis,
A forensic decrepit anomaly
Intestines turn into pulp
Axe wielding among the stiffs
Parasitic resection...

now with my voice I call your name
and with those hands I reach for you
this search is over I covet your taste
you are the gift I have longed for
beautiful dreamer
sleep eternal and dream of me
a face that follows a face that haunts
deprivation awaits
but still I ignore what exhumes
and destroys my trust
and I walk this precipice and I fear the fall
and the two intertwine
there is nothing but you and I
be still for I am now your god
fall into my arms and weep for me
your dying breath a song of love
remember me
this body means nothing
my only sin was the longing
every object so fleeting
you were chosen you were special
I pray for innocence
you were chosen you were special
and once again the hunger begins anew
and there is blood on my hands

Infertile wet soil's where it begins. Composition. Mud and skin. Blessed
scavengers foraging through the thing once fetal, but not dead. The
messengers are maggots, meat on their lips. Roots through throat, mouth and
eyes. Growth tears through the organic mass. Fauna is fucking flora in the
open wide. The oubliette, separation, abandonment. Those are true death.
Stalk against stake will be reaped. It bears the seed of those to be freed.
So suck and swallow it, wash it down with green fluid. That aftertast e is
life. So soft to the touch, in the afterbirth they fell in upon themselves.
When absence takes the young away, don't just stop. Use what's left to
rebuild from the ground up, and it will be. Inside those proteins. A renewed
life being released with bile's ease from the germinated seed. We reaped and
fed. Ingesting them and then loved and bred, remade them in out image. Then
dug holes that hid all our secrets.

"Paint me as a dead soul
The flesh, the image, the reflection
Let's complete the illusion"
There is a flame untamed
Deep in my heart
Unyielding, pure Ain Soph
'tis measureless
Our right divine:
Aspire to all horizons
To seek nature ov things
Retreat within yourself
To find the primal breath
Slaves ov the dead gods
Martyrs ov the falsehood
Your life is death now
Engulfed by the wake ov a million years
Welcome to Amenti
To perceive means to know
To possess means to deny
In the catacombs ov life
Concealed within deaths vaults
Pure vibration lies
Nitya-samsarins
Travel to the house ov empty words
Am-Heh! devour their hearts!
Slaves ov the dead gods
Martyrs ov the falsehood
Your life is death now
Engulfed by the wake ov a million years
Welcome to Amenti
Jerusalem is falling!
Falling! falling!
Jerusalem is falling!
Yerushalaim nehereset!

After you my dear,
in mutial use we're one, you see
You will know, how it feels to sing along,
with angelsongs, and ride the glory winds
Rule the tide
lose all thats you, all you can memorize
It's to bad, you're stuck in your stupidity
Use your head, it's just a game of give and take
Make your choice, it's joy versus reality
In a dream a woman cried from high above
Telling me In heaven they don't have enough
Can't you see, weOre messengers of higher breed
You and me,
We're all that's left of men's supremacy
[Chorus]
Eyes behold; one of these days all my dreams'll enfold
Lies scream; It's over...over...
In return; for 'all the faith' that you had in me
You all may dig your holes
So in love my dear
By my side, while I'm inside of you
Yes it seems IOm seeing others down the side
Don't blame me I'm far to sick to realize
Seventeen, virginity on hand and knees
Stick with me
The needle shows just what you mean to me
[Chorus]

(Exodus and Baloff)
Smell of death lurks around the place
Human need, unholy race
See the bloody pile of bones
The night is filled with hellish moans
It's been around for oh so long
At dawn of time they sang their song
The need to eat the human flesh
The strength it gives to pass the test
(chorus)
Feel the power
Of your unholy death
Feeding-frenzy
Human-flesh
To live
first lead fill- Gary
second lead fill- Rick
Ther is no law, it's time to fight
A brutal hunt every night
Life grows through hounds of flesh
A stronger soul from another death
Hidden back, yet deep within
Jungle's there, it's always been
Hunt at night to stalk their prey
Kill and eat it before it's day
(chorus)
Feel the power
Of your unholy death
Feeding-frenzy
Human-flesh
To live
solo- Gary
solo- Rick
Dead bodies lie where they fed
Half eaten carcass stained red
Hunting parties come to call
Leaving nothing, they take it all
There's no need to change their ways
Blood and money, it always pays
Don't disturb their solitude
Or the next victim will be you!
(repeat chorus)
solo- Rick

My mamma wants to know
Where I'm spending all my dough
Honey, all she does is nag, nag, nag
But I won't apologise
I'd inject into my eyes
If there was nowhere else to stick my skag
All I want is brown
And I'm going into town
Shooting up as soon as I'm back
My friends have got some good shit
All I want is some of it
Gimme, gimme, gimme that smack
Well I've ruined nearly all of my veins
Sticking that fucking shit into my arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Getting off my face
There's a dragon I must chase
Honey, I'm the scourge of all mankind
And everyone but me
Is destined just to be
Slaves to the remorseless grind
But I found myself an easy way out
Sticking that fucking shit into my arms
Into my arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck

you look at me like the dog you are
Your naked body all covered with scars
Out of the closet for an hour or two
For a urine bath and sadistic screw

Farewell
Yesterday when we were young
Like a flower in the desert sand
So transient the cycle of life
[Chorus]
Within a moment of time
Within a while of a years' decline
The brightest of stars above
In night-time skies divine
Here
It is an everflowing stream
When they are coming to redeem
Us from the night
That never sees the day
[Chorus]
And when the years passing by
No one will answer no one will cry
The solace in sea of tears
Into a new sunshine
Glory ascending
From days never ending
Unfold your dreams right now
[Chorus]

[DMC]
Force set up the hip-hop police
Can't find peace in the Middle East
Some punk rapper always gots to beef
What's goin on with all the priests
Church should be shamed about what they did
First PlayStation never touched the kids
This revelation is a prophecy
The only way out is you and me
We gotta sit and wait then go to sleep
The promise of the kids I gotta keep
Life is rough enough on the street
I gotta make sure that we all can eat
Chuck said rap is like CNN
We keep tunin out instead of tunin in
And while we're sleepin they're watchin us
And instead of watchin them we're not wakin up
[Josh Todd from Buckcherry]
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the Joker to the King
There's too much con-fu-sion
I can't get no relief
[DMC]
It's easy for D to be the all-time great
And now I be the one they'll assassinate
I'm talkin on the topic and I'm talkin truth
Cause I know knowledge can save the youth
Here's how the dollars need to be used
We got a choice to save the schools
Billionaires, millionaires and trillionaires
They say that the money is never there
Tell me the truth, tell me you don't care
You profit off the music and the clothes I wear
You gettin that money, yeah that's all good
You ain't doin a damn thing for the hood
You ain't doin anything you know you should
You ain't doin anything you know you could
It be the dollar dollar dollar and you gotta gotta lotta
But you don't know what hip-hop means to Bambaataa
[Josh Todd from Buckcherry]
No reason to get excited
The thief he got exposed
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
[long interlude and guitar solo]
[Josh Todd from Buckcherry]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Them and servants too, yeah alright
[DMC: repeat 6X]
This revelation is a prophecy
The only way out is you and me

I've just returned from a long round trip
Many tales I have to tell.
Now I don't get high,
so you think I'm not hip
But I've seen the gates of Hell.
How can a youth rise above all the shit
When surrounded
by such lousy influence?
He clutched his pipe, took his last hit,
And nobody's heard from him since.
Chorus
In this world of confusion
Drugs were my solution
The pain was breaking my heart.
I shut out my reality
Nearing my fatality,
found myself falling apart.
Miserable, horrible, life such an obstacle
Making my own matters worse.
To end up dead in a dark alleyway
Or to ride in the back of a hearse.
To die for a cause like pride or respect
Or honor would make you quite worthy;
A pitiful waste to live in the sewer
And die before you reach thirty.
Chorus (4x)
Cop a bag as a crutch
copping out, lose so much
Hangin' out, dippin' butts
Lost my mind smoking dust
There and back
Back in the days I was living a lie
Too cool to show my feelings,
too cool to cry
Lost in a fog and unsure of my friends
With a one way ticket
headed strait for the end
As the flames burnt the rope
and my spirit cut loose
I found my self wrapped
in an emotional noose
I said to myself continue no longer
Today I face the world with a mind
that is stronger
Spent my time gettin' nice
I crapped out rolling dice
Look at me and my scars
Now I live pure and hard
There and back (4x)

Pure speed in thermal overdrive
Performance always set to the hilt
Ignition, time to ignite
The ultimate machine ever built
High-octane adreanaline rush
Nothing's gonna get in my way
Time-bomb, hell-bent for destruction
There will be hell to pay
Speed and aggression, a deadly obsession
Joining together in ultra-motion
Born out of fire, they into one
We all come together in ultra-motion
Burn, electricity
Ripping through the air-ways
The direction's not an issue
It is the energy that I crave
Forces un-natural
Conquering the speed of light
Charging, invincible
I am the power and the might
Hell racer
I gotta go, I got the speed

Subconscious lie, who did they really kill?
Shattered hope, a slave to his master
He starts thirsting for the things he may never near
The falling tears, falling from your sorrow
You wonder why they'll rip you all to shreds
Bomb the poor, if that's what living means to thee
They realize that religion wants them dead
Imagine their emotion, for someone's need to kill
For some other religion but yours
It's just the death of your religion that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss
You
Blinded eyes, no more consolation
Subconscious lie won't set you free
Your falling tears, our own extinction
Abandon stories, now everything can be seen
You're living out this lie
And the rest of you are blind
Can't you fucking see?
Subverted with a lie
Imagine their emotion, for someone's need to kill
For some other religion but yours
It's just the death of your religion that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss

When I was young, it seemed that lilfe
was so wonderful,a miracle,
oh it was beautiful, magical.
And all the birds in the trees,
well they'd be singing so happily,
joyfully, playfully watching me.
But then they sent me away,
to teach me how to be sensible,
logical, responsible practical.
And they showed me a world
where I could be so dependable,
clinical, intellectual, cynical.
There are times when all the world's asleep,
the questions run too deep for such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am
Now watch what you say or
they'll be calling you a radical,
liberal, fanatical, criminal.
won't you sign up your name,
we'd like to feel you're acceptable,
respectable, presentable, vegetable!
At night, when all the world's asleep...
[Outro:]
Please tell me who I am who I am who I am who I am

Kevin:
Will we ever know where we came from
or find the first signs of creation?
(Will we ever know?)
These questions hound us
since the beginning of times
Nobody has ever been able
to give humanity an answer
and we're still waiting for one...
Life is a gift given to men by something we don't know
Don't let it drift away and pick the fruits of the seeds we sowed
Explore the Universe
breathe new dimensions
and find the answers
to those eternal questions
From the bottom of our hearts
to the tips of our tongues
we're all conscious
we are not alone
We must know who put the seeds of life on Earth.
and still...
These questions hound us
since the beginning of times
Nobody has ever been able
to give humanity an answer
and we're still waiting for one...
Life is a gift given to men by something we don't know
Don't let it drift away and pick the fruits of the seeds we sowed
Fella:
Will our creator ever show himself to us?
Time for humanity has come to open up our eyes
Earth has become our grave
but we won't die buried in our ignorance
Don't let evolution stop.
Kevin:
Will we ever know where we came from
or find the first signs of creation?
Don't let evolution stop and find salvation

As this eternal struggle has come to end
The light of life now shines upon us once again
But can we truly be free of tyranny and grief?
I see a thousand points of light reaching for me
Now nature grows and blooms and people live again
Yet this is not the end, I feel it
This power given to me is more than I can bear
Unbidden flowing through my mind
Divine it is but it could ruin this world
I see a thousand points of light reaching for me
Now nature grows and blooms and people live again
Yet this is not the end, I fear it
I am the one to end this game
This world will never be the same
I have the power in my hands
The time has come to save all life
I'll do what it takes, no more lies
I'll choose the destiny of Dragonland
A thousand points of light
The madness now have to end
I am yet to destroy the ones
The gods responsible for this
A thousand points of light
My final quest is at hand
To let people live their lives in peace
Without gods and without me
With great reluctance I reached into the light
I rise up to the skies enraged and full of might
They stand before me radiating azure-blue
I'll fight them till the end, yes, that's what I must do
And I shall rid this world of gods to rule our lives
So now the end is here, I know it
With all my force I strike them down
They scream in anguish as they drown
In fire they now turn to sand
They beg for mercy, I give none
My live is over, my quest done
I've saved all living here in Dragonland
A thousand points of light
The madness now, it has end
I've yet to become one with
All one with universe
A thousand points of light
Dragonland is at peace
A thousand points of light
Is reaching for me

All you have left is a wish to die and all you see is black
Your tortured soul cries out for a relief
You can't go on like this, you'll hit the wall, scared to death
I gave you life, I trashed your wall of self-defense
Now you have nothing, only the fear remains
The fear of dying, your long gone disease
Everything dies, rises and fades away again
Sacrifice, you paid your dues with your own blood
Everything dies, you took your life just like you knew I would
Crucified, nailed like christ, no sacrifice, everything dies
All you have left is a wish to die and all you see is black
Your tortured soul cries out for a relief
Now you are hanging in a rope, cold and naked,
A few seconds away from Hell,
Finally your life is gone, at last your spirit is home,
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing left, just black holes
Sacrifice, you paid your dues with your own blood
Everything dies, you took your life just like you knew I would
Crucified, nailed like christ, no sacrifice, everything dies

Shattered dreams of you & I
Awaken consumed by tortured lies,
Growing throughout eternity,
The love that died is eating at me
Choice made to prolong the death,
The empty feeling of your last caress
Nobody knows where the time has gone
Destined to stand all alone,
Thriving off the anguish of life
Broken hopes of yesterday forsaken to believe,
The fire burned beneath, her fear has become
Stronger behind her stubborn pride
State of confusion, reject the sickness!
Torn between love & hate, that is what I feel
Hoping to understand why my heart aches
For you as you crush my pride
My soul can't find rest,
A contrast in view has made it clear
Thoughts shared were untrue,
Cloned feelings of past failures
State of confusion, reject the sickness!

The time for execution, a harrowing display
For treachery upon the seas has taken place this day
Your final hour has begun,
We've all agreed your end has come
We'll take your sword, we'll take your gun it's time
For you to come undone
Be aware, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and pointy teeth
Walk the Plank!
With your life, you'll pay the price
Walk the Plank!
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the Plank!
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the Plank!
Descend into the black and don't come back
A nameless bay, in the mist
You have no right to exist
You've got the captain really pissed,
and so it's time you were dismissed
Give the line a little twist
And wrap the ropes around your wrist
Eyes to fill your soul with dread
The fury of the hammerhead
Walk the Plank!
With your life, you'll pay the price
Walk the Plank!
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the Plank!
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the Plank!
Descend into the black and don't come back
Be aware my friend, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and full of pointy teeth
Burning eyes to fill your soul right up with dread
The raging fury of the hammerhead

We can make it something but both know that there's nothing
It's like couple suicide, it's not going right
We ain't got no feelings, so why don't we stop dreaming
Shake it up a little bit to sleep a little better at night
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
And I know you know it, too
And we can make it something but both know that there's nothing
It's like couple suicide, it's not going right
We ain't got no feelings, so why don't we stop dreaming
Shake it up a little bit to sleep a little better at night
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back just to make it something
(Maybe you know what's right)
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
And I know that you know, too
You know, I know you do, baby
Now, what we gonna do about it?
What we gonna do?
When you said goodbye, you can't say I didn't try
To make it all better
Something had a hold on me and I couldn't see
But now I can and now I know I'm free
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
(Maybe you know what's right)
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
(Maybe you know what's right)
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
You know I know you do, baby
And the only way to end this thing
Is if we drive it six feet underground

Monuments of dying dreams
As far away as Eden
These hours standing still
Finding comfort in a distant past
Slaves of yesterday
You are blind
Blind to the sunrise
A roaming spirit, forever lost
Among the living
Walking down the fatal road
Cursed to be left behind
Slaves of yesterday
You are blind
Blind to the sunrise
Slaves of yesterday
Slaves of yesterday
Slaves of yesterday
You are blind
[Repeat: x2]
Blind to the sunrise

Fighters, igniters
A storm of intruders
Defenders are chosen
To fight off soldiers of venom
Intruders live - cast in stone
Intruders die - Forgotten souls
Atomic, barbaric
Break down the fears of terror
Evil dementors
Send a message of power
Intruders live - cast in stone
Intruders die - Forgotten souls
(SOLO)
Atrocities, injustice
Break down screaming killers
Danger awaits us
Beware of human sacrifice
Intruders live - cast in stone
Intruders die - Forgotten souls

So you think you are safe, and nothing can hurt you
it's all an illusion, created from lies
made yourself a safehouse, no one can get in
but you are the prisoner, in your imaginary world
You should take a look - at the concrete maze
cause you'll die alone
Yes your loosing grip, though you never had control
never going back, cause insanity takes hold
and now you're walking away...
And in the dark corners, your demons dwell
haunting your mind, infecting the cells
you're lost in your hallways, the walls are closing in
built your house for protection, and now you're crippled by fear

Flesh is all that you want,
it's all that you see in this
crushing game of yours
Life itself never satisfies
you in your twisted act in
this theatre of power
Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love
Can't you see what you're doing
to those who believe in you
and your psychotic eyes
Smile on your face, insanity!
They belong to your circle of misery.
Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love
All heil, heil the flesh!
You never care of anything else
All heil, heil the flesh!
You never care of anything else
Just sacrifice everyone
in the name of your god
but remember that your time will come
Sick addiction, and years tradition
Pride has been taken away from your soul
Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love
All heil, heil the flesh!
You never care of anything else

He was named Nineteenhundred 'TD'
In the ship's belly lies his cradle
Had no birthday and no land for home
The ocean has no bounds Virginian sounds
And he faced the world from inside
The ballroom of splendid skies
And on the grand piano
His hands light as butterflies
He played for the rich and for the poor
Thrilling the hearts of all
The world could have been beneath his feet
Searching the call, the voice of the sea
Old chandelier tells a story
Old piano still echoes in here
Old ship lies rusted in the port
And the best years fade away
The splendor has gone
Not what he saw could hold him back
It was what he didn't see
There was no end in this town, keys so eternally
But this was God's piano
He heard on the gangway there
He couldn't leave forever
The sea to somewhere
Bow and stern all the wishes between
(Wishes to yearn)
The world outside is a dream
(A lone dream, long time gone)
And when the whole world's leaving
The music will always stay
And if a story's worth to tell
The end will be far away
The final notes lie mute upon the sand
When land is a ship too big
A woman out of reach
A journey too far, a whiff too strong
He didn't exist for anyone
Bow and stern all the wishes between
(Wishes to yearn)
The world outside is a dream
(A lone dream, long time gone)
And when the whole world's leaving
The music will always stay
And if a story's worth to tell
The end will be far away
The final notes lie mute upon the sand
And in this lonesome end
Final notes lie mute upon sand

Why don't you lay down my darling?
You look as if you're at wits end
Sip this, I made it especially, my decomposing friend
Oh how your eyes respond fondly, as your larynx dissolves apart
Vapour emits from your delicate mouth as my loving potion burns out your heart
Kiss me now, you know where I love it,
it doesn't matter if you bite
For I extracted all your teeth to stop you putting up a fight
[Chorus]
Playing hard to get, I said, was useless from the start
Now as you lay, still as a slut,
with your long legs torn apart
Playing hard to get, I said, will lead to nothing but strife
But you changed your mind so quickly as you sat upon my knife
I love your sweet cold fingers,
they love to dangle and play
Don't fret, you didn't really need them,
so I devoured them as an entree
I hate what you've done with your hair!
Give it another trim, me thinks!
Take it off at the neck-line and put in a blood-red rinse
[repeat chorus]
'Cause playing hard to get my love was a useless game to play.
You knew you really wanted me,
oh your skin's so soft to flay
[repeat]

Many rocks the rapid has
A lot of billows the sea
More plentiful are my cares
Then cones on a spruce
Beard moss on a juniper
Gnarls upon a pine bark
Knobs upon a fir
Husks on a grass-top
Boughs on a bad tree.
Drag my cares away
Carry off my griefs
For no horse can draw
No iron-shod jerk
Without the shaft-bow shaking off
The cares of this skinny one
The sorrows of this black bird

Julie's on the run so far away from home
Mesmerized by promises and gold
Took the wrong left, turn,
It's just a one way street
Now she's all alone, out in the cold
Yes it's true we've heard it all before
But little Julie laughs no more
Julie's now on her way to grandma's house
A tiny little cottage in the woods
Hunting wolves are chasing
This delicious mouse
Where she went we never understood
Nothing really matters anymore
No Julie longer knocks on the door
A fallen princess bends her head in shame
In the end there's no one else to blame
And she's falling
Falling without reach
Julie's falling, lost in her dreams
Afraid to go, afraid to live
Into the emptiness what there's to believe
Julie's on the bean stalk way up in the clouds
Can't stop climbing, refuses to look down
The giant in his castle,
Laughs gives wondrous wows
She's cast into the stew without a sound

To not forget our loving, should I a sign implore?
I'd ask for you, but dearest, you are your own no more
Nor do I beg a flower from in your golden hair
Forgetfulness, beloved is but my single player
Oh what a sad sensation, when joy that soon did wane
Not swift with it to vanish, but ever here remain!
When through tits life to wander it has been writ, it seem
A dream made out of shadow, a shadow made of dream
No matter when I die, this or some later day
My wish is out of the mind of all to I pass away
And you forget the dream that our two hearts endears
When you loom back, beloved, upon the faded years
Let in the depths of shadow my memory be gone
As though we midst our loving each other had not known
A chant of lamentation within cold walls of chime
To beg for me in weeping the peace of endless time
As though those hours of wonder in fact we did not live
That I so deeply love you dear one can you forgive?
My face turned to the desert you left me all alone
And cold beneath my eyelids my eyes have turned to stone
And when at last death's soil my body does reclaim
Then who will know me or know from whence I came?
Let in the depths of shadow my memory be gone
As though we midst our loving each other had not known
A chant of lamentation within cold walls of chime
To beg for me in weeping the peace of endless time
While then... should they my body into the gutter throw
Still that would be far better than what I suffer now
Afar of in distance a flock of crows arise
And darken all the heavens before my sightless eyes
Beyond the earth's steep margin a hurricane does start
Flinging to the world my dust and to the wind my heart
Yet as in spring the blossom do you remain the while
With gentle eyes and humid and tender, childish smile
So much a child, yet seeming each day to younger grow
And of my fate know nothing as I too nothing know
My face turned to the desert you left me all alone
And cold beneath my eyelids my eyes have turned to stone
And when at last death's soil my body does reclaim
Then who will know me or know from whence I came?
While then... should they my body into the gutter throw
Still that would be far better than what I suffer now

Consume. Defecate. Consume again.
Hollow and empty. Consume.
And this is where we're at.
Running in reverse.
I'll tell you what you need to be through what you own.
Through what controls your mind, your life.
Define yourself in my holy image.
The things you own end up owning you.
A seance of aesthetic brotherhood.
Fortitude not for the good for your soul
From IKEA nesting, to sound investing,
to temp jobs that define what we are.
A dime a dozen, hope is dead.
Work towards nothing.
Groth means nothing if it defines human life by what you can buy.
Give up your life.
Or what is left of your life.
Give up you life. Let go. I'm losing it.
I'm pulling my hair out tring to figure out what couch defines me as a person?
This is madness. This is hopelss.
My perfect little habitat and I still don't know myself.
Hope is sold in your head.
Residing in your head.
Existing only in your head.
Working for the economy.
But is this working for you?
You're running stride is just to keep the pace.
AND I WATCH THIS BURN YOU ALIVE.
Burn you alive. Burn your life. Bury you life.
You are all my children now.
Consumption: identity.
Function: Consuming again.

confined i'm confined
straightjacket
strapped to my side
entangled
in motion i'm bound
in suspense
seclusion alternates
only between hope
and delusion
a victim of substance
and anchored prey
who will not live
to see the day
the devil lies below
i am deprived
light blinding
in my eye
he uncoils his claws
and clasps my nature
and to grasp my soul
he stretches his life out within:
in trade for freedom
in change for designs
his demons consume
the death sedative
i see them fly
through the sun
of my eye
then comes the way
he slides along
quietly listen
into the deep
mouth of the venom
planting his teeth in
the poison remedy
while demons swarm

Rip and cut and mutilate the innocent,
His friends, and again and again and on and on.
You make me own my life in Hell, my kingdom back to the bound
You say you don't make it alone, kingdom back to the Lord
Falling, I say, you too, falling, you too, born to die
Come with hate
Come and die
One day I'll face you all alone,
Enduring out with wind and ice
It's payback time, it's your demise sought to feel:
They'll taste of my scythe
You say my ear, my God who help me, God take yours in shame
Back too low, I want your head on a plate to feel my eyes
Come with me, I want your blood to save it on my eyes
I want you and in the plate to be coming in the sky (sky!)
Come with hate
Come and try
One day I'll face you all alone,
Enduring out with wind and ice
It's payback time, it's your demise until they feel:
Taste of my scythe
Hate Me!
I was born in ashes of molten hatred
Raised by demons in abodes of the end
The Reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life
I have become become the resurrection of the Evil one
Why know that I don't fucking care if I live or die
I need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins
I despise everything I see so I don't give a fuck if ya hate me
Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality
The Reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path
Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed
You motherfuckers just leave me be
Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside
Led by the Reaper I walk in the night
Show me the way to yer kingdom come
I believe in Armageddon, I've been baptized in alcohol
I'm embodiment of Antichrist
I'm living for my own demise

Reach inside of me
Far beneath the encasing of ashes
Bleeding red
Still showing signs of life
Remove the darkness
Take me away
A Stream of Hope destroy this corrupted cell
Purification
(Leaving me desolate in the face of perfection)
Unable to hide I am drawn to the fire
It is this pain that brings me likely do

Oh, human doll - you know I am the one
Now, broken doll? Now all ethic's gone
Because I'm the shelter and the knife ,The infernal tramp and the lies
And I'm inside you deep, The greatest tear when you weep
?The virus in your heart?
And this is how my name will shine and shine again
Above you child?
Alight and scarred I'll leave you alone in this place
Enter this world
I am the one
This is home
I am the Motherzone
Enter this world
I am the one
Return home
To the body of the Motherzone
Get in line, kids - you know I am the one
Oh, walk away with me? dead daughter and son
Well, I'm the source and the field, The shiny scythe that you wield
And I'll be the drug in your blood, The first wave of that flood
?The D in Darkness?
Come to me now, little child!
Motherzone, Motherzone, Motherzone
Come to me, you're the first in line!
Motherzone, Motherzone, Motherzone
Come to me?
Lick me dry!

With contamination comes fever
The disease is at its worst.
Teeth missing, beyond repair
Fragile flesh falling away.
With fever, with virus comes the harshest judgement.
Haunting elements create a horrific monster.
You've never seen such grey skin, freezing to the touch.
You've never seen such grey skin, freezing to the touch.
This is a call to arms, human race.
With contamination comes fever
The disease is at its worst.
Immune to water, immune to weather all to spread the curse.
Bones brittle ready to snap, mind unstable highly enraged.
Bones brittle ready to snap, mind unstable highly enraged.
Dirt underneath the nails of fingers tearing at your sanity.
Dirt underneath the nails of fingers tearing at your sanity.
There is no changing structure
There is no retracting anatomy.
This architecture, it cannot be destroyed.
There is no retraction.
No retraction
Close your eyes, but nothing changes.
We all know what brings this on.
Close your eyes, still nothing changes.
No one knows how to take it back.
Close your eyes, but nothing changes.
We all know what brings this on.
Close your eyes, still nothing changes.
No one knows how to take it back.

Valor they instill to face certain death in conflict
Win the war through discipline
Trained to follow orders
Dilettantes of war, torn apart
Send them all to be slaughtered, standard training set
In a dark, distant, foreign shit hole, wretched torment
Approaching the vile sphere of contention
Breathing the smoke, the dust
Blood-soaked earth, stained red oceans, for your insides
Sudden hail, gunfire, half the men drop dead
Troops lost in transport, waste of lives
Terrified grunts die confused
Send them all to be slaughtered
Insufficient base munitions
Compelled by the force to fight 'til death
Certain casualty, amateurs
Who all die before they learn to fight
Ruthless commanders order them to rush
Upon their imminent, abrupt ends
Strategy of attrition, mobbing them
Flailing corpses use up ammunition
Bravery cut in half by enemy artillery
Or cowardice punished by friendly fire
Charge ahead, expending divisions
Impotence, gaining no ground
Bodies thrown, conduct in war, useless
Primitive, only two ways home
Terrified grunts die confused
Reluctant and afraid to attack
How will anyone survive this?
Only hope, victory or death
Certain casualty, amateurs
Who all die before they learn to fight
Ruthless commanders order them to rush
Upon their imminent, abrupt ends
Dying in a dump, ordinance, erode tactics
Know what you must do to survive
Hiding in the dead, lying still, bare cover
Strike in stealth and then disappear
Forge ahead, retiring their forces
Spilling their confounded blood
Undermine their efforts to defeat us
Running gun, only two ways home
Dig in and fire until the way is clear
Pounding the ruins, storms further defaced
Snipers take heads, harass your progress
Take them out, pierce their eyes through their scopes
Die for honor, motherland, strewn about, piles of corpses
Losing every last brave man, better than surrender
Inescapable nightmare, resolve unflinching
Never bow to tyranny, make them pay for every step they take

The future beings now!
The future beings now!
Hour of change, elimination
Eyes of disdain, cruel exploitation
Chaos and bloodshed dominate
Chaos and bloodshed, cause of hate
A new messiah, another lie
A new messiah to be denied
The future beings now!
The future beings now!
Culture deceit, discrimination
A cross to bear, every religion
Chaos and bloodshed dominate
Chaos and bloodshed, cause of hate
A new messiah, another lie
A new messiah to be denied
The future beings now!
Who will be the chosen ones
To be aware and transcend
Who will be the chosen ones
Living in a world without end?
A world without end, A world without end
A new messiah, another lie
A new messiah to be denied
A new messiah,
To be denied!

Hate is all I feel
Disgust is a disease no one can heal
Frustration - no big deal
This suckin' life can't be fuckin' real
Salvation of our sanity
Is what they preach to the silly humanity
But greed and ignorance
Knocks down the level of my tolerance
I don't give a fuck if they endorse political crime
The crap they preach is just like a bad rhyme
Don't trust the one with the smile on the face
Or you'll disappear without a trace
Suffer from this curse - a verdict of my hate
You won't forget this verse - you can't change our fate
You won't forget this words - no one can tell
Deep from my heart I shoot - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets from hell
An ambush - I'm born to scream it out
I ain't no preacher - there's no fuckin' doubt
Listen - to this desperate words
Understand - I hit where it hurts
I don't give a fuck if they endorse political crime
The crap they preach is just like a bad rhyme
Don't trust the one with the smile on the face
Or you'll disappear without a trace
Suffer from this curse - a verdict of my hate
You won't forget this verse - you can't change our fate
You won't forget this words - no one can tell
Deep from my heart I shoot - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets from hell
See - the nightmares I bring
Feel - the unholy sting
Smell - the fragrance of decay
Hear - my screams they will stay
See - the nightmares I bring
Feel - the unholy sting
Smell - the fragrance of decay
Hear - my screams they will stay
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell

It's the night of All Saints' Day
the Graveyard Master is here to stay.
Ritual drums and thunderlights
scan the rhythm on Voo-doo night.
Blood, black magic, drugs and sex:
this is the night of every excess!
When the virgin falls into a trance
all the dead will start to dance!
Dance! Baron Samedi.
Dance! Baron Samedi.
Dance! Baron Samedi.
It's the night of All Saints' Day
the Graveyard Master is here to stay.
Ritual drums and thunderlights
scan the rhythm on Voo-doo night.
Shake your head 'till your mind is blank!
Shake your body and break the rank!
Free yourself in every sense!
Give your soul up to this dance!
Dance! Baron Samedi.
Dance! Baron Samedi.
Dance! Baron Samedi.
I am the Bo-cor, the Deathlord's voice!
I'll lock your soul in my bottle,
then I'll steal your corpse.
Your will, will be mine!
Rest in peace, Baron Samedi!
Come to me, Dead, drom your tombs!

The very maxim of the universe
Portrayed by the greatness the stars rehearse
Premeditated by nature's sense
A modest exuberance so intense
That every mind has failed to grase it
Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack
On every space still to be filled by matter
A pursuance of that very first creation
Expansion and a constant alteration
The fringes of the canvas always stir
The boundary is bathing in a blur

Mother is escorting her child into the grave
Her eyes are filled with tears
She needs neither consolation nor sympathy
Her child has been disgraced
Fragments of life are tearing
Are tearing my legs apart
Life didn't give you what you expected
Time has left you on the moonshine of loneliness
And the way to home is too long
Fragments of life are tearing
Are tearing my legs apart
Durga, God of revenge
Hate, humiliation, shame
Tell my story
Sing about my battles and forgive me what I've done
I don't need this love
I feel only hate and pain
Fragments of life are tearing
Are tearing my legs apart
So you can kill me
Please kill me

the wicked shall return to sheol
even those who forgot of God
the needy not always forgotten
perish not the hope of the afflicted
arise oh God do not let man prevail
judge the wicked before your throne
(chorus)
arise oh God do not let man prevail
the nations shall be judged before thee
put them in fear oh Lord
let the nations know, they are but men
relief to you the afflicted
to us as well as Jesus' return in flaming fire
dealing out - retrebution
to those who do not know God
to those who do not obey
the gospel of our Lord Jesus
(chorus)

A breath of darkness
an existance painted in thriving red
a crown of ivy
and she danced...
the branches trying to catch her
with desirous, clawing dead love
and she tranced...
morbid tales fill her sarcophagus
...midnight...
a timeless crown on the neverworld duchess
dancing she comes to the storm
slithering from the dark of her soul
to the night of the day
bleeding in games
for tomorrow they come to drown her
too long has she had this reign
and the dukes all present their gallant hands
for this, the last drain
a white bedroom lost in thought
of the serpents entwined in yesterdays labyrinth
a semen spell in the cauldron red
starts to bleed a new game
for tomorrow they come to bound her
but this they have always done
and she laughs at their gallant mucus hands
for their night never comes
a white bedroom lost in thought
of the serpents entwined in yesterdays labyrinth
a semen spell in cauldron red
starts to bleed a new game
starts to bleed...

Ten heavy feet walks the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these five warriors march
No matter how much the bleeding wounds
From enemy sword cuts, hurts to the bone
The revenge they sought was taken in blood
No mercy was showed, no mercy was showed
They ignore the pain that hammer like pounds
From falls off slain, horses to the ground
No signs of weakness, no signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless, fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave this land side by side
Now they're headed home, five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left for women to bare
The children cries, they'll live in fear
No man has spared, no house or farm remains
No Christian woman, their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red with enemy blood
It sings of victory granted by the Gods
And as they return bleeding but proud
The horizon turns and the song is ringing loud

How could we lose sight
Of what matters most
Trying not to love
What cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for
If we do not know when to let go
What is this life
That we sling to it so tight
Afraid that it will take from us
These fading sentiments
Can we die to live another day

[music: Lemay / lyrics: Lemay]
Truth before your eyes
Sheltered you in lies
Through the cross, you'll find
The peacefullness once promised
Flesh denied for life
By using Christ as an acolyte
Enrolled in reclusion
Serinity will be just illusion
Upright you praise the serpent
To God, you claimed being a servant
Through sin, within you hold
Your feebleness and filthy soul
Why preaching about love and hate
When blindness enlighten your own faith
Inverted behavior
Integrety is the only saviour
Deep, is, your devotion
For the lefthand side
Peace, you connot give
To the confessed ones
False, is, your compassion
For the crucified
In which your trueself
Will persist to hide
Truth before your eyes
Sheltered you in lies
Through the cross, you'll find
The peacefullness once promised
Flesh denied for life
By using Christ as an acolyte
Enrolled in reclusion
Serinity will be just illusion

Ear at the voice inside
Dig a deeper tomb and all the self can finally resonate, resonate, resonate, resonate
Tread on the path of pride
You can be the god and let the faith become your enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy
Breathe redemption into wasted life
Closer, closer
Find the wrath of God inside your eyes
Closer, closer
[Chorus]
Breathe deep
And as the fear before you falls
I know the pain is so unsettling
Breathe deep
So now you've built a thousand walls
But in the end it's all unraveling
Stand with a worthless sign
Wave it in the path of every face you cannot tolerate, tolerate, tolerate, tolerate
Breathe redemption into wasted life
Closer, closer
Find the wrath of God inside your eyes
Closer, closer
[Chorus]
This is the last day that you will regret
Wake from your sleep and never forget
This is the last day that you will regret
Closer, closer
[Chorus]
Closer, closer, closer, closer

Sacrifice,can you feel the hand
Of god oppose your will to die...
Your time has now come...
You are Satan's son,
The end of life is near, your death is clear
The time of life is short, you are now reborn
Time to die, hear the cries, damned souls
Returning from inside. You can't escape
Though you try, there's nothing left but to die
Your time has come you are Satan's son
You feel the hand of god oppose you will to die
Your life is now here your rebirth is clear
Time to die, hear the cries
Damned souls returning from inside

Lord below, your abysmal horrors we call forth
Awaken -- rise up and cleanse this earth with fire
The taste of victory awaits our wicked tongues
As you sleep beyond the light your blessed idol acts agent to your will
For vast aeons has slept, lurking 'neath the haunted deep
Sea soaked perversion, arise
Named of the foulest tongue, his will ebbs within me
Beckoning -- what was shall once more be
In the house of the dead you lie and wait
Oh lords of black earth
Controlling the minds of the meek
Staining this planet with visions of murder and hate
For vast aeons has slept, lurking 'neath the haunted deep
Sea soaked perversion, arise
Named of the foulest tongue, his will ebbs within me
Beckoning -- what was shall once more be
We pray for the earth to open
Free you of your ageless tomb
Our knees bent in your worship
Oh great gold one, I scream for your return
Madness unhallowed
Ascending moon of darkness never to wane
Lurking without end
Behind life in time and space
An evil so vast
Beyond man's power to bear
An essence insane
Dethrone the sovereign -- and with your might reclaim
I serve allegiance to your will
I scream the incantations
Lord unholy, your horrors I invoke
Come forth my lord
In praise we sing of your return

(feat. Chad Gray from Mudvayne)
Tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit
I'll show no allegiance
All shall feel my wrath
Ten years of a discontent never given a change
Love is passion
Love is vengeance
Love I shall forsake
And on this day I'll slit my wrist
And do away with everything
Now fuckers
Cut up
Beating
Bleeding
Lost our empathy
Now fuckers
Defeated
Beat up
Cheated
No more sympathy
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit
Fuck all of the people driven by the greed
They will all be dealt with accordingly
Just let them be
Now fuckers
Cut up
Beating
Bleeding
Lost our empathy
Now fuckers
Defeated
Beat up
Cheated
No more sympathy
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of people trying to take a piece
a piece
Just so sick and tired
Just hopeless, sick and tired
Wage war on the bastards
Wage war on the street
Wage war all around you
Wage war on the weak
(the weak)
Tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit
Well now hear me call
Wage the war on the bastards
You wage the war on the street
Wage the war all around you
Wage the war on the weak
weak (repeated until end of song)
(Wage the war on the bastards)
(You wage the war on the street)
(You fucking wage the war on the bastards)
(Wage the war all around you)
(You fucking wage the war on the street)
(You fucking wage the war on the bastard)

you are nothing more than dying royalty
you are nothing more than a fading drama queen
your spelling errors in love letters just stole your crown
you are nothing more than late night fantasy
you are nothing more than a rehearsed tragedy
your spelling errors in love letters just killed your dream
just killed you
you are nothing more than a dim lit whore
you are nothing more than a crashing bore
in your blood paid
you chase a shadow that will fade out as pain

Our peace
Is now in pieces
But what else would
You expect
But we're nothing
Nothing in truth
Here comes
The internal
Winter
Where innocence forgets

You know you got my mones all buzzin', babe,
Just thinking about your lovin, babe,
(just thinking about your lovin, babe)
Girl, I can't seem to get you of my mind,
Got thoughts workin overtime,
(got my thoughts working overtime)
You feed me the love my soul needs to survive,
All I need right now, babe...
Just a little more time with you,
Wanna make love with you,
You'll never know just how I feel,
Till I show this love's for real,
Just a little more time with you,
Let me get you in the mood,
'cause I'll leave you in no doubt,
That it's me you can't do without,
Just a little more time without you...
What we've got is sweet as honey, babe,
We don't need nothin' babe,
(we don't need we don't need nothin, babe)
I take the blame for what you've been going through,
For being such a fool to you,
(I know I've been such a fool to you)
Sometimes as a man, we all make the same mistakes,
I just hope it's not too late...
Just a little more time with you,
Wanna make love with you,
You'll never know just how I feel,
Till I show this love's for real,
Just a little more time with you,
Let me get you in the mood,
'cause I'll leave you in no doubt,
That it's me you can't do without,
Just a little more time without you...
You're the only thing that I've ever craved,
Only thing, only thing,
So I'm asking you,
Please don't take it away,
Not this time,
Tell mewhat to do to prove my love for you,
Gonna prove my love to you, babe,
Even if you asked me to fly,
I would fly...
Just a little more time with you,
Wanna make love with you,
You'll never know just how I feel,
Till I show this love's for real,
Just a little more time with you,
Let me get you in the mood,
'cause I'll leave you in no doubt,
That it's me you can't do without,
Just a little more time without you...

where were the eyes that followed
how could they've found?
these misery's merchants
struck the message deep
"we have come to stay"
dogs fled there in the dark of his path
feared him as once they all did
like a ghost in daylight
on an overcrowded street
he wishes
to be something he is not
lie a shadow at midnight
that originate in air
he wishes to release
deep in the back it had caught him
the anchor they threw at his life
oh these misery's merchants
dragged through life as a burden
rushed off to his cage of glass
to open the single window
a means of escape, out in the open
there are still holes in these walls
puking information into the unwanting
probing the last hope of defence
so he plugged up the holes
shut the outside window
in doing that, madness payed a visit
...and then suddenly in mid-thought
escape was a factor and as from inside
pushing out were words
through fingers came uncovering
revealing the truth of him there in the dark...
skin began to crawl as they neared him
is all pleasure release?
oh these misery's merchants
saw the message clear
"it is time to pay"
like a ghost in daylight
on an overcrowded street

Master, take wing over the desert
And parched land
Master the art of suffering
A divine dance
Summon the master
Mouth incendiary evocation
Black flame engulfs
Filth and maggots of humanity
Hair burning, faces melt
Summon
Master
The inexhaustible beauty
The incomparable gift
Satan has made to the human race
In his only child, antichrist
Mouth incendiary evocation
Black flame engulfs
Filth and maggots of humanity
Hair burning, faces melt
Obscene ritual
Totems sacrosanct
Divine Baphomet
Worship the Goatlord
Divine Lucifer
Worship the Goatlord
Swarming, the spirits of the pit
Infernal, arise from the abyss
Absonant, within the Pentagram
Ritually summon the Antichrist
The wings of the master

Annihilation of our existence
Existing like species before us
The apocalipse is unescapable
Mimic of generations that past
Useless nerves reayd to feel
The infliction of life
The end of all

I am gone, I am sold
Can I take her home while I am sleeping?
I put it on, fits so well
Dead fish floating up to the ceiling
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Such a beautiful violence, moving in
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Prettiest thing, I'm moving in
I put it on, it fits my soul
You know she spoke these words
While she was sleeping
I put it on, it fits my soul, I put it on
You know she spoke these words
While she was sleeping
Razor's edge, sliding in, razor's edge
Wanna feel my fingers dipping in
Dip in
Dipping in
Dip in
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Such a beautiful violence coming in
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Such a beautiful violence moving in
Dip in
Dipping in
Dip in
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Never say never, do it again
Never say never, do it again
Never say never, do it again
Dip in
Dipping in
Dip in
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Prettiest thing, I'm moving in
She's the prettiest thing, I've ever seen
Prettiest thing, I'm coming in

Your night is eternal
Dawn is never to be seen
Hide in isolation
Chase the dragon in your dream
A willing slave to darkness
A pleasure sacrifice
Kneel and beg the master
To look the dragon into the eyes
Hollow man
Dragon man
Hollow man
The fire inside is raging
Lurking in your hearts
Burning up your life
Pain becomes your parts
Cold hands that embrace you
A pleasure sacrifice
It's a half man who is begging
To look the dragon into the eyes
Hollow man
Dragon man
Hollow man
Dragon man
A pleasure sacrifice
Once started as the hunter
You soon became the prey
You cannot understands
As your vision fades away
But the hunger is still raging
To feed it is your strife
Chase the dragon for the last time
Your final act in life
Hollow man
Dragon man
Hollow man
Dragon man
A pleasure sacrifice, a pleasure sacrifice

Visions.
Cryptic writings protect my life.
Clairvoyance is equal to evil.
Visions of the antichrist flash through my mind.
A great global fire.
Nostradamus, has a view of ages.
Nostradamus, knows when we'll die.

Plugged into the socket
Leads attached to twisting skin
Ignite the squirming foetus
To dissolve it from within
The uterus aspirated...foeticide
Suction catheter eradicating...your insides
Foeticides done daily
Frying them inside the womb
Electrocuting embryos
In their sterile tomb
Your cervix an abscess... foeticide
Pumped out by your gynaecologist... your insides
Spasmodic convulsions of pleasure are gained
Pumping out the boiling gunge as you languish in pain
Scouring out the womb from effervescing rot
Scrubbing-brush comes in handy to clean out all the clots
Electrodes buzz with power
Visceral muscle is charred black
Melting bone, frying aqueous humour
A dignified death is what you lack

Drawing from the truth
Innocent few cast their chips in
Praying, count accounts
Believe in something for a price
Cop out
Broken dreams
Deceiving more
You've raped their hearts and soul
Capitalize
False gimmick for the weak and needy
Blind angel
The shortest distance from the truth
Rotted minds
Believe your loaded lot of shit
Forgotten few
Sorry victims of divine crimes pay their lives
Capitalize
False gimmick for the weak and needy
Blind angel
The shortest distance from the truth
Rotted minds
Believe your loaded lot of shit
Forgotten few
Sorry victims of divine crimes pay their lives
You're faceless beyond crimes
You've taken on a new level
Hatred, more spite than any other
Gutless, dying victims
Hollow shells, empty lives
Lifeless lives

Great and pounding in its way
Stirring the roaming cosmic sea
Oceans rise, planets igneous fall
As chaos and beauty in fierce rage
Furious are the storms
Forever its rage carries on
Disintergrating to create, upon fate
Wearing the web of solar cast
Hasting the view of Everlast
Exploding Imploding
Ascending, Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding Imploding
Poised in all chaos directions
In fierce affection
Spawning the orbs of furious light
My sons of fire, you're children of the storm
Breeder of life, harvester of all
The last breath of the fall
Exploding Imploding
Ascending, Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding Imploding
Poised in all chaos directions
In fierce affection
Weaving the web of solar cast
Hasting the views of Everlast

Faking the truth in their eyes
Smile but they really deride
Never give you shelter
Lady all alone, naked to the bone
Make you bleed and melt into tears
Down on your knees you will see
What you could be
Raise the power in your eyes
Make us rise to make us say
Down and alone, arrows fly
Breaking on my soul
Down and alone, arrows fly
I remember times
When arrows hit me causing pain
All alone I've found my soul
And now my soul is sane
The night has come down on the land
I want to reach out for her land
But she takes another
Lonesome in my room, staring at the moon
Treated like a bother
Down on my knees I have seen
What I can be
Raise the power in my eyes
Makes me rise to make me say
Down and alone, arrows fly
Breaking on my soul
Down and alone, arrows fly
I remember times
When arrows hit me causing pain
All alone I've found my soul
And now my soul is sane
Down and alone, arrows fly
Breaking on my soul
Down and alone, arrows fly
I remember times
When arrows hit me causing pain
All alone I've found my soul
And now my soul is sane
(Isn't loneliness a good reason to become acquainted with yourself?
And when you're down and out, aren't you compelled to face yourself?
And if you know yourself, can the arrows of the world outside hurt you anymore?)

There are no boundaries to how far I will go,
Caught in the clutch of a raging libido,
Tongue subjected to cunnilingus,
Around the rim, accidental anilingus,
I live a life of pornography,
Making explicit smut a reality,
A deep sexual hunger must be satiated,
Beyond anything fantasized or masturbated,
An ensueing orgy of impure fornication,
Indecent indulgences in sexual gratification,
Intertwined limbs writhe belly to belly,
Intercourse positions of unwholesome carnality,
Pink tender openings fingered, licked and fucked,
My hot, hard phallus lovingly sucked,
Wet quivering quim, every orifice I lubricate,
Orally, vaginally, and anally I penetrate,
In every luscious hole, I ejaculate,
The perversions of Eros I celebrate,
I long to lap up the sweet nectar of her loins,
Yearning to lengthily chow on musky cooze,
Gormandizing on the overflowing font of a greasy gorge,
Drinking the delicious poontang of a harlot's slit-dish,
I deviate, experimenting in every aspect,
Fucking every furrowon soft ass meat,
Beyond anything fantasized or masturbated,
An ensueing orgy of impure fornication,
Indecent indulgences in sexual gratification,
Intertwined limbs writhe belly to belly,
Intercourse positions of unwholesome carnality,
Pink tender openings fingered, licked and fucked,
My pud-butter into every dumphole I find,
My engorged, swollen beef-baton gives a colon choking reaming,
Skin folds and cracks caulk with flowing jism,
I toil for a mutual climax,
Aroused by inflicting others with sadism,
Pleasure from pain, victimized by masochism,
Erotic extremes accelerate into hypereroticism,
I lose myself as I stare with vivid voyuerism,
As two curvaceous tarts embrace in Sapphism,
Truly engulfed with incontinence,
Letting loose my hunger by prurience,
Upon moist, fleshy gash I prolifigrate,
The meatus of a virgin vulvae pulls me in,
Majoras and nymphas hold me tight,
Nymphomania rages as I insanely copulate,
Swelling with the searing heat of my sexual instinct,
Beyond anything fantasized or masturbated,
An ensueing orgy of impure fornication,
Indecent indulgences in sexual gratification,
Intertwined limbs writhe belly to belly,
Intercourse positions of unwholesome carnality,
Pink tender openings fingered, licked and fucked,
My implacable thrusts batters the maidenhead to pieces,
Screams beg me to stop, another vaginal defeat,
As I pull out raw, blood spews from my meat,
Just another vaginal defeat.

We have lost ourselves to their game
Everyday it's always the same, I see the truth and it's slipping away
It's time we learn how to separate
We have to separate and give it away,
Unlearn the prophecy that we no longer have to pray, to you
We need a fire in our hearts, we need renewal for our souls
We have lost ourselves to our game
It's time we rejoice in giving away,
alive in Christ we know he's the way, we all know today is the day
We have to separate and give it away,
Unlearn the prophecy that we no longer have to pray, to you
Give to Caesar what is his
Give to Jesus all you are

Contained in blood scrawl, compiled evil artifacts.
Insane instigators of ritualistic pacts.
Necronomicon, bestial methods, age old torrid acts.
If darker side thus beckon, in limbo boundaries must be smashed!
Delving demonic entrance, connecting incantations.
(You're the) Doorway for unbeings past.
Induce, recite, summon reprise.
Bid welcome to Candarian 'Guise.
Possession escalates, your confused eyes revert.
Senses nulled, inert.
Induce, recite, summon reprise.
Bid welcome to Candarian 'Guise.
Your soul now quoshed, with blinded eyes.
Your grasp impaired enlightenment.
Demonicus mortal.

So can you tell me how you feel inside the beat of a child
Or is it more dead then alive, fashioned in a sinful style
I don't care - NO
Not at all
I care of nothing
So can you persuade me
I will for the dying..
No star for the blackened youth
The empyrean x-ray
Yeah, distorted on hell's use
The empyrean x-ray
No mirror for the blinded youth, or that fucked up truth
No hearts for the willing to live, from more than this world can give
I don't care - NO
Not at all
I care of nothing
So can you persuade me
A will for the dying
No star for the blackened youth
The empyrean x-ray
Yearh, distorted on hell's use
The empyrean x-ray
A design for the broken, a fistful of darkness for life
Burnt out sick and frozen, can you feel the hatred
No star for the blackened youth
The empyrean x-ray
Yeah, distorted on hell's use
The empyrean x-ray

Hold on to everything you have, before it slips through your hands.
Untold the story of the blood, shed to serve desires of greater man.
For all the time the gold refined, still we cry, consuming more, as we stay poor.
They've locked the door.
Fight for your life, no more we'll close our eyes 'til Sunday.
While people die poor everyday, your lies will never feed my family.
Still fight to make a better way.
They've taken away all I have.

Longing for silence...
"Always faster" is the way that we go.
Not a little patience...
Higher, farer, better we grow.
The beast is rising. It?s tantalizing
those who are taking the time.
Alienation... A revelation...
Straight to the end of the line...
Fly! Riding away... Rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye.
Fly! Riding away... Rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye.
Cast out from Eden...
You don't like what we are in your eyes.
We're leading the treason on the race you run,
the way of your life.
I am danger, I'm a stranger
cause I don't give in to your call.
And not until she is satisfied
we can come and explode and we fall!!!
We're blowing the frame of your headless game:
We don't follow!
(...In their eyes we are insane! But aren't daydreamers only the escapists of
a soulless view of life?...)

Such a fool
To think that I could go through life alone
A typical rash decision
I refused to see
How I needed your hand
To complete
And reinforce my existence
Whats left to say
Except for youre the reason
The reason for me being
You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better
Searching for another way
To steal a second chance
I pray for absolution
Now I know
That I'm missing your
Calm clarity
You were the one that listened
What's left to say
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me being
You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better
What's left to say
Except for you're the reason
Except for you're the reason
Nothing I could say
Could bring you back tomorrow
Nothing I could say
Could dissipate my sorrow
All I had to
Do was let you know
What's left to say
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me being
You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better

Couloured chambers, Fine illusions, or a gate to space
Endless stairways, fine delusions, all under my command
I'd change the sky to paint it red
I'd change the colours of life, and play with time
It's all mine!
It's only everything, all that I wanted to be
Cause it's only everything
And wise, wiser than time, wiser than life, wiser than me, only me...
This is the end of all reason, the inner mirror reveals
There's more beyond what you're sure of, the fantasy of dreams
It's always there, the only emotion we all seem to keep down
There, while exploring dimensions
There is more, only everything
Dream! As bright or dark, as warm or hard the mind is set on
Dream! You lose control, you lose your freedom to confine it
I don't want to see this, I don't want this pain I never knew before
Feel, we're on the loose
Impressions are enlarged
I don't want to hear this, I don't want to dream to feel this again
Or to get a taste
This could be the end of all reason, the inner mirror reveals
There's more beyond what you're sure of, the fantasy of dreams
It's always there, the only emotion we all seem to keep down
There, still exploring dimensions
There is more, only everything
Become me, come feel along with all you see
Control me, control the keys
Do you dare to be
So deep, will you surrender now to your sleep?
Re-live your daydreams and
Come join this inner wonderland
Come let every emotion stand
To be right under your command
To let out fantasies
To change them into mysteries
Where time loses all memories
To luck and bitter agony
Re-live your daydreams awake
So join the magic of your life
Just dare to take the inner drive
To see it's only everything you can be doing tonight
Dream! as cool or hot, as smooth or rough the mind's creating
Dream! Enjoy the ride, enjoy the boundless journey you can make
I can be the maker, I can be the queen of time and twisted games
See you're on the loose
Images enlarged
I will need no reason
I just need the mirror inside me to reveal what's down below
This must be the end of all reason, the inner mirror reveals
There's more beyond what you're sure of, the fantasy of dreams
It's always there, the only emotion we all seem to keep down
There, while exploring dimensions
There is more, only everything

Just take it in stride
One breath and I think I feel free
All we can do is strive for the best thoughts
The best feelings, the warm fuzzy feeling
As a child, I believed these all came to me
Due to the process of living
Grab the wheel right now and make this life yours
Walk with me, leave your disgusting fever
Take this life, make it yours
Forgotten are the days of wandering pointlessly
In my dreams
Carry me with your wings

Incantations of evil
Spells black of Satan
Satanic power from hell
From dark crystal rooms
Black souls of darkness
Dark ones of evil
Baptized in fire
Mystical death you will die!
Black Arts
Rituals are going
Hexcrafting and cursing
Proclaiming your death
Magick, hate and death
Black Arts

The journey takes now many days and nights
Near the mountains, which stand majestic before them
They realize the wolves cry
Listen my son, the first trial is near
An old majestic oak protects them for the crawling dusk
The cries come nearer and nearer
Pulsating blood is what the wolves are scenting
Raging desire drives them forward
A black wolf jumps out of the thicket
As fast as he can, Narog shots an arrow
Which smashes the wolves heart
Encouraged Tyrael takes a dagger
Side by side they fight against the beasts
Side by side a fight over life and death
Screams run through the dark, cold night
Blood splashed swords splatter the bodies of the beasts
The moon let their claws glitter like steel
Their desire for fresh flesh was finished by a bloody fight
Side by side they defeat the beasts
Side by side they sow the ground with death
Once my son will become a great warrior
Protect me from the beast give me power to defeat
This night and all nights which will come
Oh, my Master in Asgard, give me power for this run

Feed me and rape me and rope me
As a family we will hang together
As a genus we will bleed together
We have settled for less

We exist to destroy, fuck you all
Fuck you all
This prophecy unfolding,
We have no time to wait
The world is dead and rotting,
A lifeless tomb remains
We have no compassion,
Hate runs through our veins
Faceless and abandoned,
We can not be saved
Rise above this waste,
A reformation spreads across
This earth, all consuming
No return, we are the resurrected
Strong with hate we kill the ones
That keep us down
With the body we embrace what
Pleasure gives, no god wants us
Penetrate so deep inside your twisted
Flesh, weak and worthless
Terrified, how you tremble at the
Sight of me, you can not know
What I am, I fucking laugh and
Watch you bleed
No expression, no compassion,
Born to kill
My instinct is your end, hell awaits
Feel your life slip away,
Start to pray
No one hears, no one cares,
No one lives
Watch and wait, the embodiment
Of hate burns inside,
No one is left alive, revenge
Karma kills revenge
Cause-effect... Revenge life to death
One by one they all will fall when I
Get the fucks I'll crucify them all
Take the best motherfucker they got
Kick him in the face and hang him out to rot
I want you to die, and no motherfucker
Should have to question why
Your lives not worth fuck,
Just grab another bitch
And bust another nut
Why can't you fucking go and die,
Your life's worth less than my shit
God can't help, you pretentious fuck
Pools of red, at my feet,
Flesh with flesh, meat on meat
No fucker in this world
I call my friend
The bitches and sluts are fucking dead
Another fucker's talking shit again
A bullet in the head (is what he gets)
Fuck you all, eat my shit
I remain throughout time,
Pure with hate, I cross all lines
They can't remember, I won't forget
The fallen and forgotten,
Forever laid to rest
You won't be the last fucking one
To challenge my hate
Your weakness is just what I need
To terminate
Kill and fucking rape,
Fuckers hit the dust
When they fuck with us
Kill, fuck, maim, tear, fuck you all,
I don't care

Help me, I am watching atomic warfare from the safety of the moon
I am dancing sacrilegiously o' the sound of infectious tunes
There is no sunset, is no sunrise, things on earth don't seem as they are
The opal planet I once called home is now revolving a dying star
Strange, awakening from cryonic sleep, I vacate my homely hemisphere
My soul travels on turbulent thoughts whilst my innards remain here
I feel pity for the ignorant one who leaves the egg but the shell remains
The severance of umbilical ties multiples his deepest pains
Through the eyes in my head I hear the purple flower's scent
Casting shadows in the shade, lusting for the gates of jade
Through hallucinative wealth I cannot comprehend myself
Sterility, fertility, the life that dwells inside of me
I often stop to wonder whilst gazing to the sky
Is there life beyond the quasars, will I find out when I die?
Is there a being out there who gaze into the night
And see our burning star as a tiny spark of light?

Feeling now
The star light fade away
Crying now
There is no way to feel
Sadness that makes me down
The moon light up the headstone
You just walk away
I'm alone
Your soul just goes away
I'm alone
The silence means the prayer
Sadness that makes me down
The moon light up the headstone
You just walk away
I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
Cry for eternal regret
I'm alone Your sould just goes away
I'm alone
The silence means the prayer
Sadness that makes me down
The moon lights up the headstone
you just walk away
I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
Cry for eternal regret
I find the way for me
The regret prompts for the make my mind
Gripping tight my sword to fight
Can you feel?
Now i just stand to make a chance
I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
Cry for eternal regret

I will testify though I walk this road alone
Though all my brothers fade away, I will hold to you
Conviction has stripped away with time
The flame of passionate love
That once burned deep inside has blown away
And washed out with the rain
The tower of your faith has crumbled to the ground
Crushing those that held to you
And in your place, we dug a shallow grave
Hoping to see a change, a resurrection
And so we fight for the heart
Holding nothing back till we see the sun on the horizon
Bringing light to this barren wasteland, power of ages old
Held in the mighty hands of God
Pushed out and thrown away like a painful memory
Two feet in the grave we march relentlessly
Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation
Two feet in the grave we march relentlessly
Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation
Broken in two, our faith has fallen victim to shame
Run from the truth, run from the freedom of absolutes
Is there anyone left who still cares?
Reconcile, take back our stolen hearts
Reconcile, take back what is rightfully yours
Set apart
Set us apart, set us apart
Set apart our hearts only for you

I made a pact not to sleep through the end
All of the dreamers are stuck in their beds
Fight off the attraction to always play dead
I'm tortured by white noise in half hour sets
Ears ringing, your mouth ran for miles
But hasn't gone anywhere, you're lost
I heard the word on the street
And it means nothing to me
So how do you like me now?
Where's your passion?
The renaissance man is a thing of the past
To you it's fashion
Dress up, don't address
What keeps us from resting
The jackals circle for the feast
I try to fight it off but it's consuming me
The rapture has only begun
While you sleep, they watch you breathing
And you can bet it gets worse
When the moon crashes into the sun
While you dream, both ends are burning
Pray for one more chance
They will steal the air from your lungs
In the back of the hearse
Overturned as your insides prolapse
Wake before, before it's too fucking late
When everyone has a skeleton key
When everyone rots in captivity
When everyone is sleeping off the heat
You shut the blinds
As they cauterize what lives inside
You shut the blinds
As they cauterize what lives inside

Out in the school yard little Peaches play
Rubbing their beaves, they got a lot to say
Never doing work, teachers are mad
Really don't care 'cause they're never sad
Little school Peaches take a word from me
Got to do your work and that's the way to be
School Love
School Love
Caught in the can having some fun
Teachers on the prowl now you gotta run
Underneath the stairs safety for awhile
Feeling each other 'cause that's your style
Now that you are caught, caught in the act
Gonna be strapped and that's a fact
School Love
School Love
School Love

Lost on a voyage with no destiny,
Forgotten original ideology.
generations born and died,
Their intentions misplaced through time,
Another world falls to its knees,
With vast contempt your hatred breads,
Nothing left for us to slaughter
Annihilation achieved
Where next to conquer?
Civilisations of the past'
Faced attrition now ripped apart,
Moving onwards to another war,
Into battle to die once more.
An endless spiral of depravity,
Mankind's journey throughout infinity.
Where next to conquer?

What are these penetrating colors
Of this soundscaping noisefloor?
Is this the old empty future
or the black eletric nature?
Colors circulate inside of O
Ambient mind, the overdose
(...and I was injected with silence)
Are we all elastic worms
In this red tekknostorm?
Are there any energetic atoms
In this paradoxical zone?
Can the relapse of spasms
Be the rhythm of this dance?
Is this the neo-cultural spacetrip
Or the perpetual trancegrip?
Is the echo a shadow of presence
Or a soundtrack for nonexistance
Are the voices orchestral nightmares
Or synonyms to black and white faces?
Color circulate inside of O
Anbient mind, the overdose
(... and along came the spasms)
Are we all elastic worms
In this red tekknostorm?
Are there any energetic atoms
In this paradoxical zone?

We will set this world ablaze.
Everyone has the chance to make a difference, everyone has a chance to change.
When you retrace the steps of your life, will you have used every opportunity given?
Mediocrity is a choice that you must not make.
Take your chance to make a change, be an example of what's within.
Live what you preach and preach what you live.
Let your words be the spark but let your actions be the flame that will burn the truth into the world.
Don't let your silence be a tool for the enemy.
Always speak the truth.
And with the flame of the truth burning within our hearts we will set this world ablaze.

The wake up means walking on the edge.
Wrong decissions running through my veins.
Immortal sorrow scars on my soul.
Rejected and trapped in myself.
Black velvet was the gift of the time.
Nothing left to loose.
Nothing to believe.
Hands tied feet chained.
Hiding behind shadows of anger.
To wake up means walking on the edge.
But I often feel that misery.
It's the most important part of being happy!

Show no serenity
For medicating thoughts of a real life
Beyond the ruins lies our victory just out of reach
Forgotten saviour
Nothing could purify your actions
Nothing to prove (nothing to prove)
Betrayal left you out in the frame
We seem surprised at the nature of man
When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand
No more will I wake up feeling empty and dead
Make reason of your lies and carry you up instead
The sole survivors
Will try to resurrect broken thoughts
Before the dream is complete I see you sifting through the ashes
I need more time
I ask of you nothing more than freedom
From you chains (my life will change)
Into intuitive reasoning
We seem surprised at the nature of man
When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand
No more will I wake up feeling empty and dead
Make reason of your lies and carry you up instead
You take too long to pray
You wait too long today
Too long to today
As you wait for acceptance
Your shit in life, you sellout all your pride
For the God in the Frame.

I knew something was wrong
when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.
Dead giveaway, dead giveaway.
My neighbor got big testicles cause we see this dude every day.
We eat ribs with this dude, but we didn't have a clue
that that girl was in that house. She said: please help me get out!
Dead giveaway, dead giveaway, Dead giveaway, dead giveaway, Dead giveaway, dead giveaway,
Dead giveaway, dead giveaway.
My neighbor got big testicles cause we see this dude every day.
We eat ribs with this dude, but we didn't have a clue
that that girl was in that house. She said please help me get out!
So I opened the door, we can't get in that way
a body can't fit through the door, only your hand.
So we kick-kicked the bottom and she comes out, and she says:
it's some more girls up in that house, call 911 and they caught him at McDonalds.
I knew something was wrong

The incomprehensibility of
A love so pure
Too good to be true
It seems
This preposterous act of empathy
Unveiling my insufficiency
The will of God accomplished
Redemption revealed
Realize, repent, receive
Confession of inadequacy
Initiate, admit, believe
I am not my own
- I belong to he who sacrificed
The glory of eternity and fullness of peace
To fathom this mystery
Is beyond what I can express
That he'd endure this path of pain
Realize, repent, receive
Confession of inadequacy
Initiate, admit, believe
Freedom
The incarnation of the one I am?
Inverting the course of history
Hiding the kingdom in the heart of man
For him to share the grace of God

Hideous crimes an' atrocities
The slaughter of millions beyond belief
Those were dark times so different from now
The law of evil ruled our fatherland
I was but a pawn in their game
Why should I feel any guilt?
Still when I close, close my eyes
The words unfold, it all comes back
I can't defy it, can't deny it
I know it to be true
In my sleep they come to haunt me
They know it to be true
Tears of the dead
We are all on the turning wheel of fate
A young man standing proud in uniform
I never stopped to hesitate
Until it was far too late
I was but a pawn in their game
Why should I feel any guilt?
Still when I close, close my eyes
The words unfold, it all comes back
I can't defy it, can't deny it
I know it to be true
In my sleep they come to haunt me
They know it to be true
Tears of the dead
My hands are soiled, covered in blood
Stains that never wash away
Their hollow eyes confronting me
Judging me
Now an old man at the end of my days
Contemplating my life of sin
Living is never simple, the road is hard
I had no say, just a puppet in a sick play
I was but a pawn in their game
Why should I feel any guilt?
Still when I close, close my eyes
The words unfold, it all comes back
I can't defy it, can't deny it
I know it to be true
In my sleep they come to haunt me
They know it to be true
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
(Tears of the dead)
Tears of the dead

Take a trip with me, to endless insanity

The time drifts backwards, to the moment of nothingness.
Only weeping and silent questions in the deep, deep dark.
[Chorus]
There, somewhere, in the whirlwind of pain
her face gleams of satisfaction,
victory and glory light the hollow fields.
In the glow of the flames sounds the avalanche of thoughts.
For the moment of it`s birth
the heaven there awaits for nothing,
only calmness and the everlasting flow of the time dance,
wrap and join in it`s force.

There, somewhere, in the...
She casts the shadows, of the eternal night upon their souls.
The innocents yeild, drown in their benevolence.
For our hearts we wish the pain to bring the wisdom,
to give it`s power to crush the feeble,
in the void there is the lust of the dark.
[Chorus]
There, somewhere, in the...

The Public wants what the public gets.
Lazarus himself wouldn't rise into this world.
Decry relativity damned petulant for seeing through a
Trojan horse full of zyklon while Judas' coffers overflow.
What? New world disorder is nothing new.
Choking on poison air pouring whiskey into
Crescent moon lacerations.
Time to bite the hand that beats.
Teach our
Children well, teach them to kill.
Global jihad for a thousand years.
Sanctified our blood spills, sutured with commodities.
Iron fist in silken
Glove ripping away autonomy,
Replacing with a placebo.
Realize that our wounds will never heal while Judas' coffers overflow.

Moonlight...
Descends in the land of shadow
Full moon is rising
Over blood red skies
Wolves...
Cries in the freezing night
Gathered in twilight
To summon the master below
Rising shadows
Over blood red skies
Mournful cries
Through the darkened night
Darkness...
Spreads in a shape of evil
Over the rising kingdom
Transylvania
Shadow...
Surrounds the ancient castle
The palace of death far away
Where no light exists
In the realms of Transylvania
Purest blood shall flow
Mortals shall feed
Hunger undead souls
Shadows...
Over Transylvania
Darkness...
In the land of frost
Whispers...
In the winds of evil
Storms...
In the blood red skies

now i know the consequence of my sins.
take me lord just as i am.
only you can see through into my mind and through all the lies.
and you looking into my heart where we start to breakdown.
peering through my heart now i know the consequences of my sins once before but
never again.

Let the blackness roll on
Mother's cool reptilian womb
Ain't so cold tonight (yeaaah!)
My fingers trace the exit wounds
by graveyard light
There's bone dust in my throat and everything is dead
but it's all right
Take it easy
You bleed so easy..
Bleed me an ocean
Bleed me an ocean tonight
By electric graveyard light
Bleed me an ocean
Let me lie beneath the sky
Teach me how to die
Bleed me an ocean
As the blossom eats the butterfly
Can you feel the cold death
That rides along your spine
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
Let the blackness roll on
I was sexless in clouds again
I was chasing a cold, cold wind
I've become bored with flesh and bone again
The deepest alone
I was riding the turbulence
an ocean of Hades
it's all downhill from here
on the outer nowhere
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
Let the blackness roll on
I was stoned to the drone
of the blackness that hums
I've become bored with flesh and bone again
The endless hum of the highway drone
I was riding the turbulence
an ocean of Hades
The taste of dead sex on my tongue
On my tongue, yeah
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
Just like a rain drop
I was born baby to fall
and scale these prison walls
It was over before you were born
Sucked into the vacuum of this universal tomb
It was over before you were born
Sucked into the vacuum of this universal tomb
Old blossom dies
Like a young man bleeds
The insects hum with their hunger and grieve
An icon of pale bone
Static white dream
Blind in the wilderness
Everybody scream
I couldn't find my way
Out the door
We all died
Woke up on the floor
yeah alright yeah
yeah alright yeah(eha yeahhh)
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream

[Satyricon Cover]
Scornful, relentless memory
Ripped of all but drive
Undressed by betrayal
Zero tolerance for the souldead
Wish I was the violence,
inflicted upon you
Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind
Little you,
still like a claw in my eye
Pulsating organic rage
I should have let you off of the hook
Mind drifts
into dynamic pain
Universal onslaught
I'm on my own (One soul, one hate)
Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind
Damnation, holocaust
Devil horns for you to ride
Time for the angel
to spread his wings and fly
World opponent,
wishmaster of gruesome pain
Stormtroops' frantic fury,
demoniac spitfire!
Abortion of religious life, distinguish the rot
I hate you
to a level of intoxication
Don't feel alone,
I've got enough
I wish you slow death,
slow death by grinding
Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind

Snorting the stench of latent effluvium
And maturing damp fumes
This foul menage forces tears to your eyes
As the corpse's gas are exhumed
Intoxicated by foul body odors
And the nauseating tepid whiff
Pinching your nostrils as you irrigate flatus
From the emaciated stiff
Volatile entrails fume and steam
As they're meticulously hacked during discussion
Evaporating sludge and bubbling pus
A rotten gaseous expiration
Maturating corpse, the stale smell of decay and rot
A sickening asphyxiation
Gross remains gush, innards turn to sludge
With partial liquefaction
Smell the rot
Of the corrupted corpse
Hallucinogenic trip
Tissue gases leak, a warm, unpleasant reek
A quite macabre addiction
Deteriorated, bloated corpse, decomposure burning hot
Sniff the smell of carrion
Inhaling the dank smells
As you gouge out the dripping innards with glee
Succumbing to a trans lucid state
As you sniff the aroma of necropsy
Bacterial decomposition
The aroma of fungal, larval infestation
Consuming, ripening slime
As the cadaver is slowly wasting
Your sore sinews rot, blood curdling coughs
As acrid foetor corrodes your lungs
Body orifices clenched in your teeth
As you frenziedly try to insert the bungs
Swollen, ripened corpse, the stench of crusting clots
The smell of stale perspiration
Administering watery gore, you're screaming out for more
Addicted to putrefaction
Snort the corpse
Get high on the rot
Orgasmic rush
Turns your brains to pus

See yourself to the exit
We can't afford to watch you resort to this
Even hope hides in the shadows
Nothing is real, color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible
Nothing is real, color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible
You're crashing faster and there won't be
Pieces to piece back together this time
Can't you see you're ringing? You're ringing out
This is dissonance, this is dissonance
It's in the quiet of this place, this is dissonance
That all things come to life, this is dissonance
All that is real is blurred by your notion of reality
All that is real is blurred by your notion of reality
Nothing is real, color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible
Nothing is real, color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible
You skeptic you, you believe in unbelief
You skeptic you, now you're the hypocrite
You can't hide from this, you can't hide from
You can't hide from this, you can't hide from this

Cold in my land
Whate'er the time I've been
Running too fast or walking too slow
For a long time.
Tomorrow I will hate
and celebrate my greed
Wandering the Waste
And tasting my heart
Smells like sour and filth.
Tears don't belong to me
And no one else,
I'm running to my hell
'Cause none of us can make a stand.
Running to my hell...
Cold rain, rush me into my hell,
All alone when light's off.
We are born to procreate
And subjugate.
Tears don't belong to me
And no one else,
I'm running to my hell
'Cause none of us can make a stand.
Running to my hell...
Cold Waste of a bloody
Taste we're alone
And ready to fall.
Frontiers without volunteers.
Who asked for a penny of love?
Skyscrapers with a hellish view from above.
We're ready to fall.
Cold Soul, if you're feeling old you can call
When you can't go on...

Energize me with a simple touch
Or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame
That's burning between us
It's not a fantasy
Another mystery
It's just what I can feel
And something I can see
It's like a memory
And in a melody
It's just what we all know
And we all hear
I was blind
I was closed down
Could not feel
Or set it free
Energize me with a simple touch
Or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame
That's burning between us
It lies in everyone
This swalling energy
It's all around us too
Electrifying you
So can't you set it free?
This virtue is the key
Just something we all know
And we are used
I can feel
It's inside me
Open up
Enlighten me
Energize me with a simple touch
Or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame
That's burning between us
Energize me with a simple smile
Open up your mind
Energize me activate that light
That's given and taken
Can you believe in the power that's burning between us?
Would you believe if you open up your mind
Open up your mind
Energize me with a simple touch
Or with an open heart
Energize me, fire up this flame
That's burning between us
Energize me with a simple smile
Open up your mind
Energize me, fire up this flame
That's burning forever

Come forth!
From the void beyond the stars
From the blackened shores Thee arrive
Thou art ov gods
Yet supreme above them all
Thou art mocked and blessed
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Crowned and conquering child
Cast aside the prophets and false gods ov Thy ways
From the outer space
When TONUAL cross NAGUAL
Beyond becoming, Thou hast become...
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Let me reign as a god among slaves!
Spirit clad in gold
Seraphs incarnate
Shake loose the shackles ov a million years
Shildren ov Seth
Blast wide the portals
Unveil the raptures
Ov Thy kingdom
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Let me reign as a god among slaves!
Io Khepesh!
Io Nubti!
Io Akhakh!

Under her lead
higher than men
hate as a law
a thousand years
away...
You, lady of lies
You, ware my blood
turn it into force
that elevates my strenght
Oh lady of lies
lead me through time
Long is my way
believe (sincere) is my pain
Comes the wise
Comes the strong
but as always
I'm far from
When your sign
will be high
I will follow you
Lady of lies
Under your guide
I dominate
you, Lady of lies
discover my resources
still unknown
Oh lady of lies
lead me through time
Long is my way
believe (sincere) is my pain
Now that is your time
I leave this human being
I'll follow you

It comes from deep within
So swiftly without warning
A place that no one speaks of
Cares not for what&apos;s at stake
The beast tears into walls of the soul
Incessantly
Then breaks loose
Writhing and wretched
It breathes genocide
Upon the fiber of your being
Until nothing remains
Hosting monstrosities
Body becomes a vessel
Controlling every step that&apos;s made
If left undone, true self expires
For all time
May silence keep you always
Pray for the death
That you wrought
Walk with me
Come feel the light once more
Releasing this ghost of ages
Transforming before my very eyes
Reflection not my own
Descending to lifeforms unknown
Evolving within to find a way
To cross the line, staying alive
Release me, be done with me
Become no more

(...of the beast)
You touch my feet without a word
And undress you body slowly
Showing hunger of dead shoulders
To my eyes...
Insatiable of trembling body
Frivolous of a kiss
Disgusting inspired face
And joy from the palms...
You slowly slipped through
My hand
As if everyone could see...
Finally you rise up like carnal
Thrown at the abyss
You're like defenceless dog
Groeles into depth
Where only I paint your eyes...

As the reasons came and went, and swept across
The face of my innocence, I was lost.
To know your face, and your true shade
To feel your lips, and to be bade
To praise the night, to praise my unknown faith
Must I sure find a way? To infest the wound
Inside the wound, that draws me near
And cries my name, and feeds my presence
I am here!
I long for one piece with
I cry for my peace is in you
Inside the wound I hope to find
The essence and presence of you
Inside the wound I wish to learn
The art of fucking you
After the reasons came and went, and swept across
The face of my innocence, I was lost
Inside the wound, that draws me near
And cries my name, and feeds my presence
I am here!
To know your face, and your true shade
To feel the lips, and to be bade
To know your face, and your true shade
To hide in here, in this place
I long for one piece with
I cry for my peace is in you

Memory of the insane
Of killing in so man ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them all
Blood covers the groud, my feet are saturated
Rotting flesh scattered around, I feel no remorse
I don't remember my name
Or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly
Extracting the brains from the skulls
My anger evolves with the more heads I deform
Sawing the neck I am engulfed in fantasy
Chew the esophagus, cannibal delicacy
Utterly execerbated, forver deleterious
Slicing through skin, sundered larynx, veins spraying blood
Tattered windpipe, facial carvings, another head to abhore
Beheading sustains my desire
Enhancing my primitive mind
Annihilation without repreving
Memory of the insane
Of killing in so man ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them at will
Predacious, violent killing spree
Abolished, putrescent cadavers
Butchered in excrement, sordid obscurity
Feverish hunger to inhale the stench of their death

[Chapter one]
Through suffering
My existence is made whole
Upward pure
The strength of character is raised
Thorns that lead to a rose
Eradicate the fences
Improving from failures that weaken my defenses
Wake up
And overcome
Inhale the life
This blood of one
Dust of the earth
Can a man walk through the furnace
Without garments being burned?
[Chapter two ]
Deviate the senses spawned
I see the calm rivers and i`m searching for dawn
My perception overwhelming the herds
Spit them out
Drowning tides that perverse
Opposite from my reaction, the disasters absurd
And the things of no form despise
And the things of no form deprive
Early morning darkness
Splitting veins from the wrist
Who will be the farthest?
Separate the districts
What?
What`s your state of mind?
What`s your state of life?
What`s your take on death?
Do you speak words of the masses?
If so, your throat is bottomless
[Chapter three ]
Observe the turning points that threaten to respond
Defend
Seeds that struggle tom come into fruition
Unripened
This inner being
A consuming fire
That spills from the mouth
A foundation desired
At one with the elements
[Chapter four]
Stable
Ground with no illusions
Streamline
Speech with no pollution
Appealing to the gestures
Altering the momentum with natural selection
[Chapter five]
Feasting on the blemishes congested
Kerosene
Acidic smile perfected
Pours
Phlegm induced pours
Down flow infected
[Chapter seven]
[Chapter eight ]
Running against the tides
Swell
Swallowed whole
Spewing the venom of snakes from their nostrils
Arms that fold
Detestable
Secret practices
False
Doctrines that mold

I'm the family face
Flesh perishes, I live on
Projecting trait and trance.
Through time to times anon
And leaping from place to place
Over oblivion
The years - heired feature that can
In cursive and voice and eye
Despise the human span
Of durance - that is I;
The eternal thing in man
That no call to die.

A scarlet sunset
the threshold to nightplay
A sinful oath is to be sworn
A beckoning bloodlust
among the seekers
Tyrranic hunger yearns
A gathering in flames and fires-
Devil's daughters dance
Scourged in filth, obscene and lewd-
Longing for dark desires
The nocturnal beast appears
in an evil despotic shape
Expectant watching gracelessly
before demanding the sluts of lust
(the Beast)
"Come forth harlots, let's begin!"
(the Beast approaches: )
"Rise and give praise in front of Me
and receive eternal life from Me!
Welcome my spirit in jonour of Me!
So drink of the blood I provide you
and you shall all forever wander in the shadows of death...!
(the chanting whores: )
"Oh yes, Master! Let us receive
Thine offer and drink with Thee!
And become a part of Thy realm
with lust, sex and sodomy-
for we are those who seek life eternally...!
(the Beast: )
"Blood is life and it shall be all ours!"

I summoned up the living dead
And the demons in the skies
I drank from chalice warm and red
And watched the virgined eye
Present at ungodly births
In holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth
And raped the mother of Christ
See'mon baby
Raise your knife
Welcome darling
To my sacrifice
Tie the angel to the altar
Sacrifice to lord in hell
Let the warm blood torrent baby
Moonlight set the night on spell

Sin, sinful, as a sinner I am
Conceived by a jackal
Cunning as a serpent
I'm hiding inside your conscience's parasite
I am the controller
The autocrat of the soul
After me, no turning back
Gaining full soul control
Sin,
As a
Sinner I am
Conceived by a jackal
Cunning as a serpent
I'm hiding
Inside
Need, needle as I am your neediness
Conquering flesh and bones
I'll be
Taking
Over 'till breathing finites
For I am you
I am the controller
The
Autocrat
Of the soul
After me, no turning back
Gaining full soul control
Searching
For thy partner in distress
My endless journey continues
The end is
Ending,
As there is
Nothing more to take
No more than a shadow now
A splinter
Of
What you used to be
I am the controller
The autocrat of the soul
After
Me,
No turning back
Gaining full soul control
Need, needle, as I am your
Neediness
Conquering flesh and bones
I'll be taking over 'till breathing finites
For I am you

She lies in her bed staring into nowhere
Tears running down her face
An open wound bleeding
Her body turns pale
Recalling the road leading away from right
As the dark had appeared as light
Tricked to cross the line, dragged further in
Then trapped in a swirl of wicked lies
Now, no sign of light, no sign of hope
As a dark shadow enters her room
A freezing chill runs down her spine
The smell of death fills the room
The shadow encircles her, pale of fear
Slowly draining the last drops of life
Her last strength she forces through
And cries out to the Lord she used to know
Overwhelming light annihilates the dark
Immediate rest fills her heart
My dear child, come to Me
I will restore you and embrace you with love

She hates the man and he hates the man
Because something strong inside
Has been denied them
But not him, oh, not him
He hates the girl and she hates the girl
Because something weak implied
They fought to push aside them
But not her, oh, not her
The girl isn't alive but the man is dead
Because it's all been said before
The girl isn't alive but the man is dead
Because you only have your mentor to draw your whore
Dead lumps of meat melt in this heat
Dead lumps of meat melt in this heat
She hates the man and he hates the man
Because something strong inside
Has been denied them
But not him, oh, not him
He hates the girl and she hates the girl
Because something weak implied
They fought to push inside them
But not her, oh, not her
This girl isn't alive but the man is dead
Because it's all been said before
The girl isn't alive but the man is dead
Because you only have your mentor to draw from
Dead lumps of meat melt in this heat
Dead lumps of meat melt in this heat but not them
Oh, but not them, oh, but not them
But not them, but not them
Oh, but not them, oh, but not them
But not them, but not them

Hear the lions roar the coloseum serenades
Their mighty growls make you think they didn't eat for a week
Running for your life but once you've caught his eye
then kiss your ass goodbye
You scream in anguish, but the audience favour the lion
Christianity, inferiority, food for the lions in the roman game
Nero's heroes
I bite off your legs
No, no, please God no
I'll grind your crispy bones and I rip your flesh
Our majesty's favourite game and death is the first prize

Open the door and the light washes in. Say what you will, I won't believe it anymore.
Everything's gone, I'm not where I belong,
it's the end of the song ... because I'm free now.
I broke the chain from my neck,
torn away from that which binds.
never will I be the one to believe in nothing...Because I'm free.
(chorus)
Unexcused, unabsolved, I am alone but unafraid.
Undermined, undercut, You can't undo what I have made
Unexplained, unresolved, Is it worth the price I have paid.
Understand.... Ill burn it all.
Risen from ashes my life can begin. Try what you will you can't resist it anymore.
Everythings wrong, misconception is gone, I am where I belong... and I am free now.
I bear the wounds on my back scars untold within my mind. Ever will I be the one who will stop at nothing... to remain free.
(chorus)
Unexcused, unabsolved, I am alone but unafraid. Undermined, undercut, You can't undo what I have made Unexplained, unresolved, Is it worth the price I have paid. Understand.... Ill burn it all.

Never have I been so disgusted,
Never has it all been so clear to me.
Ya
Watch out for pretenders.
No one of any positive reputation
Will respect what you've done.
Judgment will befall your rule,
The wrath will break your law.
Harshness will have His place on this.
You fake, you were meant to fall
Down.
Stop (stop), restart (restart).
Baah watch out for pretenders.
Obtain perspective, re-evaluate your inception.
Endless imitation, obvious
Plagiarism.
I know how you function (I know how you function):
There will be an end to your profit, your possession.
How did it all become, become published?
How can no one see these things?
How can no one see these things?
You fake, you were meant to fall.
How can no one see these things?
You fake, you were meant to fall down.
How can no
How can no one
You fake, you were meant to fall down.
And now the record went gold,
But not an ounce of sincerity was achieved.
I know how you function (I know how you function)
There will be an end to your profit, your possession.
How did it all become, become published?
How can no one see, see these things?
Stop, restart.
Stop, restart.

Far away is the dawn from your eyes, only darkness.
(Only darkness I see in your eyes)
Fearlessly I'm leaning on you in the shadows, in your
World.
And there you find me, my mind is open for your mind.
Meet the night!
Loving your lifeless soul is all too easy.
Still in your lifeless heart there is some beating!
Loving your living soul is just too easy.
The power of love beats death, come and join eternity.
Cold kiss!
Show me how is the world from your eyes 'cause I'm
Envious (Cause I'm envious of your afterlife)
Just one kiss will release me from life - I know you
want it too, I feel you do!
You know I'm longing , you know I want to take you to
Live with the moon!
Loving your lifeless soul is all too easy.
Still in your lifeless heart there is some beating!
Loving your living soul is just too easy.
The power of love beats death, come and join eternity.
Cold kiss!

We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing,
We all know what to do but no one does it,
Now this time has passed and full of regret,
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone,
When they get back, it won't be the same,
never be the same,
My life, you've always been there,
Now you're gone and my heads spinning,
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past,
Moving on your time has run out,
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait,
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends,
As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night,
Never will I forget you, and all the memories past,
So rarely I get to see your face,
Growing I looked to you in guidance.
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me,
To me you were my life,
To me you were my soul companion,
Now you are so far away,
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had,
Come back - to the days when we were young
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered
And I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night
As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

"Ascending through time and space
Oh great cosmos, hand me the key
Contemplating the fabric of your architecture
Oh great all, I see the key you hold
Unreachable for me... now
But I know, I know...
Your eternal ocean of infinite blazing lights
The stillness of your empty motions
Waves of eternity soothes unto my shell
Calming me as I see the reflection of my earthly leave
Entwining me with the continuous structure of time
Knowledge of ages compressed into my state of being
Rising into a higher stream of consciousness
Crowning me into the corestones of "heaven"
Facing me with old, embittered entities
Higher beings, driven insane in the mighty river of eternity
Pitiful creatures, I wash them away... falling down they are
No more tyranny,
No more games,
No more... No more
But despite this freeing of the kingdoms of Dragonland
Emptiness I feel, hollow inside I can't take on the throne alone
The sorrow of my dear still rages in my heart...
I'll end my existence, let me pass unto the other side
Where my bleeding heart will find peace in your loving embrace
Thou art my angel, my only one... together we are the KEY
And thus eternity's saga ends..."

[Verse 1:]
Visions of your love...
Drew me closer, I couldn't get enough
The presence of your hate...
Gave me the dreams, in which I relate
[Chorus:]
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in after to kill
[Verse 2:]
Said that you loved me!
Obviously lying - it's easy
That's all I can take
For you now, your life is at stake
[Chorus 2:]
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in for the kill

Vilely I defile, chastise, humiliate
Writhing, agonized as I violate to impregnate
With lathering soaps and suds I slowly enemize
Innards gurgulate as they're sickly baptised...
Your rectum I will flood
With bleach, detergents and suds...
Rupturing your gallbladder
Liver bleached and soaked
Lungs now flooded
With bicarbonates and boiling soap
Orifices pumped and plugged
Rectal membrane split
Evaporating your bowels
Anal muscle rips...
I grope in the grime, the evacuated motions slush
Pulverising your gut, in my rubber boots and gloves
Your nates purple and raw, brillo pads scour and cleanse
Sticking plasters on abrased organs, to try and make amends...
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase...
Your innards I corrode
This process you will loathe
Your innards I evacuate
With my cruel methods of hate
(Solo: Rectal incubation with intolerable hot enema)
Anal track acidically removed
Along with rotten entrails and stools
Disemboweling in my rage
In your colostomy you suffocate
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase...
Sadistically sodomizing with my instruments of grime
Forcefeeding it down your throat if I find the time
Vaseline and talc soothe the gored ano-obliteration
Sardonically I gloat on your rectal dislocation...
Seething with carnage lust
As the plastic tubing is enthrust...
Rupturing your gallbladder
Liver bleached and soaked
Lungs now flooded
With bicarbonates and boiling soap
Orifices pumped and plugged
Rectal membrane split
Evaporating your bowels
Anal muscle rips...
The anus sucked inside out, my victim now distraught
Rectal tissue I scald, as I boil the inner core
The orifice now clean - sanitised, red and raw
Brutally impaling your rectum, this process I adore...
...Scour...abrase...scrub...erase...
Your innards I corrode
This process you will loathe
Your innards I evacuate
With my cruel methods of hate
Anal track acidically removed
Along with rotten entrails and stools
Disemboweling in my rage
In your colostomy you suffocate

I have a good mind
Take into my head
To start of singing
Began reciting
We seldom get together
And meet each other
On these poor borders
The luckless lands of North
I have a good mind
Take into my head
To start of singing
Began reciting
Those words we've got
From the North's furthest fields
Those words we've got
From the heaths of Kalevala

Heavenly torture
You're burning again
Envy the clueless
That fight 'til the end
Save one that kills one
It's always the same
General scapegoat
No one is to blame
You want to help
And to learn
But it's hard
When they turn
And everybody want
To see you burn
Business and pleasure
Curse your ways
You represent everything
Wrong with the world today
You are the bullet
In the gun
The one that took
The only son
You want what's good
For the country
You want the
Heathens to learn
You have the best
Of intentions
But how quickly they turn
Now everybody want to
See you burn
Kill you with a smile
Always id denial
Kill you with a smile
Save you for a while
Save one that kills one
it's always the same
Your ways to disgust me
And it's just a game
Can you believe
We're all the ones that won
We won't miss it
Until it's gone
We will never learn
Now it is your turn
Everybody want to
See you burn
Everybody want to see you burn
Everybody want to see
Your public burning
Public burning
No returning now

As I pet and fondle animals, I get arosed sexually
Feeling with the deepest desires to indulge in bestiality
Whether it was dogs, cattle, sheep or horse
Animals are raped easily, they cannot scream for help
Though they must be restrained as they kick, bite and yelp
Erotic zoophilism, a sexual abnormality
A behavior disorder that's controlling me
With women I'm stuck with complete impotence
I've found the best piece of ass walks on four legs
The kind you can ride, herd or rolls over and begs
I must muzzle a dog to prevent a serious bite
Rear limbs spread and tied, I fuck a canine tonight
As I orgasm inside, thoughts cause me to wonder
I imagine a litter of man-pups suckling the bitch mother
Sexually stimulated at the sight of fur
My erotic preferences shall disgust for sure
For lesser creatures I am lust crazed
My finest fucks in the pasture laid
With livestock of all kinds I've had intercourse
Only with animals I wish to have sex
Erotic zoophilism, a sexual abnormality
A behavior disorder that's controlling me
With women I'm struck with complete impotence
I've found the best piece of ass walks on four legs
The kind you can ride, herd or rolls over and begs
I must muzzle a dog to prevent a serious bite
Rear limbs spread and tied, I fuck a canine tonight
As I orgasm inside, thoughts cause me to wonder...
Deep in my being, I tap my primal core
Plunging into the worst form of impiety
As I betroth in sacrilegious unions
With the most feral zoological breeds
My most primitive instincts take controls
Excited by various wild and barnyard scents
Into a bovine rump I will soon trespass
Relinquishing human milt beneath a quadruped tail
Animalia in heat ignites unwholesome desire
Coitus with certain species quenches the fire
Slipping into the vaginal gape of a mammalian mate
Hybrid horrors created, if I inseminate
Domesticated and wild brutes sickenly laid
Pregnancies prevented with the beasts are spayed
Erotic zoophilism, a sexual abnormality
A behavior disorder that's controlling me
With women I'm struck with complete impotence
I've found the best piece of ass walks on four legs
The kind you can ride, herd or rolls over and begs
I must muzzle a dog to prevent a serious bite
Rear limbs spread and tied, I fuck a canine tonight
As I orgasm inside, thoughts cause me to wonder...

No more heart broken songs, get over it, move on
Let's wipe those tears away from that pretty face
That pretty fucking face
No more crying to your dashboard records, you sappy emo bitch
We are all born alone and we all die alone
Forget about your problems just for one night
No more crying, only death and dying
Let's wipe those tears away
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
You're not the only one, everyone has their problems
So put a smile on that pretty fucking face
And look ahead to the future
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone

Have you heard the story?
Have you heard the news?
They say he's coming
You better choose
Visual horror
On the TV screen
Nothing but madness
Ever seen.
I am the beast, evil I will install.
I shall ignite the fire, burn you all!
Enter my blackened kingdom, you'll serve me well.
Turn it up, maximum Satan, straight to hell!
Politicians stealing
Disappearing kids.
Crimes and blackmail
For the winning bids.
Crimes of passion
And crimes of hate.
Buy the new drug
Before it's too late!
I am the beast, evil I will install.
I shall ignite the fire, burn you all!
Enter my blackened kingdom, you'll serve me well.
Turn it up, maximum Satan, straight to hell!
How can you believe this?
The world is like TV!
I'm the supplier
With only negativity!
I am not real
I'm just imagination!
I bleed on the mirror of
Human devastation!
One by one I'll take you down
One by one I'll take you down
One by one I'll take you down
One by one I'll take you down
Natural disaster
You better fear
The end is coming
The end is here
I am the beast, evil I will install.
I shall ignite the fire, burn you all!
Enter my blackened kingdom, you'll serve me well.
Turn it up, maximum Satan, going straight to hell!

[MAGNUS:]
I taste the wrath of your might
[THORSEN:]
I humble before thee dear father above
[MAGNUS:]
So bring down your hammer this night
[THORSEN:]
Your thunder and lightning shall rain from the sky
Will I forgive you brother
Will you fight by my side
Blood reigns in Valhalla
To the battlefield we ride
Blood! Fire!
And the dead will ride the wings
Of the Valkyries
[MAGNUS:]
The dark clan of giants descend
[THORSEN:]
The thirst for revenge burns like fire in our veins
[MAGNUS:]
So fight by my side to the end
[THORSEN:]
With broadswords and axes let the carnage begin
[THORSEN:]
I swear by the hand of Odin
And the blood of my first born son
[MAGNUS:]
I'll cast away my indignities
And stand by the chosen ones
Honor and duty - a code to guide my way
[THORSEN:]
When the battle is over, the dead will raise again
On the wings of Valkyries
[THORSEN:]
How does it feel when you're cut down
And you can't get back up
When you're down and you need a hand
Someone to give you strength
There's just one thing that will do it
Don't let 'em take it away
It's the calling to battle
And you will ride the wings, yeah
Blood! Fire!
And the dead will ride the
Wings of honor
And the gods will lead our
Charge to glory
On that day for every man
Who rides

Baphomet leads unholy lust In darkness
I only fuck Through eternal
searching for the true corpse of my lust
Black Mass and fornications near the searing lake of fire Unholy might doth bring Blasphemous Alterations
[chorus]

Crawl in awful stealth to me
Forever a voyeur I've been
Nocturnal Goddess of the Moon
So she comes, unseen
Thus (Uzza and Azel) speak
The burning seed, is thrust in Eve
and yearning keeps me, captive of desire
Make me as a flower that grows
forever in your throne
that I might pollinate the world
with darkness as your own
Embrace me in spellbinding eyes
the fire of life that never dies
tear deeper through my paper wounds
and never leave inside
Love shall consume and bathe the Lady
whom I worship and ride therefore
She will greet me as a serpent
in her dark, secret Eden
and I will always want
for her witchcraft is
Desire... (Desire...)
My soul is poisoned from within...
I crawl with languid guilt to thee
forever flushed in sin
Lamia, latria I give
my soul is poisoned from within
Wisdom breeds, fecundity
and her cunt she feeds, to fulfill her desire
To Eve I cum...
Sevenfold my passion wrought
To ransack Eden, and to taste the whore
I cling beyond her sabled court
She is a gateway, to that darkness lost
(Now dream...)
Oh, the fevered need for Her
when greed and lust are sharpened in that one desire
that all-consuming fire
Reveal to me your mysteries, Witch
the tree is plundered but I have the see
to be sown in thee
"Mon sortilege a ete le pouvoir qui diovent
avoir les ames fortes sur les espirits faibles"
Leonora Galigai

Liar save me your speach
Liar save me your speach
You are perfect for me
There is no excuse for your repulsiveness
They say its all in my head
That I must realize it's a figure of speach
But I'm curious to find out myself
Beauty comes from within
Let's see if that is true
Too late for regrets
Now that you're open wide
Why punish punish me
Guess that I was wrong
That was no pretty sight
But I'll try again until I find mrs. right
Thay say its all in my head
That I must realize it's a figure of speach
But I'm curious to find out myself
Beauty comes from within
Now I know that is so
This little unborn life is truly adorable
Why punish me I had to know
What is right
What is wrong
This proof I found
It say it all

In the break of the morning,
Coming in with no warning,
Striking from the high
Like the size of a city,
Comes this mountain of stone
From a different sky
There was a torturous vision of a deadly collision,
We watched in agony
An inconceivable terror, a celestial invader,
Innocent casualties
Burning fire, screams of pain and fear
Piercing higher, hell on earth is here
Man-kind is melting, life just drains away
Darkness, death, this the blackest day
Obliteration, disintegration,
It's all turning to dust
From the force of the impact,
Humanity beginning to rust
The world begins to crumble,
It's all just a matter of time
This is the untimate chaos,
This is the end of the line
In the break of the morning,
Striking from up high
This is the ultimate chaos, this is the end

To the fucker who let me have a life in the dark,
Till the day my life ran out
Well a day in the dark, a bloody lust of wind, wanna know what it's about?
It's not like your gonna need me or I'm gonna miss you
when the worlds so cold out there
So dumb, what the fuck am I doing here?
All I need to know
I'm sorry and ill let you go by the reign you built for me
Still a god but, don't wanna even know what's waiting for me
I'll be waiting here for always
Wanna go? Yeah, hang that rope
Every thought breaks down in my head
Best to run, blinded soul
Bring me back on my feet and let me go I'm fine alone
In this shell of life you left me hanging dry
With a smile on my face I'll watch you cry
Forms of my dream
Down you'll be grime
I'll be waiting here for always
Wanna go? Yeah, hang that rope
Every thought breaks down in my head
Best to run, blinded soul
Bring me back on my feet and let me go I'm fine alone
In this shell of life you left me hanging dry
With a smile on my face I'll watch you cry
Watch you cry
Watch you cry

Is that a strain
Or a delicate smile
Built to proportion?
It might as well have been you
And all the things you do
Somedays
I'm waiting
For my pulse to calm down
Into the low hundreds
I shake the shirt loose off my back
Day and night, year in year out
I discovered my sweet dreams
Of corruption deep inside myself
I should have stood in carny
Or end up preserved upon your shelf
Day and night, year in year out
Will you ever understand
That I'm only an object
Day and night year in year out
I'm just trying to be the subject
Where others see the abstract
I only see the truth
And that has always been
To repeat my youth

And I watch how your big words
Return with an echo of emptiness
Inside your walls of fear
Feeding the insecurity
And I watch as your soul
Swallow the blackest lie
Resurrection rejected
Denial of afterlife
Symptoms of a blind man
To comprehend the insanity
Of this grand illusion
Is unbearable
The spirit that fears the Blood
Can never bring truth
Fallen with the snake
Never to rule

I will always feel and I will always care.
I wish she was my enemy but I'm still waiting
Here for her to hold my hand.
For her to steal my breath.
For her to pick up the pieces of promises never kept.
She moves in slow motion
Sonically as the rain.
As the rain falls down.
Everything is still as she moves to me.
Stands still.
Maybe I'll do better on my own.
Why does everything disappear?
When all I see is you alone
And her love moves slowly
This time now I'm dying for you to call my name.
I'm waiting.
Still fading.
So tell me I am not alone.
I'm still waiting.
I'm still fighting.
Wake me from this sleep,
So I can begin living,
Or give me the solution,
So I can start dying.
Will I start living, or start dying?
Maybe I'll do better on my own.
Why does everything disappear?
When all I see is you alone
And her love moves slowly
This time now I'm dying for you to call my name.
I'm waiting still fading.
So tell me I am not alone.

with a hose
no one will ever find you
The smell of your carrion hangs low in the street
weeks of returning to relax in the meat
Butchery/morgue meets day-spa retreat
The smell of the carnage
begin the excretement
Choice picked tidbits of ligaments
I mix for an afternoon sludge soup
constantly craving, needing to eat shit
No escape from this place
life condemned to rot
pulpy ulcerous filaments
gagged snot and clots

... he looked upon the world
and saw that it was still depraved
as him
though not like him
for him, as all
but closed
like them
not him
unaware
he was
already caught within
their cycle
with them
outside
depraved
instinctive
rebellion
possessed
by bestial despair
he fought
this law
and broke
the spell
"So, this is why I built my empire
fled from the truths unto which they conspire"
in spirit born a stranger
a counterpart in mind
the seeker raised to bury
a freak among the blind
encountered with mysteries
on his mission to reverse their ways
he sought a life among the dead
with refuge in an endless maze
...before the silence...
"This can not be the purpose of my presence.
What then is the call of my return?"

Wars in the night
Fear in my eyes
And fighting with all the warriors
Keeping all the treasures
Hiding the reasons
And watching (the) warriors falling down
I would like to be a bird
I would like to be a man
When the fire runs withe me
I will feel free again
[chorus]
Born in the dark
Fighting with us
There is no reason to let you down
Come with us now
It's cold at dawn
There is no reason
Born in the dark
Power in my hands
Fear in my veins
And calling my brothers right now
Fighting with corpses
There is no return
And moving mountains with faith
I can see the light on me
I can see my destiny
When the fire runs with me
I will feel free again
[chorus]

...Aborted gestation...foetal mutilation...
...Abortive secretions..embryonic fermentation...
Your crotch spawning afterbirth
A congealing sprog basted in cess
Palpitations spew a foetus
Sprawling in this mess...
Flowing lochial discharge
Of copious womb lining torn
The mutilated still-born mangled
By the whiplashing umbilical cord...
Mixing together post-natal juices
The dead infant used as stock
Slurping this horrendous concoction
Eat the cervical slop...
Ladling out aborted debris
Oozing guts chomped in your maw
The caesating premature baby
Nurtured in post-partum gore...
Suck cess on a plate, lick its pus from a spoon
Gnaw at rashes on a dish, munch on the expelled womb...
Its testicles incised - the foetus liquidized
Whisk the parasite - the gross remains baptized...
(Solo: parturient paste sandwich)
Stagnant placenta and smelly fluids
The stiffening dead babe's crib
Disemboweling and gutting
Grating bone and rib
Fragile limbs puverized
Dismemberment is so cruel
Soggy organs and paturient broth
Give piquance to this sickly gruel...
Mixing together post-natal juices
The dead infant used as stock
Slurping this horrendous concoction
Eat the cervical slop...
Ladling out aborted debris
Oozing guts chomped in your maw
This ceasating premature baby
Nurtured in post-partum gore...
Drink bile from a cup, gulp its phlegm from a pot
Eat mucus on a saucer, choke on the embryonic clots...
(Solo:Pasteurized foetus goulash)

LOTUS!
[Violent j]
Like a fuckin fantastic solar eclipse or comets passing
The lotus is in bloom stopping time never ever lasting
Like a velvet red sunset a cloud formation it takes away your breath
Your frozen in the moment till nothings left much like a northern light show
Tornadoes ripping through a vacant land
There's a lotus in the sand
Pluck it, hold it in your hand
Lotus is forever and when it whilts away its eternal root are deep (deep) forever here to stay
[Monoxide]
I'm all alone again no one to talk to
Nobody wanna be the friend that i want to
I thought you could come through and help but instead you just left me to wither in hell
Now how can i tell the rest that I'm leaving and the cause of death is the season
I change up and i wither away resurrect in the moon when the sun turns grey
When i watch em all turn away there's not a thing i can do except watch it all change
I can listen to the trees speak to the wheat leaves as they fall like soldiers in war
As they form a pile right in from of my eyes
All praise to god for these other four
[Chorus x2]
We rejuvenate we again resurrect
We revitalize and we keep coming back
And they say where did it go to?
(where did it go)
And they say where did it go to?
(where did it go)
[Shaggy]
Once again its last curtain call no need to fight it (no need to fight it)
The scripture of the brother hood opaque have all been recited
My pollination will float through the air and keep carrying on (carrying on)
The moon shines this light on us for that i thank god
Now we out with an unquenchable bottomless thist
We goin out in a blaze of glory so call up the hurse
You can pick off all the leafs but yet the roots still remain again with so much to gain flourishing in the black rain
[Blaze]
This is the end of all things,
Reign of all kings
Sun burnt out from within the winter wind
Loss of the sun and the time that it brings
Years pass out without any meaning
Most stay sheltered and hide out from the cold
Lyrics frozen to the ground as the wind blows
Lotus wilts away and it regrows
Those who we chose adhere to the cold
Could never be told and never be sold
Tales of the history lies of the old
We will never be lost and never be gone
Written in the stones of the never-after mold
Our existence is withering to regenerate, reincarnate, its only fate they cant hate
But rejoice with the voice of the new world we decide to create...
Dark Lotus.
Time waits for nobodyalways ticking, moving on [x2]
Dark Lotus
Where did it go to?
Where did it go?
And they say,
Where did it go to?
Where did it go?
Dark Lotus
Time waits for nobodyalways ticking, moving on [x2]
Dark Lotus
Where did it go to?
Where did it go?
And they say,
Where did it go to?
Where did it go?
[Madrox]
Everything they live, then they die, who am I
Just anotha muthafucka has or not,
How did it slip by so quickly?
Lotus is in the Water, so many to chose
And He decided to pick me?
Im amazed as Im withered and I spend my last days
Once was in bloom, my petals faded away
One by one, try ta get em to stay
Till the outcome became deflowered and decayed
Now I need to regenerate, everything to die
Fittin to live every second in life, its like a gift
Imma take it in the present and spend it the right way
Imma put it to a song they gon sing and play
And when they hear it, hopefully they spiritll listen
And they wont spend all of they life just wishin
Stop, and restartforgive, never forget
And never live any life buried in regret

You'll be running out of miracles
Like I'm running out of dreams
Madness lurking to my left
Angels faint in front of me
And I see eyes to the right
I hear a promise resound
Gold and diamonds, love and fame
And music meant to remain
You've been dying for glory
You've looking for love
Why don't we read the signs
When we're about to get lost
A seeker enthralled by a flame
Eventually home to his pain
The Great Unbeloved
You reach for the final stage
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in a tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world is in the way
Way down to the hideaway
Afflatus Divine! Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
lock up the rain for a wicked symphony
Don't you give up on your emotions
Don't you abandon your despair
If you deny what you desire
This would been just a mystery play
There'll be nowhere to go
Just oblivion, we're so close to reach out
Close to fall, make up or break up or crawl
You're striving for beauty
For a song to remain
A final touch and the spirit you have cited
Hold on to the reins
I feel how I'm losing my ground
A dancer enthralled by a sound
The smoke clears away
I'll reach for the final stage
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in a tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world is in the way
Way down to the hideaway
Afflatus Divine! Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
lock up the rain for a wicked symphony
Oh I can hear it, I can hear it
Oh I can hear it, I, I, I, I...
I can hear it, yeah
I'm dying for a sign
You can turn your face away
Can pretend you don't hear it
How long have you been begging on your knees
And now that you're near it
Won't you be damned if you defy what you're given
Mercury of salvation
The colors for the eyes of the world
We'll be kings for generations
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in a tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world is in the way
Way down to the hideaway
Afflatus Divine! Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

Enter the realm of chaos, your nightmare has just begun
You may wake up screaming, but there's no place left to run
The ancient prophecy of dominant supremacy
Find strength through your salvation, the need for domination
Past life you deplore, present life abhor
Future life is so unreal, intense despair now you feel
Mutated creature round you stare, at your limbs they all tear
It's too late now to say a prayer, for your gods have no care
Welcome incursions of chaos, you know you cannot resist
To serve, worship, obey them - Is the only way to exist
Your foretold destiny of perpetual lunacy
The final requisition, is no longer your decision
The obscure depravity blinds you, now you cannot see
What they've made of your world as your blood is turning cold
Now it's time to pay your price - The ultimate sacrifice
Gasp at your final breath - Cleansed now in your death
Your death

Life, an abandoned wreck
In motion, driven into circles
Never ending circles
Nothing new has taken place
Seems like this place will never change
Just a mercy child
In a blood red cover
Just a mercy child
Covered in truth
A roller coaster of feelings
Steering whatever thought and action
Into a pattern
A pattern repeated
Remove the veils
The glory seems weak
The heart needs the light
Of your glorious presence
Regain control
Of this powerless wreck
Let it complete the course of life

Northwards and netherwards
Where towered a dreary palace
She, the ruler of misty Hel ere waiting for you in the hall of death
Hoartfrosted sick-bed hordes trudge
Murderers and oathbreakers
On a crowded path of death yes, to Hel comes the most.
Betrayed be her father, her mother be distress
Mournful beauty, her face half black, half flesh
Tears of sorrow falls like pearls onto the ground
Odin: Send her far away and let her evil do no harm
Send her to Niflhel, to theuttermost peak
Her blood can never in this hall of honour reek
Far Far North
North of Ginnunngagap
Where she rules supreme
In lonely majesty
Soak shall be her home
In death's eternal winter she alone
Welcome to her frosty home
Far Far North
On the ness I now stand
Oh, death would be so sweet
But my fate was rusty sealed
My vengance comes wrapped in sleet
My powers but grow and grow
Come to me, come to me
Ragnarokkr I shall sow
When all chains break I'll be free
Children red with weeping and a howling bloodsmeared hound
Wrapped in Bedridden saved a place for the weak
Across the burning bridge and through the gate of Hel
Horrid visions the prophetess saw from where the dead from Hel decend
Many men entombed in frost in the ninth realm
Into the deepest pit she saw
A hall she saw stand
far from the sun
It's doors facing north
on Corpse Strand
Drops of poison
dripped through the smoke-hole;
The hall wattled
with serpents backs
She saw there wading
through tubulent waters
Men forsworn
and murderers

All along it was me who changed.
Morning now waits for me.
What I have to gain does not matter
If what I give is all to You.
I have seen the stars full
And the sun rise again,
But You are yet to change.
You are all that is worth living for.

For the cold pale women
I leave some of my goodness
I leave the veil of sin
And let go my dreams
Eternity follows me everywhere
Your words so hollow won't go anywhere
Distant shadows disappears
It searches the gate beyond the stars
And there I can see her again
Tell me why
You have to be so pure and wrong
And I'm alive to be here
Tell me why
You have to be so pure and wrong
And I'm alive to be here
Is it just an omen?
Is it me walking blindly?
I will find the answer
When I wake up from my dream
Eternity follows me everywhere
Your words so hollow won't go anywhere
Distant shadows disappears
It searches the gate beyond the stars
And there I can kill her again
Tell me why
You have to be so pure and wrong
And I'm alive to be here
Tell me why
You have to be so pure and wrong
And I'm alive to be here

Simply slide in my sheets
and simply fall asleep
should she shatter my heart
ans scatter these parts
among the shaded streets
in a shallow attempt
to save her skin
then I simply wasn't shooting for the stars
and tell me again
are you the reason I breathe
or why I die trying
and i reckon this weapon I yield
this is her reason for revenge
her chance to write the words I wrote
her chance to take this from me
trust I will find my way out
i'll cut the throat to my better half
and you could choose what you'd rather have
could my concern kill
a car crash in her body as she swallows each pill
kill her with kindness
count on clouds
to slow her down
and I reckon this weapon I yield
this is her reason for revenge
her chance to write the words I wrote
her chance to take this from me
trust I will find my way out
i'll cut the throat to my better half
and you could choose what you'd rather have
limp and lifeless my body without its frame
scream my name three times if you love me
it's the only way to save me
crows can't fly with comets girl
don't get caught in the current

Awaken from the bliss of sleep
The daybreak haunts you in such a subtle light
I hear them, they tell me these roads we have travelled fork up beyond the bend
Beneath the flutter of desperate wings they sing a song of reclamation
Where tomorrow's hanging horizon interrupts the hum of electrical towers
Here - there are the shallow graves
The shallower romances
And the shallowest of words still to be spoken
And there you are with open ears
Locust reign on your parade

You're what i wanted.
But what wanted me?
Money speaks louder than my dreams.
Normal life was something I'd seen as tragedy.
The future is never what it seems.
Common life has come so easily.
Money adds so much to normalcy.
Better years turned bitter.
Why can't I do what's right for me?
Turning the page means burning the versus
of the ones I wrote this with.
Certainty has come at such a high price
but it's the price I pay for peace of mind
but do I mind the peace that comes along and all things aside,
understand these are my dreams
we lived them together for a moment in time.
Is this the beginning of the end?
Or the end of the beginning?
Watch it fade away.
Watching this thing change.
Common life has come so easily.
Money adds so much to normalcy.
Better years turned bitter.
Why can't I do what's right for me?

The night-wind swallows you
Eats you up in lust and smiles, silently
Sleep, sleep, sweetheart
Dream and forget our misery
A mortal fever haunts the dying earth
Our hearts and souls stand still and wince
I can't save your day,
Rescue won't take your hand,
So sleep the day away
Sleep, my dear
And our god hides in calm
I whisper while your eyes are shut
And don't see this hell on earth
Sleep, sleep sweetheart, never wake up
You are not made for this world's grinning pain
Shining eyes, they are no more, sleep well
Veins getting cold and the shadows lurk, shadows lurk
I long for new born lights divine and pure
A clearing rain to wash our dirt away
A mortal fever haunts the dying earth
Our hearts and souls stand still and wince
Content dance the snakes
For their work now's completed
Their poison creeps
I whisper while your cheeks turn cold and silence grabs your breath

And in the end I'll rise
Endured the event that should have been my demise
Looking forward to new life, my second chance
In a candid instance I witness life flash before my eyes
My sense of purpose is encouraged by my will to survive
Looking past that day toward my future.
What will it be? Knowing what must be done.
And it shows my seams are frayed,
Give me the strength,
Strength to face the day.
My soul has been engraved, give me
The strength, strength to make this change

Don't know why I feel
This way every night
Somehow lost my way
On this timeless flight All these feelings I keep locked up inside
I've pulled and twisted all those strings
And tried to mend these broken wings
Still inside the night I fly on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Watching in silence
Watching in silence again
Keep pushing on
I keep pushing on
Watching in silence
Inside the night as
All of the world
Is asleep
See me as I fly
So high in the night
All these feelings surround
This new gift of life
With these wings I'll fly
So high in the sky
I'll watch the world
As it goes down
It's buildings crumbled to the ground
The panic-ridden streets
Will cry on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Watching in silence
Watching in silence again
Keep pushing on
I keep pushing on
Watching in silence
Inside the night as
All of the world
Is asleep
You're feeling free
Apart from reality
All you do is run away
I'm falling from a hole in the sky
Once again don't know if I'll survive
Every second falling closer to the end
Broken wings of destiny
Spiral down again
You can feel the wind
Against your face
You cannot move
You're caught in place
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Watching in silence
Watching in silence again
Keep pushing on
I keep pushing on
Watching in silence
Inside the night as
All of the world
Is asleep

These eyes I see don't even remind me of me.
I want to put the knife in and make you dirty on the inside.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
Beg for me.
My fate rests in the arms of hell.
I bought the dead and now they've come to collect.
By darkness enslaved with the heart strings of sorrow.
I sold my soul and solemn darkness fills the hole.
Part of me sleeps and part of me dreams.
A mouth full of rumors hands full of daggers in a room full of mirrors no god, no savior.
My own indifference is what separates me from the pain.
Razor blade victims breaking the skin just to pour the hate back in.
Just to pour the hate back in.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees, beg for me.
Beg for me.
These eyes I see don't even remind me of me.
I want to put the knife in and make you dirty on the inside.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
Beg for me.
Pushing the needle through the stitching has began to wear.
Only I can tell you when this sickness will end.
My fate rests in the arms of hell.
I bought the dead and now they've come to collect.
By darkness enslaved with the heart strings of sorrow.
I sold my soul and solemn darkness fills the hole.
Part of me sleeps and part of me dreams.
A mouth full of rumors hands full of daggers in a room full of mirrors no god, no savior.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees, beg for me.

Are we beyond salvation?
Can't read the runes, can't see
Got lost in the translation
Why, why, why did we?
We're squaring the circle by powers unseen
Undreamt of till we're in between
Reality fades, your mind in cascades
A soul-stirring journey to free
(Our souls from the boundary)
Unconfined
We are to see behind
Out of this world afar
We arrived my friend
A straw in the wind revealed
We're further afield, all we can dream
Where no one has gone before
Where am I? A vermillion sky
To my naked eye
It's the eleventh hour
It is no mystery
All by sheer will power
Where, where, where are we ?
The whys and wherefores, outlandish they are
The alpha and the omega, wheels within wheels
Nobody feels although of sound mind we are
(Over the odds afar)
Unconfined
We are to see behind
Out of this world afar
We arrived my friend
A straw in the wind revealed
We're further afield, all we can dream
Where no one has gone before
Where am I? A vermillion sky
To my naked eye
A trick of the light
A trail-blazing journey astray
The back of beyond
This could be our way
Unconfined
We are to see behind
Out of this world afar
We arrived my friend
A straw in the wind revealed
We're further afield, all we can dream
Where no one has gone before
Where am I? A vermillion sky
To my naked eye

One by one, the fools suck you in
Like many others before
No guilty conscience, just another sin
They're truly rotten to the core
Contracts with criminal intent
Spelling out the things they're gonna do
Liars, taking back their word
Draining the life right out of you
Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade
Paid for the service, signed the dotted line
But then get nothing in return
Result, I'm sinking, running out of time
Response, it's none of my concern
When you're exposed
The first reaction, defend it with another lie
Attempted character assassination
You cannot kill me but you try
Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade, go
The clowns on parade
Oh, yeah
Payback is mine
You tried to make a mockery
It's payback time
A failed attempt to bring an end to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two faced, these sad little people
Enjoy the spotlight while you can
Disrespecting, those who you deceive
You're just a flash in the pan
Evil, to take you for a ride
Then try to damage all you've got
Pure scum and headed for a fall
Karma will catch up and then you'll rot
Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade
Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade
The clowns on parade

Water travels by itself
Inspires us to fear the sea
When it affects our state of mind
We drown in our make-believe
Those little drops that cover two thirds
Eventually there will be nothing left
But water, this water
It rules but even so
It tears apart around us
throws itself high up in the sky
Never will be able to tame

[Violent J:]
A black sand storm is approaching the metropolis
Sucking up sunlight it moves ontop of us
Beaches of black sand are littered with dead fish
Black sand deserts grow blood red cactus
Dust devils twist human bodies in half
Black sands down the hourglass that's our ass
This ain't the past that we live in we're not forgiven
It's death at the hands of the lands we've been given
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
A murdering sense feel the essence of the black sand
The sight alone cause trauma to a mortal man
Smoke starts rising and images appear
My legs stick and death replays over in the mirror
Grades of black sand the coming of your end
All you ever loved is now appearin wasteland
Lost forever and still you will descend
You're caught between light and dark within the black sand
[Chorus:]
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Follows whipping by, it surrounds you
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Follows whipping by, it surrounds you
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
[Jamie Madrox:]
In the black sand I draw a diagram
A mythical imaginary wondrous land
Where pharaohs once inhabited and pyramids avast
Till the sky ate the sun turning everything to black
Night was eternal no more shadow of the Sphinx
Robbed the sun God and became extinct
May as well have died and turned to dust
Till the lightning hit the pyramids and everyone was crushed
[Monoxide Child:]
Black sand mortal's end
Time for the Lotus to claim reign again
Cross legged I sit surrounded
Cops around it who block the worlds end
Shots fired at my direction
But I'm protected by the black sands within
Now watch me disappear in the air so thin
As I now being the end of humans
[Chorus:]
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Follows whipping by, it surrounds you
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Follows whipping by, it surrounds you
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
In your face black sand thrown
Then my knife rips you open from your balls to your dome
Lots roots planted deep down in this shit
When the pedals bloom that's when wigs get flipped
A world where the darkness consuming your soul
Sand leaking out your ass, nose, eyes and ear holes
Now you on your knees praying for your life
Too bad for your bitch ass you just another sacrifice
[Chorus:]
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Follows whipping by, it surrounds you
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Black sand blowing in the sky
Close your eyes
Follows whipping by, it surrounds you
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Close your eyes
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Close your eyes
Don't look or you'll turn to stone
Voices drive my conscience, and I fight. To keep them sane...

It's love of the dead
Arising from her sleep
To the sweet smell of decay
Lying in a coffin
Dead flesh she craves
There's kissing, of course, caressing,
Blood drinking, the smell, the attraction
Morbid lust must be satisfied
In the shadows she must hide
Entering the sacred tomb
To fuck those who have died
When you lie on some bodies, blood comes out of their mouth, and the weight
of my body pushes it out. That's called purging
Kissing the flesh
So dead and cold
Purging blood
To drink and be whole
Strength from the dead
To feed the soul
I definitely enjoy swallowing blood. It's very arousing making love with a
body and drinking some of the blood
Robbing the grave
There's a difference between fucking and making love.
Maybe some people fuck dead bodies. I make love to them
Screaming in agony
Coming on the corpse
Takes it home in the hearse
So she can get some more
When I enjoy myself with a corpse, it's a high beyond any I've ever had

You're the filthy creature
Crouched in the shadows
Of a street light
Hunched over your catch
Shit, she's barely alive
Blood dried up and caked in her hair
Her face just a bloody mess
Just when you think you're gonna
Finish the job
Martha comes along
Just to set things straight.
Gaping mouth
Full of razor-sharp teeth
All seeing eyes
She's staring you down.
She shatters your skull
In her vice-like grip
She tears your head off
Your victim gets sick
Lucky for you she wasn't dead
You just lost your head
Your brains oozing out
From between her fingers
Your blood wets her lips.
Grinning like an undertaker
Ready to dress a corpse
Grinning like an undertaker
Ready to dress a corpse

Scathing attacks of time and torment
When we Sleep walk our lives away
these thieves
They've made
Our hearts break
So now I'm screaming
Attacks of heartless horror
At them their cash cant kill us all and
We have built we have, we have
built upon their dream to long
Don't be their fucking slaves
We live in exploitation We have worked
blind endless means
they have turned our failure into what they need
So Break these shackles and take a stand we are the gears
we are the ones they fear
take their crowns away
They wont take away my life, a slave no longer in my mind I
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world
The revolt returns
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world
GET UP
We live in exploitation We have worked blind endless means
they have turned our failure into what they need
TAKE IT BACK

I was away for a while
But I'm hoping someday you'll forgive me
Though I don't deserve it
I'll cherish it well if you give me one of your new starts
Just one more last chance
I swear that I'll earn it
If you front me for now
I'm good for it I swear
I'm better now I swear
In earlier days, they'd persecute people
They'd carry them off, and hobble their legs
For lesser offenses, and how I have harmed you
And still you allow me to walk free of pain
Though I punish myself
I will never settle
The debts I've incured for scorning the face
Of absolute beauty, and measureless grace
And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now
I'm dying to pay for it now
So hand me the rocks to help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound
To the end of an anchor thrown into the sound
And test me to see if I will rise against the worst that it can get
I wasn't well for a while
I savored the things that I knew were sure to destroy me
And that seemed to hold me
That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go
On the strength of my own
Well, I should've known
That gets me nowhere
I've learned that now I swear
In earlier days, they'd persecute people
They'd carry them off, and hobble their legs
For lesser offenses, and how I have harmed you
And still you allow me to walk free of pain
Though I punish myself
I will never settle
The debts I've incured for scorning the face
Of absolute beauty, and measureless grace
And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now
I'm dying to pay for it now, now, now
So hand me the rocks to help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound
To then end of an anchor thrown into the sound
And test me to see if I will rise against the worst that it can get
Well, I wasn't sure that I could
Well, I wasn't sure that I could
Well, I wasn't sure that I could
But, I can

deeper within the sorrow grows
buried in me are the seeds I've sown
I've given to you all I have to give
and you turned me away
feed... and I'm sober
feed... and I'm colder
feed... and I'm older
and I'm older
and I'm older
and I am blessed within
free from all my sins
and I am blessed within
free from all my sins
feed... and I'm sober
feed... and I'm colder
feed... and I'm older
and I'm older
and I'm older
the coldness of life that you now feel
is the open sore that makes me real
I have bled for you and you bleed me dry
and then you threw me away
feed... and I'm sober
feed... and I'm colder
feed... and I'm older
and I'm older
and I'm older
and I am blessed within
free from all my sins
and I am blessed within
free from all my sins
feed... and I'm sober
feed... and I'm colder
feed... and I'm older
and I'm older
and I'm older

one night we stole the sky
the moon was bright, our sorrow pale
one night we left behind
the moralized, the sons of Cain
one night we sold the sky
the son of light, the enemy
one night to testify
2nd sight, the mirror-play
one night we buried the sky
for our God, for the devil and hate
one night we rose a smile
for a life inside a cage
no word can describe all my fright
no colour my pain
defy them
stir the fire
bright as no starlight could rain
one night we kissed goodbye
the merry child, the feverdream
one night to play divine
to cut the wings of Seraphim
one night we coloured the sky
white for God, black for hell and our names
one night as if paralyzed
put our love inside a cage
no word can describe all my fright
no colour my pain
defy them
stir the fire
bright as no starlight could raini

Illuminating is what we are
When we will be on the stars
I will feel great
Without my weight
that I would feel
while on the ground
Who would have thought
that we could overcome
such a thing as
protruding the ozone layer
To find new species
on the stars
I will feel great
Without my weight
pulling me down
Would I still feel myself
when I hit the ground

Somewhere down the line
Man created god in his image
Inadequacy on a pedestal
A basin for a lake of tears to drown in
And here we go again
Where there's blood there's hirudineans
Crawling from every hole, blotting blindly
A brainless mob on the prowl
Sycophants cough their amen
Follow the light at the end of auricle
Egos inflate as the bugs migrate
Every blurp a revelation, an oracle
Fall, fall, fall, like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck, suck, suck, till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away, splitting heads with their drone
I will not waste my time
I will not waste my anger
Trying to find the head on a worm
With a rectum on either end
A lie in a frame is still profanity
A ghoul with a crown can never be king
Even crap will succumb to vanity
Its own stench the measure of all things
Fall, fall, fall, like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck, suck, suck, empty heads run amok
Choking on self-digesting misery
Eyes will open
Only when the ass starts burning
Atrophied tentacles start groping
Always loping, never learning
Deeper and deeper
Into the swamp you sing with every word
To rot on its bottom
Until the stink heralds the next outpour of turds
Fall, fall, fall, like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck, suck, suck, till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away, splitting heads with their drone
Fall, fall, fall, like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck, suck, suck, empty heads run amok
Choking on self-digesting misery

Cannibus
Make love to my companions
Red eye flight
Soar higher than the canyons
Comfort my lungs
Seduce my breath
Green stench miracles
Pour fires into my words
Children of mental awareness

Brought here by sorrow
Raised in the depths of fear
Consuming sanity
Feasting on the joy of Man
Surrounding the trembling mind
Surrounding the troubled soul
Strength failed to tame the serpent
The offspring of laughter and sadness
Saved by the power of its kin
Obeying the whispering chaos
Pulsating underneath your skin
Feasting 'till the end of time
Denying all peace within
Fearing the freedom it never feels
Bounded by allegiance
To long gone sanity
It hurts deep below
Emerge at the last step

Suffer me.This is the last time i hold myself from anger.There is no such thing as a 1 true love.I'm constantly looking towards something better;it makes no sense for me to look above.Baby rosemary,what have you brought today for me,this life has nothing for me tell me if your up to trade.I'll take anything you offer today I'm feeling brave.Oh tell me are you willing,I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and take all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.I'm the one who owns you I want to be your king.Dark night dark sky...I'm ready for your offer;serve it to me silver plate.This is the feast of ages;tonight we dine on perfect hate.Oh tell me are you willing.I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.Be the one who controls you I want to be you king.I want you to suffer.I'm just still looking for a trade.The deal I have is not working he never even hears me speak and with this new lack of concern new management i seek.Oh tell me are you willing I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.Be the one who controls you I want to be you king.Suffer unto me,I want you to suffer unto me,cause I'll be the new designer.I gave you everything you gave away.I gave you everything,thing to say.Suffer unto me.

How many people can I hate in my mind
With an intention of murder
Have the people fear me
The people bleeding
Once they're conditioned, it's easy to provoke aggression
This premonition is evil
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
Killing begets more killings
The blood lust begins
What kind of visions can I build in my mind
To harvest the hearts of the people
To create the fever you need a reason
Once they're conditioned, it's easy to provoke aggression
This premonition is evil
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
It makes me feel alive in my eyes
It makes all the pain subside
Just out after sunset
I take a walk down the streets
Ya know, try to clear the head
And I feel like I gotta put my fist upon the wall
Feel the cold concrete as it tears apart my ??
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm breaking down now (x4)
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm breaking down
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel
Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm fucking up
Take it, feel it, you freak
I can't get out
Take it, feel it,

They raise their glasses, as he surveys unseen
Wrath is increasing, anger makes his eyes gleam
Seeing his foes, celebrating their victory
He gives a promise, that he will destroy his enemy
Godforsaken fools..... I will return
Raise, raise, my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves, into the night
Raise, raise, my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves, into the night
As he stands nearby, he speaks the incantation
Tearing the dead, back from their damnation
Ground starts to quake, as they return from their graves
Thousands of corpses, rushing ahead like waves
Godforsaken fools..... I will return
Raise, raise, my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves, into the night
Raise, raise, my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves, into the night
Follow him blind, they have heard his call
Incessantly marching, heading for the fall
Clattering blades, made to strike and kill
Thirsting for blood, their task they will fulfill
Raise, raise, the dark fiends of light
Up from your graves, into the night
Raise, raise, the dark fiends of light
Up from your graves, into the night

Graverobbing cemeteries, body parts I steal
Using the meat and flesh, to consist of my meal,
Often necrophilia invades my deranged twisted head,
Spending sexual tensions making love to the dead,
This is my way of life as now it shall remain,
Fetishes for organs sick thoughts within my brain.
I butcher and slaughter my fellow man,
I after the food chain with each sick plan,
Human meat fresh or from the grave,
Satisfies my insatiable cannibal crave
Some nights I dress in ornaments of flesh,
Beneath the night I dig for organs not so fresh,
The sight of a corpse makes me salivate,
I know I'm mentally sick, these thoughts aren't right,
Compelled to make use of the deceased,
For the craving on human meat I'll feast,
Dining upon my own related species,
Digesting the race of man into my feces.
[repeat chorus]

Born into oblivion
Without the fear of existing all alone
Later comes the acquisition, forced upon
The solitude now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt
Psychopathic shepherds
Deny the miracle of our essence
And yet we have part in the blame
Allowing their ravings
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to live
Trust no one
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
Black, white, shadows, gods
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground
No one steals what no one owns
No one steals what no one owns
Disown and distance
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
No one steals what no one owns
One by one by one
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
No need for companionship
Back into the silence, silence
It is all it needs
Desolation
Alone in birth
Alone in darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight
One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination, I
All can be reached from within
All can be reached from within
Born into oblivion
Without the fear of existing all alone
Later comes the acquisition forced upon
The solitude, now loneliness
The God now submerged in a game of guilt
Psychopathic shepherds
Deny the miracle of our essence
And yet we have part in the blame
Allowing their ravings
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to live
Trust no one
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

I have come to unfold your mind
In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold
Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminious sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light
I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart
I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive

Removal of the eyes gives my heart a saddened chill
I preserve them in formaldehyde to gaze upon at will
How their greenish flecks befell me that starlit winter's night
I lost all that I ever was while locked within their sight
Before you sits a broken man, your fragile pinkish heart in hand
Peculiar how it can hurt so bad while love is only in the mind
I sew the gaping chest work, each thread is made with love
The bosom where I would rest my face is covered in your blood
No, this is not the end
You'll live on eternally
Oh Lord, it's not the end
My secret you'll forever be
I interrupt this transformation, a familiar lust swelling in me
A long and soulful kiss, the shades are drawn, the living world can't see
The coil of entrails, how curious the smell
So pungent to my eager nostrils, hands further compelled
No, it's not the end
Forever you'll be in my arms
I could never let you go, my darling, cold and blue
I wonder, are you dreaming still, spread eagled, blood removed
I weave the sucking trocar beneath your bruising skin
Tonight I'll lay beside you, darling, in necromantic sin
Pinned to the bed sheets like a prized butterfly, you're mine
I hear your voice so precious, echoing deeply inside
I did my best to love you while you did live and breathe
This tender taxidermy, trophy of the bereaved
I could never let you go, my darling, cold and blue
I wonder, are you dreaming still, spread eagled, blood removed
I weave the sucking trocar beneath your bruising skin
Tonight I'll lay beside you, darling, in necromantic sin

I who wait and writhe and wrestle
With air that hath no boughs to nestle
My body weary of empty clasp
Strong as a lion and sharp as an asp
Give me the sign of the Open Eye
And the token erect of the thorny thigh
And the word of madness and mystery
Scapegoat
I am a man
Do as thou wilt as a great god can
I am awake
In the grip of the snake
The eagle slashes with beak and claw
The gods withdraw
The great beasts come
Scapegoat
Goat of thy flock I am gold I am god
Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod
Thrust the sword through the galling fetter
With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to equinox
All-devourer, all-bequetter

Thickening mass of reality
Curve the existence descends to zero
Crowd loosing its colors
Tightening nature points at the middle
Weighing of central point
The other side of existence arrives
Reflection of what is known devours imperfection
Existence is defective by nature
Highest independence- sacred zero
Final order-sacred zero
Lack of imperfection-sacred zero

I can only imagine that wrath is being held out
So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I have seen the madness of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased
We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still, for there is still beauty
Inside this dying world
For what good is there holding off wrath
If we are determined to bring wrath upon ourselves
Wrath upon ourselves
To bring wrath upon ourselves
We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still, for there is still beauty
Inside this dying world
We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still, for there is still beauty
Inside this dying world

Poseidon loved Cleito
A new dynasty was born
Five twin pairs to be kings
Demigods are enthroned
Colorless blood
Power of the Gods
They would perish and die
Without the sacred sap
Mysterious
Fluid of the Gods
When they shed their blood
Mortals die by just one touch
Their destiny will ever be
Bound with them all even if they rise or fall
Their destiny will ever be
Bound to the oath they gave by their birth
Ichor blood of Gods
Dynasty of ten kingdoms
Realm of demigods
Ten kings of mighty strength
Immortal blood in their veins
Colorless blood
Power of the Gods
They would perish and die
Without the sacred sap
Mysterious
Fluid of the Gods
When they shed their blood
Mortals die by just one touch
Their destiny will ever be
Bound with them all even if they rise or fall
Their destiny will ever be
Bound to the oath they gave by their birth
Ichor blood of Gods
Atlas and Gadeirus, Ampheres and Evaemon
Mneseus and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor
Azaes and Diaprepes
Rulers of Atlantis
Colorless blood
Power of the Gods
They would perish and die
Without the sacred sap
Their destiny will ever be
Bound with them all even if they rise or fall
Their destiny will ever be
Bound to the oath they gave by their birth
Ichor blood of Gods

Welcome, and wake up
This is not a dream but something in between that and reality
Wake up if you dare
This is not the regular nightmare
Before your eyes the world will change
Slowly take you down to unknown places
Welcome to a world that's only yours
Wake up if you dare and just follow me!
Leave me alone
My dreams speak to me or am I still awake?
Leave me alone
I'm my own threat, I'm a victim of my mind
Let go
I fooled you, I warned you though
I won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams
I'll play you
You want me to
You ask for more
You want to know
Leave me now, I need to know I'm in control
Leave me alone
Leave me be within my private fantasies
Let go
I told you you, I won't let go
I want to show you what dreams can do for you
They'll free you, they'll open doors
They show you all you want to know
As some is light and some is dark, dreams can be both
They have two sides
Fear
I am your fear deep inside
Fear
Face all your fears deep in this dream
We are the dark side of your mind
Pain
I am your pain deep inside
Pain
Feel all your pain deep in this dream
Feel it's a part of you
You are like your dreams, both light as dark
Come with us now and explore
Silence, I'm here
No words, no sounds, no pain or doubts
I'm floating
Even time itself can never touch me
I am free
Silence, I'm here
No voices, no music
I'm roaming through this soundless place
Leave me here where I am free
Doubt
I am your doubt deep inside
I am all you try to hide
Hate
I am your hate deep inside
I am your mirror, your fright
Energized by nightly views
You are the dream, the dream is you
Aah
So face it, you know I'm right
You have no reason to resent me and fight
You are me and I am you
The other side of the sleepy truth
Leave me please, how can I rest with you inside?
Leave me alone, I'm too tired for these crazy theories
Let go
I'll leave you, but won't let go, for I am part of all you'll ever do
I'll help you, I'll open doors and show you all you need to know
For I'm your dream energizer

Born again harder
Than I was before
Bringing the hammer down
Is more than metaphor
I live by the steel
Die by the blade
What reason is there to be
If you're living life afraid?
[Chorus]
The hammer is my symbol
The banner that I wave
The motto of my creed
Carved upon my grave
I life for the here and now
I live for the knife
My coat of arms
Is the hammer and life
Fear and cowardice
Harbingers of demise
Strength and the will to fight
Will lead you to the prize
Glory to all of those
Who conquer to the end
Honor the hammer
On it you can depend
[Chorus]

RAGING about us
The signs of war are coming,
SPACE migrator
Your presence ever, haunting...
Bloodpools of tears
The gods cursed forever,
The walls of Giza
Their message was so clear,
From the walls of the ocean
From the waters they rise.
Share their wings they will take us
Hundred light years in minutes,
Split through the Cosmos
The Universe is falling,
Earth base II, the city underwater,
See Atlantis is rising
Watch the skeptic Is sinking,
From atop of the Andes
Stands our city of gold,
YOU CAN'T STOP IT,
IT'S ALREADY COMING
TOOLATE! NO HIDING
THEY'RE CMNG FROM THE AIR...
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE!!!
YOU CANT STOP IT
IT'S ALREADY COMING
TOO LATE! NO HIDING
THEY'RE COMING FROM THE AIR...
As you fly straight into
A sudden change in the weather,
Feel the power will crush you...
Accept, you don't stand a chance
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE...

Fear and sweat, my muscles ache
I smile, but it's just a fake
I fade away
It troubles me, what you're gonna say
Just a day away
And you will be here to stay
I wait and I wait
And what I really hate
Is the panic that stops me from breathing
My knees hit the floor
And I panic more
Until you open my door

Life of desperation that's his way
Searching for a light to shine today, but I know that I won't
Help me Jesus can't you feel my pain
I'm so tired, twisted and insane, taken a look in my eyes
There's no living! Forgiving! God help me please!
[Chorus]
I'm lost in the dark
I don't know which way I'm facing
I reach to feel my way, a life caught in the maze
There's no living! Forgiving! God help me please!
[Chorus: x2]
Institution, no solution, this is destiny I know
Living, living, scared of dying, wondering where it is I'll go
Oh no, no no
Oh no, no no
Lost in the dark
Lost in the dark

Pedophile priest a preacher of sodomy,
Innocent children giving head to blasphemy,
In the catholic church religions is his role,
To speak the lord's word he had devoted his soul,
Committed to the church and a vow of celibacy,
His holiness burns with sexual tensions and religious lunacy,
He pushes inside, they cry as their anus rips,
From their tender lips his unholy semen drips,
Sodomizing boys within the house of God,
Screaming as they rectally accept his prod,
Withdrawing his bloody penis now hard as a rock,
He takes a page of scripture and with it wipes his cock,
He quotes the Bible to his daily congregation,
His buttocks bleed from the choir boys flagellation,
A molester of innocence, violating with every deed,
So many times among chapel pews he has spent his seed,
Children he baptizes know of his crucifix of skin,
He makes it holy in their mouths as they choke it in.

Stand up and be counted
For what you are about to receive
We are the dealers
We'll give you everything you need
All hail to the good times
'Cause rock has got the right of way
Gonna let you go tomorrow
We're living for today
Chorus:
For those about to rock, we salute you

We rock at dawn, like a hurricane
Like a bolt right out of the blue
The sky's alight with the guitar _pain/bite_

Aimed at you old friend (???)

I took a walk down West 11
I had to wade through 500 European punks
At an off-license I rubbed up with some oiks*
Who threw some change on the Asian counter
And asked polite if they could have two lagers
A hospital discharge asked me where he could crash

Spare a thought for the sleeping promo dept.
They haven't had an idea in two years
Dollars and deutchmarks keep the company on its feet
Say have you ever have a chance to meet
Fat Captain Beefheart imitators with zits?
Who is the King Shag Corpse?
Have you been to the English Deer Park?
It's a large type minstrel ranch
This is where C Wilson wrote Ritual in the Dark
Have you been to the English Deer Park?
The young blackies get screwed up the worst
They've gone over to the Hampstead house suss
An English system they implicitly trust
See the A&R; civil servants
They get a sex thrill out of a sixteenth of Moroccan

You're the youth bangers fight forever more
Raise your golden hammer bring it down like Thor
Ooh the force is going to bring us victory
No foe or rival will stop the energy
It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind
It's the march of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
Clench your fist a battle's on the way
Shout the truth metal's here to claim the day
Hear the crowd's mighty roar
It verifies assurance that we won another war
It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind
It's the march of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed think
Like daybreak in spring
The sun on a spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn
But how do I feel
In my gloomy depths?
A black winter day
No, darker than that
Gloomier than an autumn night

What the fuck happened to the youth of today?
They'd rather praise the face of a boy on a stage
There's so many things to say about the way we raise our kids to
Believe of what a hero can be and how much weight you can hold to his name
I refuse to believe that weve lost of sense of humanity like a locust to the plague
I am not the man, you should follow to your knees
False profits pave the way for the mindless fools that make up everyday society
I sit patently and wait for the world to crumble beneath my feet
I am the voice of single man, but I can see how pathetic this life can be
Sit back and wait for this game to be played
And watch them expire in the heat that they've made
There's little they can say about the way they've lead so many kids astray
By the bullshit they feed them and the things that preach
There's no telling how far their voices will reach
Does anybody else see what were doing?
I swear I'm losing my mind
Wake the fuck up
I want to watch your story burn
I want to see the look on your face when your
Gimmick is exposed and you're lost inside your head
The real heroes of today are the men and woman
Who fight for what is right and what some of us still believe
That there's more to life than just money and the need for greed
Where will you go when your 15 minutes of fame
Are up and you're outside the circle?
And you're left with nothing but your ego
Would you sell your soul?
I sit patiently and wait for the world to crumble beneath my feet
I am the voice of single man
But I can see how pathetic this life can be
Sit back and wait for this game to be played
And watch them expire in the heat that they've made
There's little they can say about
The way they've lead so many kids astray
By the bullshit they feed them and the things that preach
There's no telling how far their voices will reach
Does anybody else see what we're doing?
I swear I'm losing my mind. I swear I'm losing my mind

[Secret message: first letters of each line compose word "SATAN" in a verse]
Silent watching gaze
Across the blackened plains
Two eyes like burning embers
Awaits the moment for the
North star to blaze
Sythanagon winged
Angel rides deaths wind
To cloudless sky
And sound a summon call of war
Now burn does the skyline
Soundless wings lacerate the night
Angels of death emerge across the sky
Thorned heads spiky limbs climb the air up high
Attack of the pearly gates
Now wait for the sign
Seen now is His star
Ablaze now risen in
The sign of the one with
A number not a name
Now given is the sign
The Golden walls of heaven
Sound is given now of charge
A voice of war does cry
The cry does sound the signal
And the walls are stormed
Now fly
Swords are drawn in soundless flight
Above the walls of gold
The winged angels of death descend
A thousand from above
Now heaven is in its' last throes of death
Sacred shrine of life and death
Apharamons gold key
The raping of holy interior
And all concealed
Now masturbated upon is throne of gold
Scattered battered wings
Along the palaces and streets
Trophy of the victory
Attached to spear of the Beast
Now spitted at is the scalp of God.

Catch the rainbow if you can
It will always be ahead of you
Years passing swifter than you ever thought
Today will soon be behind you
And the future remains out of reach
Hunting the sun, setting at the horizon
When shadows threat to swallow your weak soul
The key of light, the solution of all
I saw it clearly behind the veil of reality
And as I dreamed the lilies white
In the shade of a birch
They withered in the frost of awakening
Fiery the angels fell from the spires of my fortress of youth
Silent explosions in my universe of pain
Appease my hunger, defeat my solitude
And let me follow where daydreams go
When ambitions fall
Watch the sky, there is proof of your transience
The stars that saw the birth of four ancestors
Shall watch our descendants last steps on earth
So, unnoticed we will pass away,
Like a flickering in the perpetual chaos
The time bird rose from it's nest of bones
And thrust it's beak in my eye
With the beat of charging wings
My transience was confirmed
Time perhaps for a salutary sleep
I still long for that silent land of dreams
Where the flames expire, where the spark fades
And hunger is born again

She's the master. I'm the slave.
Yet submissive just the same
Got my heart out on a tray
Seasons it to taste
She dominates
Bridge:
From beyond, she is calling
Haunting in my sleep
Chorus:
Oh she has put a spell on me (x3)
Sold my soul
My evil one
My devil doll
In stilettos and a whip
Says that Satan is her bitch
Got the chronic and the crypt
Even Jesus Christ is on her tip
Bridge
Chorus
Bridge
Chorus
Sold my soul
My evil one
My devil doll

all is lost
my will to live was taken today
the fire that used to burn
my heart
blown out cold
by winds too great
to hold at bay
all is lost
purpose and cause
betrayed
humilty torn
from my fingers
snatched
hope has turned
and clouded grey
who will take the pain
and shield me
shape my heart
and never leave me
empty or invisible
who will take the pain away?

Her painted stare
Her silky hair
Her ghostly glare
Burns holes everywhere
I waited long
I held out strong
One step beyond
On my mind all day long
I want to blame uncontrolled desire
It set my fury free
The level of my need shot up higher
Confused my mind guaranteed
She's a burning question
Does the answer lie up ahead
Burning question
The eternal flames fire red
My make believe
It made me leave
Had to achieve
Every part of her that breathed
I want to blame it all on obsession
It set my fury free
It's a fine line between possession
And smothering at the seams
She's a burning question
Does the answer lie up ahead
Burning question
The eternal flames fire red
It's got the shrewd man mesmerized
Perplexed and hypnotized
The rule of thumb sure ain't on the rise
Lost
Losing control
Raging up from my soul
Violence is in command
Her life is in my hand
Inside my hand
I want to blame uncontrolled desire
It set my fury free
The level of my need shot up higher
Confused my mind guaranteed
She's a burning question
Does the answer lie up ahead
Burning question
The eternal flames fire red
It's got the shrewd man mesmerized
Perplexed and hypnotized
The rule of thumb sure ain't on the rise
Burning question
Burning question
Burning question

While the seventh king of dawn is veiled by the shrouds of shadows,
And the crown of the saint is turned into rusty blades of the beast
Rise, my children of hatred,
Feel the aura of the embracing night,
You're the ones who have been foreseen,
Feeding the flames on the pyre of the reborn one
"Hail, the new king!"
On the throne...
"Of the Northern realm!"
The skies of crimson are now crying,
For the dawn that never will break again,
Yilded looks in eyes of the angels,
While falling down... Pounding the soil of the unholy
Crowned by the wreath of the demons,
Ordained by the profane rites,
Veil once so white is now burning,
In the fire of the sinful one
Baptized by the blood of angels,
Gained the heart of the darkest kind,
In his veins flows the soul of ravens
For the end... For the dusk of humankind

Farewell friend until tomorrow. Where you are still
Nitpicking our diets and names. The potential is still
There yet it's somehow unexpected. I'll show you
Courage if you show me responsibility. Something lost
Long ago in trying to please everyone. In pleasing
Ourselves. If it feels good it must be right. Right?
So what's a child? A fetus or kink in sexual
Revolution and what am I? A threat, a kink in
Political consistency. More name games and more
Personal choice. So where's mine? Or are you to deal
Me such luxuries. Call me what I am and mean every
Word. Be prepared to take yours. You see you're not
Along. I'll show you responsibility if you show me
Reasoning. Something you never possessed. You always
Coveted anger and vengeance. But for what? One less
Bite, one less burden. I'm sick of being the bastard.
Keep your fight and know I'll keep mine.

Come inside of me
Come inside of me
Lucifer my friend
You are the one that comprehends
You are the one that helps me see
You are the one that let me be
Come inside of me
You are the one that hold me hand
You are the one that understands
You are the keeper of my soul
You are the one that makes me whole
You are the keeper of my soul
You are the one that makes me whole
You are the keeper of my soul
Make me whole
Reborn with open eyes
Now I see the lies
Raining from the skies - bleed
Penetrated souls
Feeding all their holes
Mastering their roles - meek
Come inside of me
I will help you see
Be all you can be - free

On your honor, on your honor
Let me explain my behavior
On your honor, on your honor
I swear, I was trying to save her
Who's the liar, who's the killer?
She knows I was doing a favor
When I fell upon her
By way of a merciful murder
With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes, I know what I've done
And what I'm gonna do
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
Yes, I know what I've done
And what I'm gonna do
No weakness, no weakness
Don't buckle under the pressure
A servant, a serf
A saint for all those who suffer
We're caught in a current of confusion
But what's been suggested
And what has been proved?
With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes, I know what I've done
And what I'm gonna do
I am, I am only what you made me now
I am a reflection of your wealth
And if you think, you think you hate me now
You only hate yourself
With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes, I know what I've done
And what I'm gonna do

Attack! welcome you're thrown to the spot you live inside the war
Casualties of world wide death on the last of the poor
Bloodthined, join the feast you'll be served the preys of the scheme
Methodical woolgathering malpracticed by the supreme
Eradicate the final goal, prosperity the single cause
Like a nuclear time bomb they'll send you into war
Born inside this living hell
Prison bars of social arrest, detonation of inner rage
piercing loss of consciousness til the end of future days
tattered until you're in the ditch, no one asks or cares when you get lost
be another entry in the system be a slave , conform, consume for any costs
Eradicate the final goal, prosperity the single cause
Like a nuclear time bomb they'll send you out to war
Come and face agony
tortured and born inside this living hell
A time bomb, they send you into war
tortured, mistreated and broken down
Now you're chances have died, a living hell has begun, you're born into a world of
a world full of lies! We share the burden to bleed, we shall remain to fight
Dirty blood on every hand, isolated intimately
toxicated formation, interaction of stupidity
Eradicate the final goal, prosperity the single cause
Like a nuclear time bomb they'll send you into war
Come and face agony
tortured and born inside this living hell

I cannot scream, my mouth is wired shut
I cannot see, my eyes are filled with blood
I must die while suffering
Pawn of torturous punishment
Losing all reason to live
Cherishing this painful death
To become part of the
Dead human collection
Dead human collection
I cannot hear with punctured ear drums
I can barely breathe,
My ribs are crushed
I will die while suffering
Maimed, repulsive menagerie
Collection for the insane
Closer to death I become
I want to be one with the dead
Collection of dead humans, dead
I want to be one with the dead
Collection of dead humans, dead
I want to be one of them
Compilation obscene
An assembly for psychotic malefaction
Virulent anarchy
The final member of this vile congregation
I cannot scream, my mouth is wired rot
I cannot see, my eyes turned into dust
I died into the
Dead human collection
Dead human
Dead human
Dead human collection

As I fight, trying to escape
Covering my soul
Watching the flames
I must understand this wizard
Fire is everything
It burns, I provoke, It's beyond
I feel, I create light
Hypnotizing power I can't resist
Reach out my hands, I feel the light
Increase flames, the heat is oppressive
Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in...
Enter now so deep the flames,
I respect the silence
Overcome with cold I pray
I see all the trees, the sky
The grass, the oceans
I embrace the world below
And I know now all the reasons
And all the countries
Fire begins and fire ends
Oh it burns, fire is all...

[English translate: Earth Summoning Us]
to you I now descend, oh you, deluded souls.
and to purge your sorrow, you forlorn spirits,
the curse I shall invoke
the misanthropic curse, with its sordid, purple claws
to carve your forehead, instead of cattlebrand
with iron burnt in fire
in vain will pride be seethed in veins dried up and scorched
in death-swallowed eyeballs, on foreheads purple-hued
by putrid blood that died
what can I ever chose from your exhausted entity
no fires free from dying, no undeceiving right
oh, you dead men walking
see, how urns now burst, the ashes resurrect
alike the past, which murmurs with the battle-cry
of the roman empire
see the far-off shadows, they dress in steely armour
and raise their noble foreheads that gone grey
great traian and great cesar
the rotten thrones are crumbling swept by tempests waters
the rulers iron scepters, the heavy chain of slaves
together are now crushed
the gates of the inferno outrageously wide-opened
engulfing now by thousands the filthy, depraved breaths
of tyrants grim who perish
oh, holy visionary minds, who set the stars to sing...
who create another world on this realms of mud and grime
fools and wise, young and old, sound, soul and light
all is dust, the world's like this, and so we all are

Pain like you've never felt before
Your face instantly grated and scraped along the sidewalk
Chiseled up, filed down and a concrete crown
I've got your face to the curb
With my pleathur boot you'll learn life is cheap
Let's have a sacrifice in which we take your life
Straight through your mouth denting your dentin
The power I uphold
Teeth and concrete now mold
Shaved and scraped
Hovering above your twitching, bloody mouth that still keeps bitching:
Just tell me why?
Why? Because you are human
O, the insanity the humanity
Toothless gash gives new meaning to cavities
Filing the enamel revealing the dentine
Gouging out pulp, separation of cementum
Disintegrating through maxillar scraping
Mandible and glottis now raw and pulsating in a jellied heap
Your incisors on the pavement
A brutal end to your enslavement life is cheap
Let's have a sacrifice where your teeth merge with your eyes
Sinus collape blunt facial prolapse
The power I uphold
Teeth and concrete now mold
Shaved and scraped
Hovering above your twitching, bloody mouth that still keeps bitching, begging me, please
O, death
Such a tease
O, the insanity the humanity
Toothless gash gives new meaning to cavities

Learn from my sins
The concept of our misery tried to the dreams
day after day
trying to escape this certain call to earth's embrace
[Chorus]
Another day lies, another day dies
Another day bleeding our time untold
Another day lies, another day cries
Another day lies bleeding our time untold
So strong was the bound
To alters of eternity ,ade of cold stone
But weak is our form cast in to the day by the will of God
[Chorus]
Burning my wings in the same fire from which I'm born
to follow the light, to follow myself
burning my wings, burning my fate
wouldn't you like to know why the wings of life fade
withered by our own tears, burned by a faking grace
A failed grace...a failed grace

A melody.
So charming beautiful and short
Picks wind to bind and sound so lonely
In the lowering sky among the clouds
The sky ships never knowing rest
My shadow, echo to remain... maybe...
In times no hands to join again
And paths will lay apart in sleep
So dreamless, filled with the ice wind
>From somewhere, wouldn't like to know
Just smile and watch the storm advent...
I am mortal on this ruthless day
Crashed by its steal jaws being downtrodden to his own trace
Faceless but still having my will
Though watching this eternal rain
At the edge now
Just to make a step
Down the road I'm meant to be on
So you thought "I can't fly"
And that appears to be so easy
Leave me, I've chosen
I take this day
With all its hate and despair
So lifeless, gray and exitless
The last day among the lost days
In this hell where I am the only lie
Forever lie like you are
Waiting for the sunrise
The step to the endless night

One deceiver
Among millions of others
One look
And you lover forever
One word
And you're the one to blame
Tell me
Who could live with this shame?
Something seems to be dead here
Undergo deconstruction
The symmetry of fear
Strange lack of seduction
My sister remember
Sister...
Sister...
Sister...
Sister September
An inner war is to come
Still he doesn't want to succumb
An ineffable loss of trust
One story
Turning into diamond dust
Something seems to be dead here
Undergo deconstruction
The symmetry of fear
Strange lack of seduction
My sister remember
It's obviously beyond his power
All certainties move towards their end
One question
And so many answers
Where's the crown he once transcend?
Sister September
Where are the dream's you've stuck in me?
Sister remember
I shall never, never forget the name of your devotee
A moment of beauty
Still it remains only a memory
A stunning artifact of the past
The one, the true, the last
Do I have to die under this autumnal sun?
Did I have to trust you?
Truly and madly and blindly
And what did I get in return?
Sister...
Sister...
Sister...
Sister September
Shall never forget the name of your devotee
Where are the dreams you have stuck in me?
An eternity of torture to me
Such a lot of pain

I'm hearing your reproachful words / Within seconds my rage is blackening me
out / This feeling is way too much for me / I'm crying out my disbelief /
Can't handle you showing discontent / After all this time you do not know me
at all / Can't you just handle the truth / You're letting me down
forevermore / Reality becoming crystal-clear / Don't bother me with your
pathetic dreams / You stigmatised my fate / I would die for seeing you
suffer my disbelief / This is the end of the line / Not endless after all /
You've got to get away from here / Far away from here

Soldier of sunlight
Welcome to the kingdom of ignorance
Where all the tears of ages tell their tales
No one dares to break the spell
No one dares to fly
Time is running out you can't deny
How many times
Have you found yourself under the influence?
How many times has a mirror mad you cry?
Now it's time to stand upright
Tear down your inner door
The birth of yourself can't wait no more
In your mind there's a battle raging on
Try to find what you're fighting for
[Chorus]
Wake up the king
From his sleep in your fantasy
Wake up the king
Let him be all you ecstasy
Tears flow to rivers
And rivers to oceans of broken dreams
Have you ever heard of tears of joy?
Show yourself a sense of life
Open up your eyes
Let your heartbeat be your best advice
In your eyes I can see the fire burn
Realize, now it is your turn
[Chorus]
Look at the mountain, look at the sun
Feel all the pure energy
Birds fly and whisper, call out your name
They belong to you and you're the
King of a kingdom, light in your hand
Look at what you have never seen
Walk on a rainbow, look to the stars
Cry it out and make your dream come true
[Chorus x 2]
Can't you see the crown?
(...and the vision continued: "There is less sense in complaining than looking for your skills...")

A paralyzed mind embracing decay
Dead like carrion just wasting away
There is nothing
Numbed by excess and complete saturation
Scarred influence by degeneration
There is nothing
There is nothing to believe
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
Dead like carrion
We must carry on
There is nothing
Lost innocence and blank revelations
Searching for a hope in static transmissions
There is nothing
There is nothing to believe
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
There is no reason for empty vision
All has been lost
All have lost their way
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
There's no reason for empty vision

Kingdom of the dead. world breaks apart. thunder spreads across the lands.
Now we`ve come here to kill you and we won`t leave until you died.
In your blood we kneel emotionless we`ll watch your end.
Now we`ve come here to kill you and we won`t leave until you died.
Soon you will be king in your kingdom of the dead...endless torture laments of fear no mourning your kingdom`s near
While the earth is crying mankind`s slowly dying we stand in the ruins of civilization
Mankind`s slowly dying we spit on your grave the kingdom of the dead.

[Music: Christophe, Lyrics: Sven]
Murder
I have been embraced by suffering,
No longer human, I stalk my prey
To kill and gut all surrounding me
Humanity in me slips away
Into the basement,
My own private morgue
Necrotic restants are left to devour
Lunacy errupts from the world you breed
Nothing survives as I consume my meat
Depraved in my sea of cartilage
I'm draved in gore
I have been embraced by suffering,
No longer human, I stalk my prey
To kill and gut all surrounding me
My humanity slips from me
Into the basement,
My own private morgue
Necrotic restants are left to devour
Lunacy errupts from the world you breed
Nothing survives as I consume my meat
Severed head as ornament
My collection of the dead
Punctured cranial-walls collapse
Filled with acid
My aphrodisiac...
I will not rest...
Until I've killed you all
I will not rest...
Until your head
Hangs on the wall of suffering
No longer human, it takes control
Feelings overwhealming me
I have to rid the earth
Of human anatomy
I will not rest, until i've killed you all
Exposed and gutted in my hall of gore
Murder the world... let the blood run... free...
Infected, by this disease called love
I must fill my private morgue
Dissecting randomly,
Your voluptuous cadaver into soup I'll render
Can no longer bear this suffering
I am your god, your tortured will
No longer human it takes control
Destined to torture, mutilate and destroy

Tearing beneath your feet
Feel the ground split and crack and crumble beneath you
Calamity serves a nightmare
Never to wake from these dreams of destiny
[Chorus]
All are buried
New earth's eyes turn black
Struggle to cling to your mind
Grasping at twines to hold your world together
Replacing the truth
Breathe in the proof
And pray your god is forever
[Chorus]
All are silent
Full with old dirt
All are stifled
Earth's hand turns to fist
Forget, erase, the monster you made and the hate that you save
In time, you'll find, you'll learn to grow in the new world
Ushering in the sun
Barren earth smiles and greets its warmth with awareness
Gathering clouds, earth drinks the rain
And plans the birth of its new gods
[Chorus]
All arising
Purged of sickness
Soil transcending
Cast fulfilling
All are present
Born of earth
New gods

All of a tremble
You can feel their poison arrows
Have left their mark
Higher and higher
Wanna seize the day
While you're waiting for the dark
You're running from the disdain
You know this time
You won't turn around
Chasing an illusion, disillusion
Desire leading, downward bound
Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line
I'm a believer on the receiving end
Of the bat they hold with grace
Dead to the voices of the anxious
Timid of him who must not be named
Enticing me away now as the sun sets
To the truth that lies beyond
I'm chasing an illusion, an illusion
Revelation I'm coming home
Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line
You turn your back on the one
Willing to make up his mind
No you never stood in my shoes
Evil versus divine
You're feeling drawn to purity
Like a moth to the flame
Light at the end of the tunnel
Strange how the voice of the savior
Roars like a train
Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

Torment raging through my veins
While the sun is shining - I decay
You will die by my teeth, for I am your reaper
In eternal night, in eternal winter
[Chorus:]
Suffer and die, I'm the return of your death
You thought you could escape
Eternal winter freezes your breath!
Demons...calling your name
They want to tear your soul away
Into your eyes I stab a splinter
See the eternal night, the eternal winter
In Siberia I live on my own
In a hut which is built of your bones
In search of my wife, where can I find her
In eternal night, in eternal winter
You wear guilt of her death
Jesus Christ - that's one reason why I hate you
Fall from grace - my son will kill your father
In eternal night, in eternal winter
[Chorus:]
Eternal Winter!

Devilish cold surrounds me
Everything feels so untrue
Am I real, do I exist
Am I dreaming, do I dream...
Opened my eyes to see what I feel
Truth lies beneath under me
Trail of blood and trace of anger
Makes me continue my journey for free...
Follow the blood 'til the ravens scream
Then you know you've reached what you seek
Taste the blood 'til the wolves howl
Then you know you've reached what you bow...
The blood on the path that says
Follow right thru this way
Realizing that's just blood
Dripping from me, only from me
On my path...I've been there
On your path...I've been here
On this path...Have I been there
On this path...have I been here
There's no sense nor reason
Alone I am, and yes it is real
Path of circle, walk forever
Never will find a way out here...

Children, babies and boys
that live in this century
want to destroy
all that is possible
with their evil minds
with their sharpest knives
and horrible eyes.
Nazi babies with cadaver eyes
emerge from the ocean
to bring destruction
life crazy monsters
with countless tentacles
advance in the darkness
on a hopeless night.
They leave the message of their evolution
the scheme of a life
based on our death
They have no feelings
and no human genes
they're only machines
come forth from our dread.
Humanity needs new generations
so don't be surprised by their horrible eyes!

We are the hatred
Lucifer's fury combined
We are the abominations
The curse of mankind
Supreme, extreme, undivine
We're here to suppress
To extinguish the lies
Brandish the steel
The pestilence through time
Activate! Dominate! Obliterate! Crush!
Some things never change
Achievement comes through absolute power

My heart has never been enough
Breathing just barely gets me by
For a time the consequences
Of being human won't be undone by human hands
I turn my head and see it all falling apart
But you're still here, unphased by me
I'm holding on, I'm holding on to you
I move my eyes from fixation on a fallen world
I'm holding onto you, unphased by me
These walls fall down around me but I will stand
And though my body be burned away
I will live life

As cyclones detach from the world above
And all the other worlds beneath them flow
Time winds caressing the dust of cold memories
Sought, to strive in twilight mist and penal fire
[Chorus]
As daylight suffers, night time recollects
For what wind hath drawn near, so near?
Death has a contract on life and hell in-between
What was once not certain is now foreseen
When the pendulum is in it's reverse factor
Rivers run red and skies turn black
Accuracies of bloodbaths liberate from within
Conquests of a crooked cross and its coming loss
A magisterial maintenance of diabolic education
Where the opposite of innocence paves way for intelligence
Where pearls are chained for each tragic event
The glorification of deviance in progress
Liars in wait tries to quench their thirst for more
Drowning victims of a parallel universe
The scum of the earth, a rejoice of fouls
The world hates you for being precise

Well, I can't get it off my mind
Said, I just can't seem to leave it behind
And it haunts me till this very day
And I don't think it's ever gonna go away
'Cause the people, yes, the common people
They be knowing this shit is real
Having a good time
Ain't committing no crime
Innocent victims
Pushed to the red line
We'll put you people into a line
Interrogate your mind, rape you one at a time
Don't say a word, shut up, and obey
Your opinion doesn't matter to us anyway
'Cause the more that you resist
Is the quicker you make the list
Making your own choice
Playing with the big boys
Pushing us too far
Gonna make a lot of noise
So don't forget the day
The people had something to say
Retribution is underway
Disturbing the peace

Theres a feeling at rise, it grinds my teeth, stings lungs, first instinct "draw with my guns" instead I just turn to run, run from the path of the first born son.
what's done is done and I know all and above time is not always enough no,
its not always enough, not always enough not always enough.
forget what you think what you believe what you know, cause in the end, its only you alone.
all I ever wanted to be was a father to you. Just like my father was to me.
If I admit to the guilt have faith and try to believe will forgiveness set me free?
Not a chance in hell.
so forget what you think what you believe what you know, when you finally reach the end it is you who stands alone. against your foes and the people you love the most.
face your ghosts!
you know this story is fucking getting old all I ever wanted to be was a father to you just like my father was to me, if I admit to the guilt have faith and try to believe will forgiveness set me free?
there's a feeling at rise, it grinds my teeth, stings lungs first instinct "Draw with my guns" instead I just turn to run, run from the path of the first born son what done is done and I know all and above time is not always enough no its not always enough not always enough not always enough no.

You don't think I know how this ends?*
I've heard these words before and there more meaningless now then they were then.
It feels like I'm drowning and you're oceans away.
It feels like I'm drowning and you dragged me out to sea.
I've got nothing but hate in my heart now watch me tear you apart.
I've got nothing but hate in my heart.
Burn me to ashes, then burn the ashes.
I'll carry this hate till I'm in my grave.
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
Sorrowspell, my world will never be the same. (2x)
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
I'll see you in hell.
My head was a house and all you brought in was lies.
Now my world shrinks and these four walls become a cell.
You told me the only way to heaven was to go through hell.
Burn me to ashes, then burn the ashes.
I'll carry this hate till I'm in my grave.
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
Sorrowspell, my world will never be the same. (2x)
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name. (2x)
Won't you close my eyes and let me sleep through this sorrowspell.
I've giving so much and I've fallen so hard, I've got nothing left to tell.
Won't you close my eyes and let me sleep through this sorrowspell.
Won't you close my eyes.

Too many times I've sat back and watched you destroy.
Your self destructive ways. Lost in your haze.
It buries you alive as you breathe your death in.
Too many times I've watched you slowly die.
I let you bleed as you breath your death in.
Melting. Melt away.
I've watched you die

The penetrating stares of judge and jury condemn emotion, dictate the standards of said principles and bore plasticity through your character. Life slowly turns into a sterile cage of uniformity and enforced morality. Tolerance is nothing but void. The individual has been canceled.

Bloodsuckers
You suck out the oil
For the salt of the earth
You ravage the soil
Strip mining mountains
You gauge out the face
You suffocate life
In an asphalt membrane
Don't eat your own heart
'cause you can never win
Bloodsuckers
You steal from the earth
You'll kill for the riches
And decide what it's worth

Forged in blood, raised in hell
Our souls, forever lost
Bodies feel the iron force
The anvil meets their flesh
Evil grabs the tortured souls
Of lives they did possess
Hatred in between unfolds
They're coming to distress
Our souls, forged in blood
By demons of the dead
Our mind, evilised
Abused to serve the bad
Our flesh, set to rot
To feed the ones below
Our blood starts to spill
And cleanse the sins we owe
Signs of death unto the wall
Bloodlines of the past
Creatures from the other side
The suffering is vast
Forged in blood, victimized
The truth depicts the lie
Lifeless bodies torturised
Slaves of flesh will die
Obey the sign of hell
Pounding into flesh
Breaking the morbid shell
And revel in their flesh
Condemned to bleed and rot
Crushing in despair
Forged in fucking evil blood
No one will ever care

Chiming of three bellscall
hear my cries for Satan I live in sin War I ride
Oh lord hear my bestial cries
Sacrificing of the lamb Son of Satan born of damned
Drink the vomit from the priest
Seven crowns of Hell prevail
[chorus]

Dawn found me lying on the ground
As soon as the night passed away
And the wind among the trees
Is watching me as a hunted game
I feel cold on the dewy field
Where my mind found me
I fear in the early morning light
That death was banished by
My reflection struggle
Like frightened birds in the silence
While i'm scared looking for
My lost memories
Black veil of the night
Still keeps me confined
When i scream and lift up
My bloody hands to the sky
To redeem has gone the dawn
But inside myself is still raging the night
[Chorus:]
I'm dancing with the devil
By moonlight
In the mask of madness
Two minutes before midnight
In the world of shades
"my soulles body
Is wandering through the night
And as a humanfaced monster
Is looking for his sacrify"
The everything - devouring, cold darkness
Is surrounding like an icy - ocean my heart
[Chorus:]
I'm dancing with the devil
By moonlight
In the mask of madness
Two minutes before midnight
In the world of shades

Slit down from the thorax, to free all,
the gas that should not be there,
the cerebrum will have not survived,
upon close examination, from the chest to the skull,
has show the movement of fluids that the surface refused,
co-injections have failed to prepare the remains,
there's much too much to be saved, decomposition has claimed,
what was an animal frame with it's organs and brain,
will be dissected and then reduced to mush,
It's not to be chopped to bring you power,
it's only to be devoured,
what is it now that you throw doubt upon,
don't ask of things you not meant to have or know,
have or know,
Pre-embalming purge, and rotting pigmentation,
extra firming fluids, and hardening compounds,
nasal aspiration.

Proud and free, that's American to me
Symptomatically and so basically
It's so definite, freedom is all of it
No humanity without restraint
Refuse to be denied, refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
It's jingoistic or nationalistic
Or whatever the hell you want to call it
With my raised fist, yeah
Never be denied
I stand and resist again
Proud and free, that's a human thing to me
Burning at the core and I go to war
Ain't gonna change my way of life
Twisted rhetoric, I won't subscribe
Refuse to be denied
Refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
Imperialistic, colonialists
Bandwagon patriot, wake up to this
With my raised fist, yeah
Never be denied
I stand and resist again
Yeah
With my raised fist, yeah
Never be denied
I stand and resist again
With my raised fist, yeah
With my raised fist, yeah
I stand and resist again
Denied, denied

Voices from the spirit world can be heard through the dark
winternights, the heartbeats of the spirit. It is the holy twelve
days of Yule. Dark shapes can be seen in the sky; riders of
death. They suddenly charge down from the clouds in wonderful
wilderness; kings and chieftains, thieves and murderers - all in
the same phalanx, drifting mysteriously through the air on spirit
horses, arriving when least expected. Black shields, furs from
bear and wolf, shining blades, open wounds and ropes still tied
around their necks; they are Wuotan's pack of warges, the undead
and the dead - the immortal warriors of Ansuzgarda! The
werewolves haunt the sacred twelve days of Yule in packs, looking
after the living; hail the sacred traditions, hail the spirits of
the dead, hail the holy ritual of Wuotan, or face the wrath of
the Ansuz and the hooves of Sleipnir. Face the Ansuzgardaraiwo!

Jen you're stuck into my world now
And you're one of god's most precious pearls now
And your blue eyes show a new dimension
That this world has got a new extension
You came to me in days of sadness
There is no young there is no old
You took me into your world of madness
Now twice I don't have to be told
Jen honestly I say I love you
Hair, that has the colour of chestnut, that
presence I admire you
Happy is your world wide religion
You can't hurt nobody, at least with no intention
We are just smiling at each other
Honey you must be from above
And those in sadness we will bother
We sold our souls for love
To everybody
And when you meet her
Then say hello for me
The sweetest child of mine

Hark. For I speak of purity.
I am unconquerable. In my worship.
I am invincible on my crusade.
However hard the strikes may be.
However deep the wounds.
This blood immortal, bleeds for thee.
In every breath I hear the silent whisper of your name.
In every harmony, In every thought.
You make my water into wine.
Remember, I am ever thine.
Blessed was I with the consecration.
To indomitable dedication.
Two bound as one. In a trinity.
Where I comprise infinite forms of unity.
In unity reborn to a state.
Where all past burdens no longer shall be worn.
I pledge to perfection.
No compromise can touch my woe.
Nor questions reach my faith, in immortality.
In the name of Nonus Aequilibrium.
I am thine. IX times IX...

These memories they fade quick with every breath
I realize with you gone. I can feel whole. Was forced to bow
but my face will kiss the ground. never again
raped of my everything. I was place in a mold. since my inception
that I had to set a flame with a trembling hand and eyes ready to burst with tears
I commit an act of beauty and walk away from everything
that I had ever been taught and with putting faith in myself
I was given a gift and a chance at life to be mine
These memories they fade quick with every breath
I realize with you gone. I can feel whole
was forced to bow but my face will kiss the ground. never again
so I now stand apart. I look into his empty eyes
a life wasted. caught up on something. he could never even see
he now awaits the embrace of death. waiting for his beloved maker
an angle appears. dressed in fire and whispers it was all a lie

Puppet king, oh puppet king
When you sleep do you dream of control?
Everything, run by strings
Your shadow has a voice of its own
Puppet king, oh, puppet king
Have your subjects found out that you're dead?
Whispers sing in the wind
The puppet mob has come for your head
Puppet show
Puppet show
Puppet king, oh puppet king
The end is near
The curtains comes down
Hear them sing, dance and drink
A puppet king without a puppet crown
Puppet show
Puppet show
All the children sing
Of a crownless king
When the children sing
Then you will know
The puppet show
Puppet show
Puppet show

Forsaking every other thing
Leaving uncertainties behind
From the loneliness and the dark
I came into your light
No more sadness surrounding me
My heart is beating it's last beat
As I am breathing my last breath
For what I could not live without
Has gone and will not come again
Sadness surrounding me

I believe in the secret path that's hiding from
Our eyes,the night-time skies
Are weaving a web of haze
Golden shores are so far away from silver dreams
Arcades cast platinum shades
Way back to the early days
Here
The stardust angel spreads his wings and rides the winds of time
Touched by the moonlight's sonant symphony
Color my sky
Forsaken am I
From out of the shadows
There's a light to rely
Unbrocken wings
The rising of kings
To a new age we're waiting
For the dawning of springs
I believe in calling spirits of the trees
Per chance, we're staying in trance
We summon the coming age
Listening to the tunes of whales and dolphins here
Our seams, mistreated and squeezed
Will turn into furious rage
Here
The stardust angel spreads his wings and rides the winds of time
Touched by the moonlight's sonant symphony
Color my sky
Forsaken am I
From out of the shadows
There's a light to rely
Unbrocken wings
The rising of kings
To a new age we're waiting
For the dawning of springs
Color my sky
Forsaken am I
From out of the shadows
There's a light to rely
Color my sky
Forsaken am I
From out of the shadows
There's a light to rely
Unbrocken wings
The rising of kings
To a new age we're waiting
For the dawning of springs

Hidden from reality escape is minimal thinking without knowing close the fist of life no changes for life product of an environment unchanged all time is over property of the industry no mind of your own we're all the same all just links in the chain consume or be consumed blindly walk their path closed eyes of trust our demise big business selling industrialized addiction and death you think these death agents are made for your enjoyment think again you're just a pawn in the big corporate machine a tool to keep the poor in their place

I see all
I hear all
Build it from nothing
Let fringed wings free
Come soar with me
We build mountains to crush oceans
You're in danger from our creations
Can you? Will you? Build you?

Victory we fought hard and prevailed
Brutally we were fighting
Stormy seas rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield lit by lightning
Eagerly we filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily ravens cawing
Home shore calls
We return on bloody seas
Twilight falls
Darkness crawling
So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends
No regrets we went out to war and strife
To protect king and country
Victory honor those who gave their life
Willingly we will not grieve
So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will drink tonight
(Oh oh oh)
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink tonight
Raise your horns raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet in Valhalla again

Faceless, subhuman
Shattered souls I feed
Experimenting
Dead eyes watching me
Bow down
Sheep to the slaughter
Bow down
Follow the creator
Into the path of the unknown
Where they must walk alone
The unholy are lifeless
Sunken eyes dripping back
The secrets of the dead
Hopeless, disgusting
Pathetic human beings
Annihilation
Of what you believe
Now you will Bow down
Sheep to the slaughter
Bow down
Follow the creator
Into the path of the unknown
Where they must walk alone
The unholy are lifeless
Sunken eyes dripping back
The secrets of the dead
Secrets of the dead
Take control of my everything
Killing them systematically
My power is growing
Their blood is flowing
The unholy are lifeless
Sunken eyes dripping back
The secrets of the dead
They keep calling me back

Peaceful they lived
In a world without war
Everything seemed to be clear
Riders approaching
Raming all down
Bringing them sadness and tears
Nothing was left
And all was gone
So they had to start their war
Ages of glory
So tells the story
They couldn't win
Because thet were born to loose
Kingdom of madness
Filled with their sadness
They were (the) chosen
To give their life away
Nobody argued
Nobody talked
They had their weapons to speak
Fields stained with blood
The battle was done
And the tears just melt in the sand
They lit a light
Fot those who had gone
They all knew
It was sad but true
[Solo]
[Chorus]

In the holy river Ganges
In the river of karma and souls
Shiva speaks to the Goddes Kali
Gentle breezes carry his voice
In the holy river Ganges
Pilgrims wash away their sins
And the water kisses their bodies
Like the priestess of your dreams
At the Sati Ritual fires burn and burn
Flames will quickly take you down
You will drwon in flames
In the sacred river Ganges
In the river of spirits and blood
Shiva speaks to the Goddes Kali
Kali will respect no god
On the hill there is a graveyard
Where the fire people lie
Those who cannot ever be there
To the river are sacrificed
At the Sati ritual fires burn and burn
Ganges endless waves still flow
But the ashes change
In the blessed river Ganges
There are many skulls and bones
Shiva speaks to the Godded Kali
Kali wants to kill us all
No more room for Kama Sutra
If you wish to stay alive
You are waiting for a new star
Maybe in another time
Take a dive into the waters
Swim and search the gate inside
You may find a lot of wonders
You may break it open wide

late night at penn state, we exit from the bar
stagger up the stairs, and wish we had a car
cause it's a long walk home and pretty fucking cold
we chat with skins we meet, about the days of old
and bands from skating days, gbh and tedencies
black flag and kennedeys, and everything inbetween
into a crash course of just skins enjoy,
they hollered loud and proud
oi! oi! oi! oi!
so raise your fist in skin head bliss
so raise your fist to a way of life
we start our voyage home out in the bitter cold
and in a drunken state we travel up the road
slowly step by step we drag our drunken guide
up pulls the rhino yelling, "hey would you like a ride?"
oi! oi! to the albino rhino
oi! oi! friends we made
oi! oi! to the albino rhino
so raise your fists like this
in joyous skinhead bliss
so raise your fists like this
raise your fist now just like this
we reached our place at last and chattered over beers
and listened to stories of a skinhead pioneer
then said good bye and it was nearly dawn
i thanked them for the rideand they traveled on
if you're ever at penn state and exit from a bar
and stagger up the stairs and wish you had a car
and walking in the cold is what you don't enjoy
look for the rhino van and holler oi! oi! oi!

I declare, that we're all just shit
And I believe, we'll die like it
I could try, to still remain
And realize, Anything is Mine, Anything is mine

Greed, it's really no mystery
Where these people come from
Is so fucking plain to see
They fist-fuck the planet and smile
And lick their fingers clean
Hey, you're better than all the rest
You're God's special creature
Intelligence at it's best
You fist-suck the planet in style
And lick your fingers clean
But now you wake up in a pile of shit
Gone is the dream
And you scream but there's no one there
You got to pay your own fare
Your dick is sore and you're all alone
Hurts like hell when it hits home
Now, listen
Prepare to suck cock in hell
It's really not all that bad
Once you get past the smell
You fist-fucked the planet and smiled
And licked your fingers clean
As Gods come and go
You did not make the winning team
So you scream but there's no one there
You got to pay your own fare
Your dick is sore and you're all alone
Hurts like hell when it hits home
When it hits home
You're God's special little creature

So it begins
And I am surrounded by my enemies
Darkness seems like my closest friend
Suffering and waiting for you
Each breath feels like my last
But that won't stop me
I've seen the way it finds
I won't give up
Carry on 'til then
And though I'm incapable of sustaining
Myself even for a moment
I will outlive time, carry on

I watched you die as you left this world behind
Free from this filthy grave, free from this world of pain
What do you feel, when your last breath is real?
Creature of the night
Your beauty humbles my existence
I felt the pain inside...
As I looked into your eyes
Death consumed them as they glistened
A reminder, this is all we are...
Just flesh and bone
This is who we are...
Just shackled bones...
Called to the unknown
Forced to walk this path, with no way to turn back.
There's no second chance....
Born into a world, a fallen world of our ancient fathers
Your innocence is as pure as the air that escapes your lungs final breath tonight.
It's poetic
Like the glow of a midnight moon
Agony, but I am here!
Suffering, but beast, I am near!

It's all a dream
A spider's web
You're a number
Symbiosis
Symbiosis
The rhythm contorts
Stretches
Manipulates
It waits for an answer that never existed
Never existed
Never existed
Never existed
Never existed
We dream in blood and circuits
We dream in blood and circuits
Find me because I'm there
Find me because I'm there
You are all the abstract
You are nothing
Both the same
You are the new clear
You are the essence of our earth
And now I summon your spirit
Please God
I cherish my life
Our dreams are the only thing we have when things are down
Your courage to show the fool the world will clear the path
Find me because I'm there
Find me because I'm there
You are the new clear
You are the essence of our earth
And now I summon your spirit
Please God
I cherish my life
You're a clone of disaster
The edge of chaos
The beginning of life
The end of death
Pleased to meet you
My name is soul
Repeat after me
My name is soul
Soul
In dark spaces unknown to man
A mystical power lies within your hand
Find me because I'm there
Yeah
The paradox is heaven in our bones
The victors' book is lost
Solo: Doc
The paradox is heaven in our bones
The victors' book is...
Find me because I'm there
Yeah
Find me because I'm there
Yeah

The time had come to make the ultimate sacrifice, the bitter cup would not be removed.
Through betrayaland denial you never said a word.
As the flesh was ripped from your back, you never said a word.
As you walked to your execution you saw a man at his worst.
Your silence spoke volumes and your path was unshaken.
Thorns embedded in flesh, sweat burning open wounds.
Tortured by the ones you were dying for.
Hammer to white.
With dying breath, asking forgiveness for our murders.
All this for a world of imperfection and sin.
All for a world who would deny your existence.
A world that could never deserve grace and mercy.
But yours abounds, unending love for an unworthy world.
