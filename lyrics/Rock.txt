We see life through the same lens
That's what you said to me
And I knew that it was true
Until you threw my heart in the sea
How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real
If it's life on the defense
The stinging pain of being made to fool
All the cynics and the irony
Won't save you when you're drowning
In loves' sweet pool
How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real
Baby, baby
It's only fair that you tell me
Just what it was you think I did wrong
If I was looking through the same lens
My prescription must of been all wrong
How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to fell
How do I act like we never kissed
When everything is saying it was oh so real
If we saw through the same lens
Then you'd see I want you here right now
Instead of waiting for the day
When memory has clouded
Everything we loved about it
How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real
How do you adjust your vision
How do you pretend not to care
How do I act like we never met
And that you didn't see
What we know was there baby
Baby

My gears they grind
More each day
And I feel like
They're gonna grind away
And the city blocks
They drive me wild
The never ending
Mile after mile
I just don't know what to do
I'm too afraid to love you
It's heaven on earth
It's in her embrace
Her gentle touch
Her smiling face
I'm just one wishing
That I was a pair
With someone
Oh, somewhere
I just don't know what to do
I'm too afraid to love you
All those sleepless nights
And all those wasted days
I wish loneliness would leave me
But I think it's here to stay
What more can I do?
'Cause I'm wringing myself dry
And I can't afford to lose
One more tear drop from my eyes
I'm too afraid
I'm too afraid
I just don't know what to do
With myself
Thinking all the time
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Driving me out of my mind

First thing I remember was asking papa, why,
For there were many things I didn't know.
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,
Saying, someday you'll understand.
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes.
Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust.
For there were many things I didn't know.
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,
And someday you'll understand.
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes.
And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,
For there were many things I didn't know.
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,
Sayin' someday you'll understand.
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes.
Think it was September, the year I went away,
For there were many things I didn't know.
And still I see him standing, tryin' to be a man,
I said, someday you'll understand.
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes.

They had the righteous stuff
They were really quite daring/arrogant
In their magnificent flying machines
They were the chosen few
They loved God and the flag
They had hair-cuts you could set your watch by
All hail to Monkey '61, all hail to Monkey '61
He was the first one in space
Just like Henry The Cat
Was the first to wear Channel No.5
They taught two-two song
They taught him right from wrong
With their sweet nuzzles and electric shocks
So all hail to Monkey '61, all hail to Monkey '61
Where was his ticker tape parade? For Monkey '61
Where was his lunch with Jackie O?

Turning in to something
Drifting off to always
Got to pull myself back in
Holding back the questions
Bruised with all rejections
Got to pull myself back in
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around
Come back around
I miss you around
Reaching out for someone
Burning out for solo
Got to pull myself back in
There's no new religion
And there's no real solution
Got to pull myself back in
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around
Come back around
Come back around
Feel you're going under
So keep on treading water
Got to pull myself back in
Feel no obligation
No more indecision
Got to pull myself back in
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
I know that you may take a while
To come back around

[Chorus]
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door.
I don't want no god on my lawn
Just a flower I can help along
'Cause the soul of no body knows
How a flower grows
Oh how a flower grows.
[Chorus]
Mary dropped her pants by the sand
And let a parson come and take her hand
But the soul of no body knows
Where the parson goes, where does the parson go?
[Chorus]
Addition verse performed in live version of this song.
Raise your mind up and look around
You can see them, yes they're looking down
From a lonely asteroid, in a vacant void.
Dyin', but not destroyed.

Oooooh, eeh!
Oooooh, eeh, oooh!
Ooooh, eh!
So we left La Mancha,
Headed out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza
Looking for adventure,
Rosinante at the reigns,
To the windmills answer,
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be loney ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again.
I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain
So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain
Said : "He's not too clever"
When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Make one better . Hey!
So tell that princess
Tell that princess right down the train
Tell that princess : She'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain
Ooooh, eh!
Oooooh, eh, oo-oh....
Oooooh eh
I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain...

She's one of a kind
Sometimes hard to find
Like a rainbow
Well, she's lost all her glory
And could tell you some stories
That we all should know
And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns 'round
Her beauty all aflight
It always seems to turn the tide
At midnight
And for her there is no rest
We are doing what is best
For our future
One of these days she may not
Be so good to you
One of these days she might
Shake you to the ground
But her fire is still burning
And her heart is still yearning to be found
Too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
Still you won't hear a sound as
She turns 'round
Too many hands
Too many hands

The average guy who lives next door
Who's never been in love before
That was your story in a nutshell
Kind of cute and kind of shy
The normal kind of average guy
Nobody seemed to know you that well
And all my life I've been next door
I never saw your face before
But opposites attract
And now that I found you
There's no way around you
No way at all
And now that I, now that I found you
There's no way around you, no way
And all my life I've been next door
I never saw your face before

Take another chance now
I took mine
You got something to think about
I don't have the time
You left me hanging there
Out on the line
You got all those other things
I just got this one thing
Thanks a lot
Way to go
Bro
Thanks a lot
Way to go
Bro
Now that I've said this
Which I'll probably regret
Now that I've thrown this in your face
Do I have a case
You left me out nowhere
I'm out of time
You got all those other things
I've just got this one thing
Thanks a lot
Way to go
Bro
Thanks a lot
Way to go
Bro
Thanks a lot
Way to go
Bro
Thanks a lot
Way to go
Bro
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot, bro
Thanks a lot, bro
Thanks a lot, bro
Thanks a lot, bro

God bless
Resist
Calm down
Contact
Reach us
Go wild
I'll taste your name (I'll tell)
I'll take off these things (watch this)
Calm down
Teach us
The roads
Your contact, it keeps us provoked
Remove your veils
Every last one
I'm on your team
Let's go
Face to face (not scared)
My custom made (nightmares)
Armed with teeth (in fashion)
Now all we need (is a nice shot)
God bless
Resist
Come down
Our contact
Reach us
Go wild
Remove your veils
Every last one
I'm on your team
I'll be in it too
Rockets take you all
To tonight
It's time
Take me
(i don't care where)
Take me

You're amazing but You're taking too much time
I've only got six candles left
And I'm trying to keep this off my mind
It's getting darker but it's the way they make me feel
They try to fill my head with questions
They all doubt You but I know that You are real
If it takes time then I'll be patient
Know that I will still believe
I'll take Your hand and hold it tightly
'Cause I know You'll carry me
Take me whole, take me in, take these last six candles
And when I'm tired and warin' thin
Give me the strength to carry on
Here I am, see my hands, take these last six candles
We're movin' on, we'll keep, keep movin' on
And I'm so thankful for every breath I take
There's not a moment that goes by
I waste wipin' tears out of my cryin' face
Don't look so sad, You've missed the point
I'm still so glad I knew You, against the odds
I'll take my chances and burn this candle through You
If it takes time then I'll be patient
Know that I will still believe
I'll take Your hand and hold it tightly
'Cause I know You'll carry me
Take me whole, take me in, take these last six candles
And when I'm tired and warin' thin
Give me the strength to carry on
Here I am, see my hands, take these last six candles
We're movin' on, we'll keep, keep movin' on
If I could ever see the way You understand me
When no one else can see it, I know You so own me
I'll be the one who listens only when You tell me
Not walking, but running, not talking yeah, yeah
And they might not ever understand why I do what I do
But I can only speak my mind and what I feel is true
I'll take a vow to be the only one to stand if it takes
All that I am, I will be standing there, there
Take me whole, take me in, take these last six candles
And when I'm tired and warin' thin
Give me the strength to carry on
Here I am, see my hands, take these last six candles
We're movin' on, we'll keep, keep movin' on
Take me whole, take me in, take these last six candles
And when I'm tired and warin' thin
Give me the strength to carry on
Here I am, see my hands, take these last six candles
We're movin' on, we'll keep, keep movin' on

My blood moves
I feel all right
My ritual followed us to paradise
My blood moves
I feel all right
Don't touch me
'Cause I've had too much to feel tonight
I'm a martyr of a new and magic kind
It's gettin' easy not to suffer all the time
My good time
I feel all right
My ritual followed us to paradise
My blood moves I feel all right
Don't touch me 'cause you're still too much to feel tonight
Not tonight, I repeat, me over
I'm a martyr of a new and magic kind
It's getting easy not to suffer all the time
My sense of humor might have narrowed with my age
But happy anarchy is all I really crave
Trying to be good, while I get my fill
Will I get what I need?
I don't know if I will
When I take it in , will I make it my own again
My own again
My good time, I feel all right
My ritual got my through another night
I'm a martyr of a new and magic kind
It's getting easy not to suffer all the time
My sense of humor might have narrowed with my age
But happy anarchy is all I really crave
It's all I want. It's all I need
So come over

( Miles Hunt )
It was warm when we met
She said 'boy you'd regret it
Should you ever leave my side'
It was cold when I split
My heart had turned to shit
And I was having 'that' trouble with my mind
I said 'girl I'll call you tomorrow'
She said 'yeah, you & Benecio del Toro'
But you're such a lucky girl
To have been a part of my sick world
And I leave with no sickness or sorrow
But ooohhh if I ever missed a beat it was yours
ooohhh if I ever missed a beat it was yours
You're four to the floor
Well I thought if I stayed then
We'd both get waylaid
And our hearts & hopes would swallow us whole
Yeah they may mock & joke
But they could never call us nervous folk
Not for the way we chose go on
Cos girl we could beg, steal & borrow
And drink like our legs have gone hollow
And I'm such a lucky man
To've been the one to understand
I leave with no sickness or sorrow

I can't go with you
And I can't let you go
You can't be with me
So I won't let it show
I don't want you to know
So I'll just have to let you go
I'm going to love you so much better
You'll forget the error of my ways
I'm sending you the good I wished I'd given you
Oh how I miss you Rae
Some day you might well laugh at this
As memories of love all shift and time slips away
So don't cry honey
You can't see everything
But the wind still dries your tears
And the sun will keep you living
I just want you to see
My love's unseen but still keeps seeking
I'm going to love you so much better
You'll forget the error of my ways
I'm sending you the good I wished I'd given you
Oh how I miss you Rae
Some day you might well laugh at this
As memories of love all shift and time slips away

Things will never be the same now that you've got that shitty name
She can't even go to school until she thinks to kill is cool
Everyone hates Christina Bin Laden
Everyday she lives in sin surrounded by Americans
Why can't they just let her be like open fucking sesame
Everyone hates Christina Bin Laden

Why Don't We Hear
Why Don't We See
Is There No Future For You And Me
Why Do We Hide Behind A Masque
Suddenly Breathless
All Is Black And Blinding Me
Truth Is A Lie And Lies Are True
What Is Weak Is Sometimes Strong
Sending A Message To All
Sending A Message To God
We Must Bring Light To The Darkness
In Time We Will Rise Above
Heal The Waters
Earth Is The Lamb To The Slaughter
And Give Us Magic
Release Our Devoted Souls
Look Behind You
You've Seen The Kingdoms Fall
Subliminal Wars Make Us Cry For Sundown
Holy Man Wash The Blood From Your Hand
Godless Behavior Throughout The Land
I Fear You - You Fear Me
Building Our Bridges Eternaly
Gates Of Hell Cast Their Spell
Your Mark And Your Colors Are Branded On You
Sending A Message To All
Sending A Message To God
We Must Bring Light To The Darkness
In Time We Will Rise Above
Heal The Waters
Earth Is The Lamb To The Slaughter
And Give Us Magic
Release Our Devoted Souls
Angel Wings Burned To Ashes
Scattered Through The Sky
The Smell Of Cinder And Melting Steel
This Wound Will Never Heal
Sending A Message - A Message To All
Sending A Message To God
Heal The Waters
Earth Is The Lamb To The Slaughter
And Give Us Magic
Release Our Souls.

Push it out [repeated approx 70 times]
I wanna beat ya wanna hug ya wanna hold ya to me
Gone to hell thats where I'll be
I'll be fine then come with me
With a double shot of power and he's over me

Stand in line like military time
Flowers blooming up from dirt
Wear the ties and complicated lines
There's wrinkles on a fresh-pressed shirt
He stands alone, conforming on his own
He's thinking but he does not speak
He tries to fight the edges on his mind
But she is what he truly seeks, but she is what he truly seeks
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm reaching out
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm coming down
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out
The heat does rise, preform in double time
The sweat is falling from his brow
He's near his prize, but she begins to fly
He knows that he must act, the time is now
A dance they play, an ancient lover's game
Averts his eyes and chooses not to stare
The trick, he sees, is aiming not to please
Pretending that he doesn't really care
If you want her, then pretend that you don't care
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm reaching out
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm coming down
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out.
We're trapped inside this star
And we have gone too far
All we want is to escape, escape, escape
Hey, is there anybody out there?
So shout it out
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm reaching out
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm coming down
Hey, is anybody out there?
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out

And speaking of
Little Miss Catherine
I feel swell, oh well
Because losing you
Was something I always...
Did so well
I guess I just can't tell anymore
And the feeling I get when I see your clothes
Spread out on my floor
Oh, I'm such a bore, I'm such a bore
I don't do anything anymore
I just count these ceiling tiles falling through my floor
Sorry, I really lost my head
I'm sorry, I really lost my head
But you know those words that you said
They get stuck here in my head
And this feeling I dread, it makes me wish I was dead
Or just alone instead, I'll be alone instead
I don't need anyone in my bed
Just these ceiling tiles falling through my head
Sorry, I really lost my head
Oh, I'm so sorry, I really lost my head
Oh, those words you said

Well I had a job, but I got laid off
I had a heart but it got too soft
I had a girlfriend and she lied
I had a wife but my wife she died
One too many drinks about an hour ago
All I want now's just one more
And when it hit, a baby I don't care
Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where
Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from
Some folks they say there's just one thing (where is the next one comin' from)
Gonna make 'em dance and gonna make 'em sing (where is the next one comin' from)
Had a little o that and had a little of this (where is the next one comin' from)
Well I checked 'em all off 'a my list (where is the next one comin' from)
All I know is don't get enough
All I get is this old rough stuff
But when I do oh baby, I don't care
Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where
Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from
I want more, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Oh yeah I want more, oh oh yeah
(where is the one comin' from)
(where is the one comin' from)
(where is the one comin' from)
All I want is my belly full (where is the next one comin' from)
It's a natural thing for an animal (where is the next one comin' from)
Well I'm tired all of that give and take (where is the next one comin' from)
About all I got was a bellyache
And once a kid has come to town
He talked like a fool and he dressed like a clown
Only love could have put him down
Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where
Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from
Where Oh, where huh (where is the next one comin' from)
Got to know , got to know, got to know, got to know about the next one, yeah
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)

And they fell from the skies with the greatest of ease
And they landed on the ground under tents and trapeze
And they were told that they fell with such beauty and grace
That the Flying Wallendas would be the name on their case
And the fine folks of Akron would forever be saying
That they flew through the air like the wings of a prayer
But they all walked away amidst the gawking and stares
And the children revisited their fall in nightmares
But they never would stop and they never surrendered
And they lived like they died, the Flying Wallendas
They could dance on the wire through the fire and the storm
John Ringling had seen Karl in Cuba perform
He raised up his kids for performance and stardom
They performed center ring at Madison Square Garden
With a seven-man pyramid folks lined up just to see 'em
Till they fell from the sky at Detroit's State Fair Coliseum
And they fell to the ground with the greatest of ease
Three didn't get up from the blood in the breeze
But Karl wouldn't be stopped from his home in the skies
Till he fell from the wire in San Juan and he died

So a man and a woman forked at a baby
The prince of dysfunction boy on a string
From a suburban palace he walked out to freedom
Enslaved to a concept in the world of a king
And baby's love he's smoking in a peacoat
A ship on the ocean bird on a wind
With a poem and soul written in his honor
There's a concrete assumption in the world of a king
A guitar and a girlfriend, just off the turnpike
Yeah, the fountain of ego learned how to sing
But the truth shall engage him with heartbreak and cold cots
In an unguarded moment in the world of a king
And baby's gone, she's dancing on a big stage
With a tear and a tutu
The phone never rings
And he can't go on, he's banging on a keyboard
There's an E-mail to Jesus from the world of a king

Gun gun who sold the gun?
You had to take em all with you
I guess you might have meant to live
But after all the mess you realize
You're just another lonely kid
With a fucked up little endgame
From some video arcade
And a semi-automatic
From the man down the street
There's a candy store in heaven
Selling out of every pleasure
And a higher hall of learning
Filled with kids forever yearning
And a rock show for all ages
Bands a playing "rock of ages"
Well I guess we made you famous
Cause we're just as fucked up yeah
We got our name on every toe-tag
Of everything that is good
Yeah we got bombs by the busload
In every corner of the world
So many messes we can't clean up
Wars for every boy and girl
There's a candy store in heaven
Selling out of every pleasure
And a higher hall of learning
Filled with kids forever yearning
And a rock show for all ages
Bands a playing "rock of ages"
Bombs blowing over Baghdad
On the day that you were born
A marketplace of bodies
To share our cemetery songs
Three hundred thousand children
Marching off to wars
Funded by our government
For their dirty warlords
See you're just one in a long line
You're not so lonely after all
And I guess we made you famous
Cause we're just as fucked up yeah

Past the billboards and the magazines
I dream about being with you
We can't hear a word they say
Let's pretend we own the world today
I know it's cold outside
But when we're together I got nothing to hide
Hold on tight I will never let you down
It can't rain on our side of town
Wipe the sweat from my hair
Tell me we're not better off
Wipe the tears from my face
The sunnyside of the street where we are

It's hard to believe all this bullshit is
Just another way to unjustice this and
Make a smile, turn around, you don't know what I want you to tell me
And if this is a nightmare then don't wake me up,
I'm already down and you can't cheer me up
Cuz this isn't easy, it all just began
You are my bus girl
All the lights are on you,
what more in this world
All the lights are on you now
Hold our bus, girl
(All the lights are on you now)
Hold our bus, girl
I'm sick and tired of this stupidity
that I'm fascinated of people's sensuality
But i'm not crazy at all
It's getting late and I'm way too pissed to smile
Been on too long, I'm off in a while
The road is dark but enlighted by the stars.
You are my bus girl
All the lights are on you,
what more in this world
All the lights are on you now
Hold our bus, girl
(All the lights are on you now)
Hold our bus, girl
And now I'm waiting for this bless
The second that you turn around
And it's impossible to know
Whenever I will hit the ground
Standin' looking over you
It's like you've never seen, anything before
No, anything before me
You are my bus girl
All the lights are on you,
what more in this world
All the lights are on you now
Hold our bus, girl
(All the lights are on you now)
Hold our bus, girl
All the lights are on you now.

People at the city say he's buried underground
They're turning over the stones
But there's nothing here to be found
Looking to the desert in a cool moonlight
Nobody watching, there is no one out tonight
Standing in the shadows there's a real mean guy
And I don't know if I'll make it
And I don't know if I'm gonna die tonight
Take a caravan to the limit of the city
Smoke the hookah pipes
Where the people have no pity
Ptolemy
The dogs will howl in the market square
You'll bargain for your life
But you leave their treasures there
Don't you go astray on the wrong side of the city
Fighting for your life
Where the people have no pity
Ptolemy
(Solo)
I wish I'd never listened
To that old high priest
He told me of the riches
They buried beneath
Down in the crypt where the men fear to tread
She danced the seven veils and the boy was nearly dead
Don't you go astray on the wrong side of the city
Fighting for your life
Where the people have no pity
Ptolemy
Ptolemy
Ptolemy
Ptolemy
Ptolemy
Ptolemy
Ptolemy
Ptolemy

I may not be your way back in the blues
But the blues is back in me
I may not be the same as you
But I'm the same as I can be
I may not walk the way I talk
But I get there just the same
Lord, I mean I play the same as you
Yet I don't play the game
I may not be the sound of blues
But I can live that sound
I may not be around the world
But I can make the world be round, yeah
I can't dig the sound of blues
I can't dig the sound
I can't make the world be round
Make the world be round

A thousand miles dear a thousand more across the water across the shore
I'll say a prayer for yours and mine please think of me dear each night at nine
I hold your picture close to my heart it takes your place dear while we're apart
It helps remind me that you're still mine please think of me dear each night at nine
The bugle's blowing out go the lights uh but it's lonesome these army nights
Tell all our friends I'm doing fine please think of me dear each night at nine
Please think of me dear each night at nine

Methadonia
They weeble and they wobble
But they don't fall down
You see the fed has got their back
And they say, it's better than crack
Plus it keeps them mellow and passive
And takes them to the land
The land of Methadonia
There are three around my way
And all day I see them straying
Up the block and down the stairs
Comin' in groups but leaving in pairs
Like suckers with their weeks supply
Your eye and I see you selling the elixir of life
And takes them to the land
The land of Methadonia
And takes them to the land
The land of Methadonia
I see you hangin' on my stoop
You better swoop before I do
Some jammies in your eye
Because the place in which you're sent
By your liquid orange friend
Has kept you from it for so long
And takes them to the land
The land of Methadonia
And takes them to the land
The land of Methadonia
And takes them all fucking to the land
The land of Methadonia

Saturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear, clear and blue
But Saturday sun, it came without warning
So no one knew what to do
And saturday sun brought people and places
That didn't see much in their day
And when I remember these people, these people and places
They were really, really too good in their way, in their way
And saturday sun won't come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through, through your brain
Just think about, think about people
In their season, season and times
Just returning again and again
So Sunday sat in Saturday sun
And wait for a day gone by

I can see a time when I won't be able to feel the time no more,
and I can leave this town for other shores.
'cause I could never make it last or ever understand
what you'd keep me for when I turn evil in your hands.
Saying all they have is drawn from memory,
I've got you and tomorrow.
You can steal the scene but you're blind
and the magic will leave you feeling hollow.
The girl that I could never hurt had to go and lose all that power over me,
and I claimed victory.
Saying all they have is drawn from memory, I've got you and tomorrow.
You can steal the scene bit you're blind and the magic will leave you feeling hollow.

Seeing it from the other side
Who's laughing now?
Turned out all your games were worthless
My head is still intact, I'm on top now
How can you still deny
You know i've seen it with my very eyes
Count me out of your life, as i kick you out of mine
Let me take this knife that you stuck in my back
and wave it in front of your face
Right before i shove it in your throat
You look nicely
Laying in my closet, underneath my clothes
Holy shit I just woke up
Was it a dream?
No, you're still there!

Billie Holiday on the radio,
My sluggish heart is beating seven beats too slow. Another sad song and another shot of blue,
Cold and unconcerned are anything but new.
He said Love endures all things,
and it hurts to think He's right.
If I mark the span of failure is his burden just as light?
Chorus: I am Spartan, close my heart so tight.
Jesus, save me from myself tonight.
Limping through the world, there's a knowing look or two.
Is it just the cripples here who understand the truth?
Why is love so painful, why do we always lose?
Paving pathways for the lost, the bitter and recluse?
He said Love endures all things,
and it hurts to think its true.
Did it nail Him on a cross, did it crucify Him too?
The angels are singing over the plains,
the shepherds are quaking, echoing refrains
And all of our slogans designed to take away the pain meant nothing to the Son of God that night in Bethlehem.

WALKING AWAY FROM ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW I FIND IT SO HARD
TO TURN MY BACK BUT I MUST PUT MY FOOT DOWN STICK TO MY OWN
GUNS SO MY DEAR FRIEND BE THERE FOR ME I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU BE THERE FOR WE
MUST GET WHAT I NEED I'VE GOT NO MONEY
MUST GET WHAT I NEED I'VE GOT NO MONEY
MUST GET WHAT I NEED I'VE GOT NO MONEY
AND JUST TO GET IT I WOULD WALK RIGHT OVER YOU
WALKING AWAWY I HEARD A RUMOUR SPOKEN
SAID I'M SHAKEN UP FROM A DREAM BUT I SAY NO IT'S
NOT TRUE MY HEAD IS CLEARER
THE SUN WILL GO DOWN AGAIN SO SOON THERE'S NO
TIME TO LOSE AGAIN I'LL SAY

Way down here on the edge of these snows
I hear a strong wind whine
Goin' to where the freedom bells ring
Into the Highlands I must climb
On this journey, I have been here before
Tryin' to reach the other side
I just can't get through the top of these hills
Without a mountain guide
Took such a while to find you
Oh, could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons
Up ahead, I know the trail way stops
From there on, only eagles fly
Burning with visions of the way back to you
They're burnin' through the eastern sky
Now and then I see a shooting star
Lighting up the silver blue
It's shining all the way down the mountain skyway
Oh, it's shining straight from you
Took all my life to find you
Oh, could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons
Up ahead, took all my life to find you
Oh could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew, you're the only one
So take me through High Landrons, up ahead

They're always stealing off the land
The Earl has to make his final stand
Build a device to catch them all
I don't give a damn if they say they're poop
Chorus
If you get caught there's no going back
It's a man trap
The jaws of his baby tightly snap
It's a man trap
He's old and mean and he hates the world
He's wicked as sin, his mind is narled
He's got plenty but he doesn't share
And to ask for help they wouldn't dare
A wall heath man with wife to keep
Did his duty and stole a sheep
Refused to grovel he refused to beg
Stepped on the trigger and lost his leg
Deported abroad and is long since dead
The gamekeeper's found without his head
His body was torn like tissue paper
a hidden peg-leg found years later

Go go
A-go go
A-go go
Go go go
Start the day for something
Start the day at seven ten
Waking for a living
And the pattern starts again
It's avenue b, change at Tennessee
Before the city begins to swell
At seven two four on the second floor
Is where the telephone has my bell
Echo echo echo down the wire
I can see
I can see
Nothing else to be
I can see
I can see
Nothing else to be
Only seven letters
Only seven hours to go
I begin to wonder now
If there's still a place below
I file it away, handing in the tray
So I can only be who I am
Eleven fifteen, tapping the machine
Until the calender starts to jam
Echo echo echo down the wire
I can see
I can see
Nothing else to be
I can see
I can see
Nothing else to be
Oh talking about
Oh walking about
We'll go back to the sea
And find what I'm about
Oh
But I'll never be someone again
Oh
'cause it happens all over again tomorrow
Hit it
Get it
Make it
Shake it
Hit it
Get it
Make it
Shake it

1:15 began with a phone ring
i heard i stirred but I wasn't hurt
tonight's lines are yours to keep
go back to sleep
and that's wonderful
when your world at it's worst seems bearable
is it no so terrible to stay
and terrible to say
why won't you change
and walk into the rain
where we love to splash and play
it will be here forever
while everyone's so convinced
theyknow everything is true
all I believe in is you
it was a wonderful puddle that I played in
and I was so young when it hit me
in no one you can believe
but that's terrible
when these evil white lies make hysterical
habit forming beautiful
I miss my friends
they live next door
but insincerity is so hard to ignore
it was a wonderful puddle that we played in
and at two and a half we hit back
isn't that wonderful
that as they gather round our grave
to splash and play they'll say
why'd you have to change
and walk into the same
where the dirty rain drains
you're gone in the morning
while everyone is so convinced
they know everything is true
all i believe in is you.

Can we understand life
And live it at the same time
Where is this purpose you speak of?
I'll be the background of this photograph
The soundtrack to this night
And we are fading out, before our eyes
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
In heaven so wonderful
Why are we oh so afraid of dying young
We are dying young
We are the patterns and the shapes
The patchwork from the window on this place
We are alone, alone, alone
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
This television set, it burns my eyes
And there is no one here
That can keep me warm tonight
Where is this purpose
Where is the lie, the lie, the lie
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night

The video game says "Play me"
Face it on a level but it takes you every time on a one on one
Feeling running down your spine
Nothing gonna save your one last dime cause it owns you
Through and through
The databank knows my number
Says I gotta pay cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kicks you round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do
Do to you
[Chorus]
Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill, and who made who? (or who picked up the glue,)(?)
Who made who, who turned the screw?
Satellites send me picture
Get it in the eye,
take it to the world (take it to the wire)
spinning like a dynamo
Feel it going round and round
Running out of chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town
So don't look down, no
[Chorus]
Ain't nobody told you, who made who?

Don't want to die in this has been town
There's too much sorrow, I fear I'll drown
Where happy hours go down the drain
Don't want to be no nameless face
Talking all about the olden days
And all my friends who made the grave
Yeah, all the ones who couldn't wait
I've got no time to waste on bottled sympathy
I've got no time to waste on drunken eulogies
Don't count me out, don't call me history
I'm not dead, don't bury me
Shut your jaded mouth
And spare your jealous teeth
I'm not dead, don't bury me
Don't want to be no clean teen dream
A green machine selling magazines
Their average lifespan is a week
Don't want to preach no politics, bow down to bullshit
Like a hypocrite, no, I don't feel no unity
No, I don't want your company
I've got no time to waste on bottled sympathy
I've got no time to waste on drunken eulogies
So don't count me out, don't call me history
I'm not dead, don't bury me
Shut your jaded mouth
And spare your jealous teeth
I'm not dead, don't bury me

It's complete but obsolete
All tomorrow's become yesterday
In demand but second hand
It's been heard before you even play
Up to date but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You're so right but overnight
You're the one who has to take the blame
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Don't delay you're in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday's star is Monday's scar
Out of date before you're even seen
At the top so quick to flop
You're so new but rotting in decay
Like butterfly so quick to die
But you're only looking for today
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Listen, glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but oh how quick it goes
Ten foot tall but what to fall
Hard to open yet so easy to close
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Over-paid, but soon you fade
Because you're only looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today

When the fists of winter fly, driving bones into the snow
Blackened frostbitten nights, vodka running dry
The statues cloaked in white and migrants from museums
Losing all the feeling now that sunrise is outlawed
Strangers plant themselves down in the cold hard ground
Later when the harvest thaws snow drops will be in bloom
Crossed out on city maps, Prospekt Mira reveals
Shadows drinking antifreeze 'neath the underpass
Ordered once a Gulag's march, now cities send the call
Falling from the rooftops fast and frozen against the wall
Where strangers plant themselves, dead souls of the underground
When February thaws snow drops will be in bloom again
Bloom again, bloom again, bloom again, bloom again
Red blooms, red blooms

Changing seasons
The train is leaving
The destination is everywhere but here
Im moving on now
Whats to find out
When everything behind me
Ive torched down to the ground
Empty highways
And broken skyways
They take us places
But dont leave us anywhere
So divided
I cant revive it
You dont know what youve got until its really gone
Steel wheels now turning
Its just me and my burden
Going out now
Out on the nothern bound
You can try to face it
But you wont never erase it
And it will follow you
No matter how far you go
So many miles in all the while
You can run until the break of dawn
You turn around there is nothing now
So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Oh and there you are
You can try to face it
But you wont never erase it
And it will follow you
No matter how far you go
So many miles in all the while
You can run until the break of dawn
You turn around there is nothing now
So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Oh and there you are

You've always got your eye out for a place that you can hang
You're always on the lookout for a group to call a gang
Because the world is such a better place when people have your back
A crew can really make up for the things in life you lack
To face the world alone, you cannot bear it
If the varsity jacket fits, then I say wear it
Because if you hear the call, then you're better of at the mall
Shopping for your wolfpack
It's like they say: Now a baby got back
Since you were young you always wished you had a cool nickname
Just like those guys in Project X you're longing for the same
You know when you have picked your crew your friends will help you out
What better way to find out just what "cool" is all about?

Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives are stuck in the undertow
But you know the places I wanna go
Cause oh oh oh I've got a sickness you've got the cure
You've got the spark I've been looking for
And I got a plan we walk out the door
You know you wanna just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
Singing oh oh oh
We got all we need singers
So here we go
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up turn it up alright
At five minutes to midnight
You'll see our name in city lights
Well make the clock stop make your heart drop
It becomes alive
We could pack up and leave other things behind
No fact or fiction or story line
Cause I need you more than just for tonight your oh oh oh
All I care I can't stop my breathing in
I'm weak and you were my medicine
I won't stop til I am under your skin
You know you wanna just let go
It's time to roll down the window
Singing oh oh oh
We got all we need so here we go
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up turn it up alright
At five minutes to midnight
And when the clock strikes twelve
Will you find another boy
To go and kiss and tell
Cause you know I never will I think we could strike a match
And hold it to the wind to
See how long it lasts
We can make the time stand still
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up turn it up alright
At five minutes to midnight
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up turn it up alright
At five minutes to midnight

Come on with me
Tell me all about it
Come on with me
Tell me all about it
Come on with me
And tell me all about it
I needed to feel you there
Oh you'll doubt it
Come on with me
Tell me all about it
Come on with me
Tell me all about it
Come on with me
And tell me all about it
I needed to feel you there
Oh you'll doubt it
Just come on with me
Tell me all about it
Come on with me
Tell me all about it
Please don't leave me not like this
What about all that we'll miss
Done it all and what a waste
I don't want this rage misplaced
Please don't leave me, not just yet
'Cause it's brutal, can't forget
Nothin' else we could have done
Still it's killin' me you're gone

Joseph took his wife and child and they went to Africa
To escape the rage of a deadly king
There along the banks of the Nile they listened to the song
That the captive children used to sing
They were singing
My Deliverer is coming
My Deliverer is standing by
Through a dry and thirsty land
Water from the Kenyan heights pours itself out of Lake Sangra's broken heart, it's broken heart
There in the Sahara winds
Moses heard the whole world cry
For the healing that would flow from God's own scars
I hear Moses singing
My Deliverer is coming
My Deliverer is standing by
He will never break his promise
He has written it upon the sky
He'll come 'round
He'll come 'round some day
(Just like He said He would)
I will never doubt his promise
Though I doubt my heart, though I doubt my eyes
My Deliverer is coming
My Deliverer is standing by
Standing by, oh He's standing by
Deliver me, deliver me

(Shel Silverstein)
There's a shadow on the sun I see it risin'
Kiss it away, kiss it away
And there's a hurt down deep inside that I been hidin'
Kiss it away, kiss it away
Now the hard times we been through
Oh babe we'd never mind them
We'd just kiss 'em away, we'd just kiss 'em away
And now I'm lookin' for the good times I can't find them
Must have kissed them away, guess we kissed them away
I keep thinkin' the sun will shine once more
I'm never ready for the sudden rain
Don't tell me I'm wrong, 'cause I've been told
I'm so wet and cold
Come kiss away my pain
You keep hopin' things'll change and I keep tryin'
One of these days, maybe one of these days
But there's a coldness in the air like somethin' dyin'
Kiss it away, kiss it away

Tonight you stoop to my level.
I'm your mangy little whore.
Now you're trying to find your underwear,
And your socks,
And then the door.
And you're trying to find a reason
Why you have to leave.
I know it's 'cause you think you're Adam
And you think I'm Eve.
And you rhapsodize about beauty
And my eyes glaze.
Everything I love is ugly,
I mean really
You would be amazed.
And just do me a favor,
It's the least that you can do.
Just um
Don't treat me like I am
Something that happened to you.
I am, I am, I am
Truly sorry,
Sorry about all this.
And you plot a tiny pin prick
In my big red balloon.
As I slowly start to exhale,
It's when you leave the room.
And I did not design this game.
I did not name the stakes.
I just happen to like apples,
And I am not afraid of snakes.
I am, I am, I am
Truly sorry about all this.
I hear you and your anger hurts
I hear that it's with, with
With
So I let go the ratio
Things set, things hurt.
As I leave you to your garden,
And the beauty you prefer.
I wonder whether this will have meaning
For you, when you've left it all behind.
I think I'll even wonder
If you meant it at the time.

There's a time only truth buys
In the early small hours of the morning
When you brushed the sleep from my eyes
And told me stories
Electricity
The day scrapes the sidewalk
Sugar turns to salt
Talk is cheap
A half-remembered glance from a dirty window
I want to take a little walk
In the cool night air and see
Which way the wind blows
There's another side to the city
A life within a life unknown
Like blood in the veins of a body it flows
Down the alley nobody knows
Checkpoint charlie
Eyes from a garbage can
Reveal the man
Is on his toes
I want to take a little walk
In the cool night air and see
Which way the wind blows
I want to take a little walk
In the cool night air and see
Which way the wind blows
She gives a sky feeling to the night
Waiting 'til you weaken for a moment
She'll buy the diamonds
If you'll buy the pearls
For the moment
Electricity
The night lights a candle
Love turns to fire
I want to take a little walk
In the cool night air and see
Which way the wind blows

Bless spirit ditties of no tone.
Inspirations. Unsensations.
Modulate more silence.
You and I may foresee.
We can be history.
Painted on wall that's near.
Ought to.
Montage fragments.
Ditties of no tone.

Clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got no dirty little fingers
Bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I"m wrong
Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
And no one ever want to' know
Love ain't funny
A crime in the wink of an eye
Your sister always singing
She play the step child
A broken little memory
Her heart was never kind
Tell me I'm blind
Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I'm wrong
Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

A story 'bout a street girl named Genius
Give herself a name thought it would bring her fame
Sang poetry and mime on the street corner line
Dancin' to a maze of passers by
[Chorus]
In her blue jeans and her painted face
She took your mind through time and space
If desire could bring you everything you wanted
She woulda' had it all a long, long time ago
In her mind she was reflecting the society we live in
That's enough to make a woman?s heart go cold
[Chorus]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
La,la,la,la,la,la
La,la,la,la,la,la
La,la,la,la,la,la
[Chorus]
It was a big night and the audience was expected
And a ******* as she took the stage
And as she began to weave her magic
It was spellbound and under up in a ****
[Chorus]

As you watch from your house on the hill
World keeps spinning around you you're standing still
And a thought rivers enters your mind
Something happened once in my life
A fading picture of you that's so hard to describe
I've been where the sun never shines
That's alright there's a change in the story
That's alright there's a change in the plan
A twist in the tale
Face in the mirror head in the clouds
Hanging on to a dream that you can't do without
As it drops like a stone without trace
Give what you want take what you need
Squeezing so hard there's no room to breathe
And your flavor has fallen from grace
That's alright there's a change in the story
That's alright there's a change in the plan
A twist in the tale
I saw you dancing
Dancing on air
You were lost in the in the starlight
No one but me really cared
Every question turns out a lie
Can't you swallow the truth for once in your life
I loved you but don't ask me why
It's alright there's a change in the story
It's alright there's a change in the plan
A twist in the tale

Blackout, heatwave, .44 caliber homicide
The bums drop dead and dogs gone mad
In packs on the West Side
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide
She wants to hit those bricks
Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound
I don't want to hear it but he won't turn it down
Life is tough but it's just enough
To hold back the tears until it's closing time
I survived, I'm still alive
But I'm getting close to the borderline
Close to the borderline
A buck three eighty
Won't buy you much lately on the street these days
And when you can get gas
You know you can't drive fast anymore on the parkways
Rich man, poor man, either way American
Shoved into the lost and found
The no nuke yell we're gonna all go to hell
With the next big meltdown
I got remote control and a color T.V.
I don't change channels so they must change me
I got real close friends that will get me high
They don't know how to talk and they ain't gonna try
I shouldn't bitch, I shouldn't cry
I'd start a revolution but I don't have time
I don't know why I'm still a nice guy
But I'm getting close to the borderline
Close to the borderline
I thought I'd sacrifice so many things
I thought I'd throw them all away
I didn't think I needed anything
But you can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay
I need a doctor for my pressure pills
I need a lawyer for my medical bills
I need a banker to finance my home
But I need security to back my loan
It isn't new what I'm going through
But everybody knows you got to break sometime
Another night I fought the good fight
But I'm getting closer to the borderline
Closer to the borderline

We are called out, we are ransomed
We are not of the world we're in
We are chosen, we are blessed
To bring light to the lives of men
So Father sow Your seed
Give us life in community
Wake us from our sleep
This is Your time, this is Your place
And we are vessels for breaking
Under Your grace, we are led by Your Spirit
You have redeemed us by the blood of Your Son
Send down Your Word, we are eager to hear it
Ready our hearts to carry Your love
You are sunlight and You are morning
You're the hope of a brand new day
You are comfort and You are blessing
And You wipe all our tears away
So change us from within
Render miracles from our sin
Remind us once again
This is Your time, this is Your place
We are vessels for breaking
Under Your grace, we are led by Your Spirit
You have redeemed us by the blood of Your Son
Send down Your Word, we are eager to hear it
Ready our hearts to carry Your love
Under Your grace, we are led by Your Spirit
You have redeemed us by the blood of Your Son
Send down Your Word, we are eager to hear it
Ready our hearts to carry Your love
(Carry Your love)
To carry Your love
(Carry Your love)
To carry Your love
(Carry Your love)
Oh, carry Your, carry Your love
To carry Your love
(Carry Your love)
Carry Your love
(Carry Your love)
To carry Your love
(Carry Your love)
(Ooh, carry Your love)
(Ooh, carry Your love)

Echoes of the Broadway Everglades,
With her mythical madonnas still walking in their shades:
Lenny Bruce, declares a truce and plays his other hand.
Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin', head buried in the sand.
Sirens on the rooftops wailing, but there's no ship sailing.
Groucho, with his movies trailing, stands alone with his punchline failing.
Klu Klux Klan serve hot soul food and the band plays 'In the Mood'
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand, there's a smell of
Peach blossom and bitter almonde.
Caryl Chessman sniffs the air and leads the parade, he know in a scent,
You can bottle all you made.
There's Howard Hughes in blue suede shoes, smiling at the majorettes
Smoking Winston Cigarettes.
And as the song and dance begins, the children play at home
With needles; needles and pins.

Oh what a beautiful evening
Oh what a beautiful night
I've got the strangest feeling
I'm gonna ........... it tonight
? ? ?
Maybe I can be that man
Finally get to understand
Maybe I can be that man
The person that I wanna be
Has always been inside of me
Maybe you just never see
Chorus:
Out of many
I am the one (x3)
The one you know, you know
Oh what a beautiful evening
Oh what a beautiful night
I've got the sweetest feeling
You're gonna kiss me tonight
? ? ?
I know now what I've gotta be
The past is here in front of me
The future's something you can't see
The only thing that's really true
Has always been inside of me
Maybe you just never see
Chorus
/....................... we are one
Let's get together and sing this song/
? ? ?
Chorus

She gave you everything she had
But she was young and dumb
She'd just turned twenty-one
She didn't care to hang around
So when the shit came down
Why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing
That you had ever seen
You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landside
In physical terms
With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp
When you'd go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
They could not belive
That such a body was real
It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you come near the clouds would disappear
Because you lokked just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash
And suddenly a spell was cast
You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landside
In physical terms
You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the ligt in hidden parts
You make the whole world wanna dance
You bought yourself a second chance
Go baby go go
We're right behind you
Go baby go go
Yeah we're right behind you
Go baby go go
Aw baby we're right behind you
Go baby
Go baby
Yeah we're lookin at you
Go

I've been down and I'm nothing at all
And sometimes I feel I've grown
Never try to let it show
But I'm not alone
If you sing this song
I'll take you there
If you don't care
[Chorus:]
Going to the valley of angels
To swim in the deep blue sea
Surrounded by your faith and your glory
Is where I find my peace
So peace
In the valley of angels...
In the valley of angels
Heard so many stories, I thought they were lies (but you know they're true)
I know that I have quit before I even tried (ahhh, but you could not worry)
I stood up one day and found myself
But I'm not alone
If you sing this song
I'll take you there
If you don't care...
Then go with me!
[Chorus:]
All you ever dreamed to see...
You can touch, you don't believe
Lying here on angels' wings...
[Chorus:]
(Going to the valley of angels)
To the valley of angels
(Going to the valley of angels)
Ahaaaa...yeah

Well the street lights shine
Down on Blessing Avenue
Lovers they walk by
Holdin' hands two by two
A breeze crosses the porch
Bicycle spokes spin 'round
Jacket's on, I'm out the door
Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
Kid's rubber ball smacks
Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light
Big bank clock chimes
Off go the sleepy front porch lights
Downtown the store's alive
As the evening's underway
Things been a little tight
But I know they're gonna turn my way
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
Frankie's Diner's
Over on the edge of town
Neon sign spinnin' round
Like a cross over the lost and found
Fluorescent lights
Flicker above Bob's Grill
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks "fill?"
And says "penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill"
She went away
She cut me like a knife
Hello beautiful thing
Maybe you could save my life
In just a glance
Down here on Magic Street
Love's a fool's dance
I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la

Dearest Jane I should've known better
But I couldn't say hello, I don't know why
But now I think, I think you were sad
Yes you were, you were, you were
What I say, I say only to you
Cause I love and I love only you
Dearest Jane, I want to give you a dream
That no one has given you
Remember when we found misery
We watched her, watched her spread her wings
And slowly, slowly fly around our room
And she asked for your gentle mind
Misery is a butterfly
Her heavy wings will warp your mind
With her small ugly face
And her long antenna
And her black and pink heavy wings
Remember when we found misery
We watched her, watched her spread her wings
And slowly, slowly fly around our room
And she asked for your gentle mind
Gentle mind
Gentle mind
Misery is a butterfly

Hey, girl, come on walk a while with me now
I'm countin' on you to make it
Let's slip out and find the way somehow
I know you can fake it I know you're still far away
Well, I know you can fake it
And I know it's outta hand, okay
But I know you can take it
There's a part you're always leavin' out
This feelin' I can't shake it
It's not that I don't know what you're about
I know you can fake it I know it's all far away
Come on, you can make it
And I know it's outta hand, okay
But I know you can take it
And I know it won't be long
And I know it won't be long
When you'll come out and I'll be gone
Hey girl, won't you show me now ?
Don't know if I can take it
Can't you just believe yourself somehow
I know you can fake it I know you're still far away
I know you can't take it
And I know it's outta hand,
okay Is no way you can fake it
And I know it won't be long
And I know it won't be long
And if you felt this all along
And if it's time to say you're wrong
Come on out and I'll be gone
Come on out and I'll be gone

Everybody's looking for last gang in town
You better watch out for they're all comin' around
The sport of today is exciting
The in crowd are into infighting
When some punk sees some rock-olla
It's rock and roll all over
In every street and every station
Kids fight like different nations
And it's brawn against brain
And it's knife against chain
But it's all young blood
Flowing down the drain
The Crops hit the Stiffs
An' the Spikes whipped the Quiffs
They're all looking 'round
For the last gang in town
Meanwhile down in black town
Those old soul rebels are haingin' around
An' when some punk come a looking for sound
Rastafari goes to ground
The white heart flipped his pocket dipped
'cause a black sharp knife never slips
And they never say to one another
That tomorrow we might kill our brothers
Down from the edge of London
The rockabilly rebels came
From another edge of London
Skinhead gangs call out their name
But not the Zydeco kids
From the high rise
Though they can't be recognized
When you hear a Cajun fiddle
Then you're nearly in the middle
Of the last gang in town

If I was a hero
A superhero
I'd know what to do
If I was a hunter
Fearless hunter
I wouldn't mind to shoot
But I am just a girl
Have no supernatural
Powers to combat you
I should be running running running
I'm strong enough to save the world
Can't get enough
Unlimited love
Not ashamed to say the word
Can't get enough
Of this unlimited love
If I wasn't lonely
Very lonely
I could resist you
If you were mistaking
It would be easy
Not to miss you
But I am just a girl
Have no supernaturals
Powers to combat you
And even if I could
I would feel misunderstood
Howling at the full moon
I should be running running running
But I'm still here waiting
I'm strong enough to save the world
Can't get enough
Unlimited love
Not ashamed to say the word
Can't get enough
Of this unlimited love

I remember your eyes from the 12th of July
When the sirens were screamin' and the flames lit the sky
And you held me so tight, thought you'd never let go
'Til the bullets exploded on the pavement below
And I laid you down next to a burnt out car
Screamed out for help but you were gone too far
Still got that picture of you locked away from the start
Developing inside my fanatic heart
I went around in a daze for a couple of years
With the blood in my veins frozen over with tears
And I did anything that they asked me to do
'Cause all I could see was that picture of you
And the young ones passin' by'd say, "how's about you - real hard man"
Deep down inside I was just a castle of sand
Still had that picture of you locked away from the start
Developing inside my fanatic heart
Then they took me inside, threw me up against a wall
They put electric prods on my chest and my balls
And they told me to sign things that I knew weren't true
And in the end I did what they told me to do
Then they locked me up and threw away the key
And left me there with just your memory
Now I walk through New York like a grey silhouette
Tryin' hard to remember what I'm supposed to forget
That look in your eyes on the 12th of July
When the sirens were screamin' and the flames lit the sky
Hey I sleep with other women and I hold them through the night
'Cause all I want to do is just get on with my life
But that picture of you won't let me make a new start
It's frozen inside my fanatic heart.

Ill try to find my inspiration in this beautiful day
Since there is nothing else worth watching on my TV
Everyday I wake up but theres somewhere else
That I would rather be
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
'Cause you should lie down, you could cry now
Everyday, everyday another place, another place
Entertain, entertain, remain a slave to every stage
Leading parades of idiocy
Whos coming with me?
Kicking and screaming
Not having trouble finding just where you fit in, no
Never was an issue to begin with
Everyday I wake up but theres somewhere else
That I would rather be
You dont know what I mean
You dont know what I mean
'Cause you should lie down, you could cry now
Everyday, everyday, another place, another place
Entertain, entertain, remain a slave to every stage
Everyday, everyday, another place, another place
Entertain, entertain, remain a slave to every stage
Leading parades of idiocy
Whos coming with me?
Kicking or screaming
I know what I am, I know what I am
I know what I am, I'm kicking or screaming
I know what I am, I'm kicking or screaming

Runnin' everywhere
From the corner to the square
Goin' up and down around all day.
Lookin' for booze, got nothin' to lose,
Gonna show you what I wanna do.
Slash with fingers, feel my eyes, and rip them from my face.
Got the whole plan think I'm goin' more insane,
As I feel it comin' back again.
Pressure point is building higher 'n' higher.
[Chorus]
Walls around me don't seem to charm me,
I've got to change their little minds.
Lies they told me, were lies to keep me here,
And turn around and you will find.
Bars surround me, still I feel free,
From all the madness locked outside of me.
Walking down the hall,
As I bumped into a wall, see white figures all right in tow.
Lookin' for more, so they shut all the doors,
And lock me in fore evermore.
Slash your throat with broken glass,
Get back where you belong.
Never going home, so I carry on alone,
No matter that they're insane.
Pressure point is building higher 'n' higher.
[Chorus: x2]

Tell me through your beard the USA is weird, Aah
Hide your fears with hats and hang out at your flat, Aah
Don't know what I see but your song sounds good to me, Aah
All I want to do is listen to you's
All I want to do is listen to you's
All I want to do is listen to you's
Now I'm not so alone
Now I'm not so alone
Didn't realise that I was mesmerised, Aah
Had to fall asleep so I sank down at your feet, Aah
I ain't got no choice 'cause i just love your voice, Aah
All I want to do is listen to you's
All I want to do is listen to you's
All I want to do is listen to you's
Now I'm not so alone
Now I'm not so alone
Lying in my bed I think of stuff you said, Aah
But I ain't understanding, I'm sonically crash landing, Aah
I'll give you 50 pounds for every little sound, Aah
All I want to do is listen to you's
All I want to do is listen to you's
All I want to do is listen to you's
Now I'm not so alone
Now I'm not so alone

There's thorns on the cactus tree
There's thorns on the rose
There's thorns in the heart of me
That nobody knows
They tear at the flesh until
The tears start to rise
They form in my heart
But they fall from Anastasia's eyes.
And I was lost in the wilderness
Without courage or hope
I was setting my signal fires
And watching the smoke
When out of the smoke appeared
The sweetest surprise
And I knew I'd been found
When first I looked in
To Anastasia's eyes.
There's thorns on the cactus tree
There's thorns on the rose
There's thorns in the heart of me
That nobody knows
But finally I've found out where
My salvation lies
It lies in the love that lives
In Anastasia's eyes

You're a no good heartbreaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good
They don't know that I would leave you if I could
I guess I'm on tight
And I'm stuck like glue
Cause I ain't never
I ain't never
I ain't never, no, no,
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you
Sometimes I know I thought
You would run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't you never never say that we're through
Cause I ain't never
Never
Never no no
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you
I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me
I ain't never loved a girl
I ain't never loved a girl
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad
What am I gonna do about it
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to her
I'm gonna hold on to her

You don't want the sun to shine in
So you turn the curtains down
Your eyes still don't show me a thing
And you don't feel it's sunny outside
You don't want no joy for a while
But you stay up late at night
It hurts you that she's still alive
So you'll raise flowerbeds inside
But she she won't get bothered at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Water and poetry
Cause she will not bother at all
She's just watching the water at fall
You should give them just what they need
Cause she will not bother at all
But you won't say you're not adored by her beauty, Celia inside
You don't want to feel her at all
But who's that fellowman of hers
With who your dear Celia moved
And they'll sleep happily inside

Light me a candle, I'm comin' home.
Then leave it by your side where I belong.
I've been in this cold world for so long.
So Light me a candle, I'm coming home.
I wanna feel the love that's in the hearts;
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves,
That's where my Christmas lives.
Snow on the window, asleep by the fire
Somehow these children never get tired
Missing the ones that, we wish were here
Remembering the ones who look on but we don't shed a tear
I wanna feel the love that's in the hearts;
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves,
That's where my Christmas lives.
In these heart set loves,
That's where my Christmas lives
All along the halls are ringing,
Choirs singing Christmastime is gone,
In trees the lights are streaming,
Children gleaming Christmas time is gone,
Ooh we still knowing Christmas time is gone
Ooh we still knowing
I wanna feel the love that's in the hearts;
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves,
That's where my Christmas lives
That's where my Christmas lives
That's where my Christmas lives

Driving through your childhood, and all the stories that youve told me since we first met. I get the feeling that you're forgetting to tell me what you're trying to forget. As we walk across the park on the iced over grass you start to talk about all the times when, and all the nights when, and the underneath us breaking like glass.
This is the park where you fell asleep, and couldnt tell if it was a dream, when you opened your eyes and saw the man hiding in the trees. This is the street where the woman died, she had the problem of being too sweet, and how naive of me to think I couldnt get homesick in a week. All the sweethearts here litter the streets, the liberal and artistic minds. They walk hand and hand and kiss each others cheeks when they meet. They have got everything in common and the conversations never stop, theyve all got the one about running all night from the campus cops.
But behind the trees at the overpass-a girl was once crushed by a train, running to catch up with her friends, her life turned into one day. And the town carries on-and the town heals with time, everyone tries so hard to chase these ghosts from their mind. And how naive of me to think that i couldnt get homesick in a week.
It starts to snow as the quartet down the street warms up the strings. I'm in the wrong hometown. It feels like its time to leave. I'm in the wrong hometown for Christmas Eve.

The time has come again
Throw a kiss and lose a friend
Some things are just better left in the past
Tomorrow never knows
Passes by, comes and goes
Can you tell me how long will love last?
I'll remember you and me
And how it felt inside
I guess it wasn't meant to be
But it's so hard to say goodbye
Why do the winds of change carry us away?
They leave us lost and torn apart
What are we searching for, never sure
Wanting more?
Maybe that's the mystery of the heart
Love is rare and life is strange
Nothing lasts and people change
Memories that time just can't erase
Wish I could go back, I know
How I want to hold you so
I'd give anything to see your face
Lonely dreams of yesterday
Like footprints in the sand
Wish that I could find a way
But I'll never understand

You tell me we never talk
And I won't share my thoughts
Then you hate my point of view
Because I don't agree with you
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You love me with your lazy eye
Tell me not to do the things I do
(You're so lazy that you never do do)
You say that I'm a crazy guy
When it's clearly you who is cuckoo
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(35 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You're always telling me I drink too much
Then you're happy when we're apart
If I say we should be that way
You say you wouldn't live another day
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You love me with your lazy eye
Tell me not to do the things I do
(You're so lazy that you never do do)
You say that I'm a crazy guy
When it's clearly you who is cuckoo
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
Say it's your friend's birthday
And I think your friends a fool
I don't wanna go so you say
I think I'm cool
15 reasons not to spend my life with you
You love me with your lazy eye
Tell me not to do the things I do
You say that I'm a crazy guy
When clearly it's you who is cuckoo
15 reasons not to spend my life with you
You stink of cigarette juice
I beg you to stop it's no use
I ask you to step outside
And you blow it deeper into my mind
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You love me with your lazy eye
Tell me not to do the things I do
(You're so lazy that you never do do)
You say that I'm a crazy guy
When it's clearly you who is cuckoo
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You tell me we never talk
And I won't share my thoughts
Then you hate my point of view
Because I don't agree with you
15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You love me with your lazy eye
Tell me not to do the things I do
(You're so lazy that you never do do)
You say that I'm a crazy guy
When it's clearly you who is cuckoo
15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(25 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
You love me with your lazy eye
Tell me not to do the things I do
(You're so lazy that you never do do)
You say that I'm a crazy guy
When it's clearly you who is cuckoo
I've got 15 reasons not to spend my life with you
(35 reasons why I wouldn't want to)
Hello

Looking out the window, the trees are getting closer it seems.
Thinking bout you Darling.
Adding up the cost of these dreams.
Strapped to this projectile, just a blink ago I was back in school.
Smoking by the gym door, practicing my rock-star attitude
And I'm scared shitless of what's coming next.
I'm scared shitless, these angels I see in the trees are waiting for me.
The engines have stopped now. We all know we are going down. Last call for alcohol.
Sure wish I could have another round.
And I'm scared shitless of what's coming next.
Scared shitless, these angels I see in the trees are waiting for me.
Waiting for me.
Friends in the swamp.
Friends on the ground, in the trees.
Angels and fuselage.

You tell me you don't love me over a cup of coffee
And I just have to look away
A million miles between us
Planets crashing to dust
I just let it fade away
I'm walking empty streets hoping we might meet
I see your car parked on the road
The light on at your window
I know for sure that you're home
But I just have to pass on by
So no of course we can't be friends
Not while I'm still this obsessed
I guess I always knew the score
This is how our story ends
I smoke your brand of cigarettes
And pray that you might give me a call
I lie around in bed all day just staring at the walls
Hanging round bars at night wishing I had never been born
And give myself to anyone who wants to take me home
So no of course we can't be friends
Not while I still feel like this
I guess I always knew the score
This is where our story ends
You left behind some clothes
My belly somersaults when I pick them off the floor
My friends all say they're worried
I'm looking far too skinny
I've stopped returning all their calls
And no of course we can't be friends
Not while I'm still so obsessed
I want to ask where I went wrong
But don't say anything at all
It took a cup of coffee
To prove that you don't love me

Every day I sit beside you
On the bus to Madison Avenue
Work in the big gray store
With the revolving doors
You dont even know my name
I guess that Im to blame
Dont know the right things to say
So I pretend away
That Im Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine
Oh, wont you come in out of the rain
Thingsll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like theres no tomorrow
And youll know what Im thinking of
Right before your eyes, I fall in love with you
Do, do, do
Today Im done with games
(Today Im done with games)
Gonna ask you for your name
Say Ive been watching you
I even know what you do
Maybe today, Ill tell you
(Maybe today, Ill tell you)
Ive found the nerve to sell you
On a guy like me
Who wishes that he could be
Your Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine
Oh, wont you come in out of the rain
Thingsll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like theres no tomorrow
And youll know what Im thinking of
Right before your eyes, I fall in love with you
Do, do, do
Right before your eyes, I fall in love with you
Right before my eyes, youll say you love me too
Rudolph Valentino
I pull up in my limousine
Oh, wont you come in out of the rain
Thingsll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like theres no tomorrow
And youll know what Im thinking of, ooh
Do, do, do

Hello, it's mercy medical
we're sorry to inform you of
this situation critical. Hello,
it's mercy medical,
we've done everything we can do
there's nothing left
its up to her and so
welcome to your funeral
where they talk about the girl they knew,
a tragedy a shame to lose her, oh.
A little girl so beautiful
a life so new and meaningful,
that little girl so beautiful.
Is it difficult to swallow
when the air is thin
and you can hardly breathe?
Tell them now,
they'll listen now,
they'll help you now,
just tell them how.
Does it feel like nothing ever changes,
and make you want to sleep forever?
Tell them now,
they'll listen now,
they'll help you now,
just tell them how.
It's bravery to stay away
from ending life before it's over.
Hello.

I never really meant to hurt you
it was the only way to keep you be my side
the kiss of death is what I gave you
I know you're never coming back to me
This love was meant to last forever
I took your heart and I took your soul away
You told me we were goin' nowhere
but like a fool I was beggin' you to stay
I know you're lookin' for a new thrill
it was the only reason why you had to die
I'm lookin' up into the sky
I've realized love is a lie

Hold on a red line
You're taking more than I'd like
It's getting harder
But it's so what I want to be
You're talking to a dead man
You listen like a wet cat
I'm too elated
This is so what I want to be
Farther away but
Feeling better than i've ever
Wanted to say
You'll never get a step ahead of me
Hold on a red line
You're taking more than i'd like
You make it harder
But it's so what i want to be
You're talking to a dead man
You listen like a wet cat
I'm too elated
This is so what i want to be
Farther away but
Feeling better than i've ever
Wanted to say
You'll never get a step ahead of
Farther away but
Feeling better than i've ever
Wanted to say
You'll never get a step ahead of me

A step apart, I don't fit In with my peers, but I don't give a shit Laughed at in the streets of my town Their laughter hurts, but I'll hold my ground
Hold Your...GROUND Hold Your...Hold Your Ground
It's time to stand up, for what you believe Have no fear of your critics Be proud of the life you lead You may be different from your friends but if their true they'll understand
Hold your ground - Be yourself and be the best you can Step Out!
Conformity, the easy way to be accepted I'd rather be outcast any day. It's hard to be yourself with all the pressures coming down, It takes a strong fucking person to hold your ground.
Hold You...GROUND Hold Your...Hold Your Ground

Love under fire
We stand in the flame
Now and forever
After the rain
When is forever ?
You can take it from me
It may be never
C'est la vie
Love under fire
And we stand in the flame
Now and forever
After the rain
When is forever ?
You can take it from me
It may be never
Just wait and see
You can hide in the jungle
You can climb up a tree
You can scan the horizon
Tell me what do you see ?
As cold as a mountain
With a heart that can freeze
There's a storm on the water
With every heart that she sees
Love under fire
===========================================================================

Strange to be on Marvel Hill
I've walked some years to find
I know there is a piece to fill
The gap I have in mind
No nothing's here I close my eyes
It's on the other side
And what I've worked so hard to gain
I'd gladly give away
'Cause I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
A postcard from where life is a thrill
On top of Marvel Hill
But I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
No, I don' t need this
Too good to be true
Too good to ignore
I don't need this
I need so much more
It's too much to ask

One, two, three, four
Gonna make a record in the month of May
In the month of May, in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away
Month of May, it's a violent thing
In the city, their hearts start to sing
Well, some people sing, it sounds like they're screaming
Used to doubt it but now I believe it
Month of May, everybody's in love
And the city was sent from above
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
The violent wind blew the wires away
We were shocked in the suburbs
Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
I said some things are pure, and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
So young, so young
So much pain for someone so young
Well, I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight?
First they built the road
Then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around
2009, 2010 wanna make a record how I felt then
When we stood outside in the month of may
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away
If I die in the month of May
Let the wind take my body away, yeah
Wish I may or wish I might
But meet me down there with my arms folded tight
Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away
Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away
Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires
The wires away

Fido stayed all night, he would not go home
I asked him to leave, I said I do not have that bone
I was feelin' lonesome sittin' by the phone
Wide awake stayin' up late wishin' I was home
You were on the outside talking to some chick
I was on the inside feelin' mighty sick
Sleep is what I wanted, you know what I got
Wide awake
Dogs have it made, lyin' round in the shade
Never have to worry about get there on time
I can't help but wonder what was on your mind
Ridin' round in the pouring rain, havin' a heck of time
Livin' may be easy, dyin' may be hard
But I'm wide awake stayin' up late, sendin' my regards

When I was young my father said
Son I have something to say
And what he told me Ill never forget
Until my dyin day.
He said son you are a bachelor boy
And thats the way to stay.
Son, you be a bachelor boy until your dyin day
When I was sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as could be.
But I rememberd just in time,
What my daddy said to me.
He said son you are a bachelor boy
And thats the way to stay.
Son, you be a bachelor boy until your dyin day
As time goes by I propably will
Meet a girl and fall in love
Then Ill get married have a wife and a child
And theyll be my turtle doves.
But until then Ill be a bachelor boy and thats the way Ill stay,
Happy to be a bachelor boy,
Until my dyin day.
But until then Ill be a bachelor boy and thats the way Ill stay,
Happy to be a bachelor boy,
Until my dyin day.

Just another face in the crowd
Wandering towards obscurity.
Driven by the dull desires
Of a worn out routine.
Stagnant in the suffocating silence
Of emotional exile,
A fugitive from freedom
Surrenders to mediocrity.
A helpless voice
Starting to sink.
You could make a choice
But you never learned to think
Weary and weakened
Victims fall prey
To vague ideals
And passionless play.
Systematic spontaneity
In synchronized society.
Immersed in the cause
And the call of the day,
Sacrificed inner needs
Give way.
To shared individuality
In collective reality.
A spirit of belonging
Satisfies your longing
But the truth is never seen.
False sense of freedom grows
But dependency shows
Your part of the machine.
A hopeless choice,
Searching for someone real.
You could find that voice
But you never learned to feel.

They stand to fight for nothing.
We show them how stupid we've become.
As fortune favors only
Those who care to much to see.
Oh it will never be okay,
As some will say.
We stand to fight for nothing,
So close your eyes and stay away.
Don't believe their headlines
They poison our lives, everyday
Oh it will never be the same,
The purpose bearing everyday.
The lies that lead you into the grave.
As some will say.
And you will never be okay,
As some will say.
Purpose bearing everyday,
As some will say.
Lies that lead you to the grave,
As some will say.

I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky (good Lord)
I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky
Well, I gots to drink me two fifths of whiskey
Just to get half as high
When the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town
Oh, when the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town
Well, when he was feelin' high
Oh, he sure should have been feelin' low
Mr. Perry!
I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky
I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky
Lord, I gots to drink me two fifths of whiskey
Just to get, just to get, half as high

Well, I, jump and fled this fuckin' heap on doctored wings
My flailin' pinions, with splints and rags and crutches
(Damn things nearly hardly flap)
Canker upon canker upon one million tiny punctures
That look like long thin red ribbons
Draped across the arms of a lil' mortal girl
(Like a ground plan of hell)
Curse these smartin' strings, these fuckin' ruptures
Enough, enough is enough
(If this is heaven ah?m bailin' out)
If this is heaven ah?m bailin' out
I can't tolerate this ol tin-tub
So fulla trash and rats felt one crawl across my soul
For a seckon there, as thought as wassa back down in the ghetto
(Rats in paradise! rats in paradise)
I'm bailin' out, there?s a mutiny in heaven
I wassa born and Lord shakin'
Even then was dumped into some icy font
Like some great stinky unclean
From slum-chuch to slum-church, I spilt my heart
To some fat cunt behind a screen
Evil poppin' eye pressed up to the opening
He?d slide shut the lil' perforated hatch at night my body
Blushed to the whistle of the birch
With a lil' practice I soon learnt to use in on myself
Punishment? Reward, punishment?
Reward, well, ah tied on, perched on my bed
I was stickin' a needle in my arm
Ah tied off! fuckin' wings burst out my back
(Like I was cuttin' teeth)
I took off
(Rats in paradise! rats in paradise)
There?s a mutiny in Heaven
Oh Lord, I git down on my knees
(I git down on my knees and start to pray)
Wrapped in my mongrel wings, ah nearly freeze
In the howlin' wind and drivin' rain
(All the trash blowin' round and round)
From slum-heaven into town
I take my tiny pain and rollin' back my sleeve
Roll Anna, roll Anna, roll Anna roll)
I yank the drip outa my vein, utopiate! I?m bailin' out
Utopiate, if this is Heaven ah?m bailin' out
My threadbare soul teems with vermin and louse
Thoughts come like a plague to the head,in God?s house
Mutiny in Heaven
(Ars infectio forco dio)
To the plank
(Rats in paradise! rats in paradise)
I?m bailin' out
(Hail hypuss dermio vita rex)
Hole inna ghetto! hole inna ghetto
(Scabio murem per sanctum, dio, dio, dio)

Well there's a ruckus on the levee
Unruly crowd on the courthouse steps
And if I make it till Sunday
I'm sho'nuff gonna ask the good Lord for help
With a mouthful of salt I try to explain
If money was sand I couldn't hold one grain
I feel like a thief that knows he's been framed
For leaving the watch but stealing the chain
Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day
Well the late nights got me reeling
Spillin' out the bottle right into the next day
Got a funny little feeling gonna be like this until my dying day
There's mud in my eye but I can still see
Everybody in town is tryin' to murder me
If they don't get me s'pose the hangman will
I better think twice about making this deal
Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day
Magnolia, magnolia
Let me rest under the shade of your leaves
Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day
Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day

I'm living with your memory
In the attic in my mind
And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
'cause when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know
When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was
And you, you fade
But the memory remains the same
And I, I can't change
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane
You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
'cause your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left

Fallow drama
I'm listening for the fruit to fall, love
Baked in the footlight
Some buttermilk free love cult
Lady or the tiger
Our runaway summertime hit
Slather me with butter
Ring around the world ash pit
Out in the wide net
Skan and the owlkin
Know not where
Their next meal
Is coming from
Airliner fallopian juke
Open up wide
I'll lift you up
Tiger tail
And I just can't let it go

A piece of my heart cries out loudly
For the funeral of innocence
To tell the truth, this elaborate story
Of goodness not so plausible
Stay at home at night
The mark of Cain is upon you
There's a sign on your forehead
There's no way you can stay out
A piece of my heart eyes the wheel in motion
With suspicion of coincidence
It don't grab me now, to swallow the notion
Of accident that no one meant
Stay at home at night
The mark of Cain is upon you
While we look for solutions
It's not safe when you go out
Burning up the night up the night
The heat is on
Do you do what you can do?
It looks like to me that you are only playing a part
Do you do what you can do?
Talk slow, in a trance

Starlight laser points at you
Sing to the ghost of summers blue
Lay back, transcend into the moon
Mother of wisdoms' holy tomb
Phase your mind, let it take you away
Into the ocean in your mind
Back in time, take it phaser quest
Endless visions, million miles high
Robot systems in control
Dissect your soul of golden rules
Nature groovin' by your side
She gave you wings, now learn to fly
Phase your mind, let it take you away
Into the ocean in your mind
Back in time, take it phaser quest
Endless visions, million miles high
[Incomprehensible]
Sun shines eternally in you
The darkest day is silver too
Straight line into the galaxy
Spirals and circles, harmony
Phase your mind, let it take you away
Into the ocean in your mind
Back in time, take it phaser quest
Endless visions, million miles high

[Chorus:]
Save me a mountain to climb
Save me a river to cross
At midnight the sound of the stockyard trains
Wail in the distance and rattle my chains
Save me a valley like the one in the distance
Save me a canyon to swallow this jail
I wanna stand outside and feel the rain when it falls
Breathe the air on the other side of these walls
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out
Save me a desert, just me and the sand
Save me a sea to sail
In my heart I know I'm too weak to be strong
I've been wasting away in this jail for too long
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It's like a choir of fallen angels when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out
"Has the jury reached a verdict?"
"We have your honour."
"How does the jury find?"
"We find the defendant guilty."
"Do the defendants have anything to say on their behalf
Before the court pronounces sentence?"
[Chorus]
If only I could tie all these dreams together
I could break out of the big house and run forever
Save a mountain for me
Oh save a mountain for me
It's like a choir of fallen angels when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out
Save a mountain for me
Save it, save it
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for when I get out
I need a mountain
Save a mountain.

There's a dimmer light in this room tonight
And you'll be the last one to know when it's off
So with this dimmer light in my room tonight
I wonder if we're gonna make it at all, at all, at all
And there's a brighter sky to this dreadful night
And you and me are the first to watch it fade
So with this brighter sky from my room tonight
I feel, down here, a little more betrayed
How do I get back to where I was?
When you were smiling
You were smiling
How do I get back to where I was?
When you were smiling
(You were smiling, baby)
You were smiling, baby
Now there's a tempt to die under this heartless sky
We'll bid farewell without an ear to hear me
A tempt to die and not put up a fight
'Cause no one ever wanted to end this early
How do I get back to where I was?
When you were smiling
You were smiling
How do I get back to where I was?
When you were smiling
(You were smiling, baby)
So there's that bright light, the one that leaded me here
The one that's screaming to be noticed
The one responsible for all of this
So I'll take this other road, after I get up from my knees
Because I'm sick of being lied to
And I'm
(Afraid of where the other one leads)
You were smiling, baby

Gonna scrape the trouble off my boots!
As they were dancing in the evening
And the light shone through the trees
This girl my eye was following
Asked the band to play her a beat
Singin' she'd do that long time jerk
She hit me where it hurts
Ohhh your heart
Now my heart will burst
Oh no
Ah, but it took me back to that wonderland
I witnessed long ago
Babbling words of preachers
Sayin'- "Don't bury me no more"
Ohh...
And I've forgotten how to worry
And I don't know how to run
Against the odds I realize
This struggle could be won!
We dance
Long time jerk
She did it to me first
Ohhh my heart
With that long time jerk
Ah! Say..... Do that long time jerk.
Bring on those tapes from the past
They make you look better in a mirror
Feel that long time jerkin'
Between the taker and the giver
Feel that...
Long time jerk
She hit me where it hurts
Oh I felt my heart
Now my heart will burst
I've forgotten how to worry
And I don't know how to run
Against the odds I realize
This struggle could be fun!
Oh, through lanes and streets and houses
And reversing rush of time
She made me re-invent the world
Before inventing time
(Before inventing time)
Long time jerk
Oh, she hit me where it hurts
Ohhhhh my heart
Long time jerk
Long, long, long, long, long
Long time
Long time jerk

Come down to my house
Stick a stone in your mouth
You can always pull out
If you like it too much
Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There'll be nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
A hit is hard to resist
And I never miss
I can take you out
With just a flick of my wrist
Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsessions
There is nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
This thing you'll never doubt
And I'll feed your obsession
The falling star that you cannot live without
I will be your religion
This thing you'll never doubt
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me

Deeper and deeper, I go
Your hearts drownin', I know
All my intentions are clear
I need to rescue my dear
So I dive, don't despair
Coming down with a mouthful of air
To share
To swim with the shellfish, I wish
And suck with the sea queen, I wish
Muscles and coral are here
I need to rescue my dear
So I dive, don't despair
In the gloom just assume that I care
Coming down with a mouthful of air
To share

Got a photograph of a smile
Taken way back when we could smile
Now this plane will take me
Where I don't know
Maybe Tokyo
'Cause there's no memories over Tokyo
And there's no hurting over Tokyo
Got a photograph of some tears
Taken presently with more tears
Now I'll search for happiness
Where should I go
Maybe Tokyo
Attention will this pain go away
My condition oh it's just not the same

Sometimes, I get the feeling, things won't fall apart
Sometimes, I think it's gone too far
Sometimes, I get the feeling things seems pretty nice
Then again sometimes, I'd like to leave you twice
Once we decide upon it
We won't fall apart
This time, I think it's gone too far
And you get where you can't decide
Don't ask any other
And you get where you can't decide
Didn't I say, sorry
Didn't I say, dear
Didn't I consider?
Didn't I stand clear?
Didn't you say, New boy get down on your knees?
Did I say, Trying, I'm trying, I'm trying?

I just stepped outside of a dream
Nothing ever is as it seems
The wind keeps whistling the same old tune
You lay asleep in the light of the moon
So silently I peered through the trees
My misery was in her beauty
Her hair hung long and her eyes were closed
Every moment she stole my soul
I'm in the forest so rare and devine
This is the place where you lose your mind
From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I... You
And she awoke and walked downstream
Stuck outside of that same old dream
I need to leave but my minds intrigued
Follow close as she does to me
Out of the forest to the church's gate
By her grave she awaits her fate
My only crime was to want too much
I could look but I could not touch
I'm in the forest so rare and devine
This is the place where you lose your mind
From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I... You

bowling with bedrock barney barney
he is the life of the party that barney
he likes his chilli con carne
that barney
i saw him down at the lodge meeting
he was the grand wizzo
and he was eating a bowl of fruity pebbles
he's gonna pour some for you some
cactus cooler and a steakasaurus
just escaped from the zoo
now i'm bowling with bedrock barney
he is the life of the party

I can't breathe when you're with me, I can't even think.
I swallow every promise you can never keep.
Now that I see you for what it is that you are.
I know there's nothing that you can do anymore.
Don't take this wrong, no,
Your never wrong.
But I'll tell you something.
You mean nothing.
I'll tell you something.
You mean nothing to me now.
As I wander through this joke that I call a life,
I wonder why I even tried to make it mine.
Don't take this wrong, no,
Your never wrong.
But I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing.
I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing to me now.
As you can see I already can feel no more.
Ignorance is good when you've found there's nothing left.
But I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing.
I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing to me now.

The sun is setting on the century
And we are armed to the teeth
We're all working together now
To make our lives mercifully brief
And school kids keep trying to teach us
What guns are all about
Confused liberty with weaponry
And watch your kids act it out
And every year now like christmas
Some boy gets the milk fed suburban blues
Reaches for the available arsenal
And saunters off to make the news
And the women in the middle
Are learning what poor women have always known
That the edge is closer than you think
When the men bring the guns home
Look at where the profits are
That's how you'll find the source
Of the big lie that you and I both know so well
By the time it takes this cultural
Death wish to run it's course
They're gonna to make a pretty penny
And then they're going to hell
He said the chickens all come home to roost
Malcolm forecast the flood
Are we really going to sleep through another century
While the rich profit off our blood
Yeah it may take some doing
To see this undoing through
But in my humble opinion
Here's what I suggest we do
Open fire on hollywood
Open fire on mtv
Open fire on nbc and cbs and abc
Open fire on the nra
And all the lies they told us along the way
Open fire on each weapons manufacturer
While he's giving head to some republican senator
And if I hear one more time
About a fools right to his tools of rage
I'm gonna take all my friends
And I'm going to move to Canada
And we're going to die of old age

They want to buy the look of my abuse
They want to use my blood to color their perfume
Get out of me
I know
Go go go
Just like a starfish
My legs will soon grow back
I'll just be ten times stronger
Each time that you attack me

Let me tell you about a girl I know
That comes alive when you take off her clothes
There's no telling just where shes been
Ask around but no one seems to know yeah
(yeah)
Late at night when your looking to sin
Call her up and she'll lay down the law
You cant trust her cause she'll lie to your face
But that's not why you gave her a call
(yeah)
Waist deep inside
Now that's the burning desire
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feel's alright
Til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Cause she's here for you it's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know
Another thing about this girl I know
She's more comfortable down on her knees
Went to school got a job and then she shot it to hell
All cause shes born to please yeah
(yeah)
Don't get her mixed up because she knows what she likes
Can tell the difference between
Right or wrong
She know's your watching every one of her moves
Just more reason to string you along yeah
Your waist deep inside
Now that's the burning desire
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feel's alright
Til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Cause she's here for you it's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know
The first time's hard enough
But you made it through
The second time
I see the changes in you
She's got you somehow
Your needing her now
(yeah)
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feel's alright
Til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Cause she's here for you it's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

She sits in her corner
Singing herself to sleep
Wrapped in all of the promises
That no one seems to keep
She no longer cries to herself
No tears left to wash away
Just diaries of empty pages
Feelings gone a stray
But she will sing
'Till everything burns
While everyone screams
Burning their lies
Burning my dreams
All of this hate
And all of this pain
I'll burn it all down
As my anger reigns
'Till everything burns
Ooh, oh
Walking through life unnoticed
Knowing that no one cares
Too consumed in their masquerade
No one sees her there
And still she sings
'Till everything burns
While everyone screams
Burning their lies
Burning my dreams
All of this hate
And all of this pain
I'll burn it all down
As my anger reigns
'Till everything burns
Everything burns
(Everything burns)
Everything burns
Watching it all fade away
(All fade away)
Everyone screams
Everyone screams
(Watching it all fade away)
Ooh, ooh
(While everyone screams)
Burning down lies
Burning my dreams
(All of this hate)
And all of this pain
I'll burn it all down
As my anger reigns
Til everything burns
(Everything burns)
Watching it all fade away
(Ooh, ooh)
(Everything burns)
Watching it all fade away.

A beam of light cuts through the dark
My angel enraged to hate
I see what life's all about
But I just can't relate
Reality will bring you to your knees
As life goes on
War within my reach
My war
War
An empty gaze at early dawn
Before the morning light
Instinct has become mistrust
No valves, wrong or right
A path of life that left it's mark
Like footprints in the snow
You can run, but you can't hide
You've got nowhere to go

Babe, it took a long, long time to get it out this way
Now, that the hurtin's over all I've got to say
(Is) that I know
Sure as I am living
It takes more than forgiving
'cause it ain't been easy
I know you did your best to please me
How can you love me,
After all the years we've tried
After all the tears you've cried
After our love has died
Babe, I've seen some pretty faces everywhere I go
I say now
Maybe I ain't the same person that you used to know
But I know
In my heart I'm livin'
For the love you've given
And the foolish thing about it
Is that I thought I'd live without it
How can you love me
When you know I've been with someone else
And I ain't too happy with myself
But I keep on comin' back around

As I came across the Pecos and broke west of the line
This thunderstorm was running and it ran me out of time
So I was racing through the rain with this rig from Tennessee
When a voice cut through the static, bringing comfort home to me
They were singing
I ain't sittin' in no shack
Got me a Ford right out the back
So come on and roll me over
If I ain't there in nothing flat
With a honky-tonk attitude
I'll be doing the straight line swing
Come on and grab your horseshoe
And throw it in the ring
Now the levee wall was breaking, rocks were rolling from the ridge
The announcer broke in, saying there was a bus trapped on the bridge
So I turned my rig around, I was axle-deep in mud
And I found those people stranded, the bridge was groaning in the flood
Still my radio was singing
I ain't sittin' in no shack
Got me a Ford right out the back
So come on and roll me over
If I ain't there in nothing flat
With a honky-tonk attitude
I'll be doing the straight line swing
Come on and grab your horseshoe
And throw it in the ring
With the grinding of my engine, I hauled those people free
With the raging river rising, the driver came thanking me
So I told him about the message; he said, That can't be right
The storm knocked out the radio tower late last Saturday night
But through the static we heard singing
I ain't sittin' in no shack
Got me a Ford right out the back
So come on and roll me over
If I ain't there in nothing flat
With a honky-tonk attitude
I'll be doing the straight line swing
Come on and grab your horseshoe
And throw it in the ring
Them old truckers gonna tell you down the lonely interstate
Out the dead air on the waveband, the Texas Playboys break
You'll hear a keening voice, Bob Wills is with you as you drive
And you'll know you got a broadcast straight from 1935
Can you hear him singing
I ain't sittin' in no shack
Got me a Ford right out the back
So come on and roll me over
If I ain't there in nothing flat
With a honky-tonk attitude
I'll be doing the straight line swing
Come on and grab your horseshoe
And throw it in the ring.

A blade of grass in the sand
I knew someone just like you
A wondering eye among us all
We turned to daisy chains
Only where the road bends
Seeing what tomorrow brings
I hear you in the strumming
I hear you in the place I Live
And you my Love I lost to faith
And I lost myself in a long glass
I knew a boy who cut out his pain
But all that flowed was madness

It was may 13th when you told me to wait eh
You were so confused so you needed your space eh
Now your dating Amy and
Too funny everyday
I don't know what kind of games you play baby
But your gonna miss out, miss out, miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no, I'm not waiting
Your gonna miss out, miss out miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no, I'm not waiting for you
So don't come running back no
I'm through with all of that you
I'll never take you back no
Sorry but your gonna miss out, miss out miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no I'm not waiting for you
Ever since you left I found this brand new chick, oh
That is through your lies and won't put up with your shit, no!
So you can come back to Amy and
Too funny everyday
I don't know what kind of games you play baby
But your gonna miss out, miss out, miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no, I'm not waiting
Your gonna miss out, miss out miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no, I'm not waiting for you
So don't come running back no
I'm through with all of that you
I'll never take you back no
Sorry but your gonna miss out, miss out miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no I'm not waiting for you
You made the biggest mistake
When you decided to break my heart
For the dumbest reason in the world
So just remember this lips you'll never taste them again
I hope you know you'll never find another girl
No, no!
But your gonna miss out, miss out, miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no, I'm not waiting
Your gonna miss out, miss out miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no, I'm not waiting for you
So don't come running back no
I'm through with all of that you
I'll never take you back no
Sorry but your gonna miss out, miss out miss out on me
Cause I'm not waiting no I'm not waiting for you

Softly I will leave you softly
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so
Softly, as I leave you there
Softly I will leave you softly
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so
Softly, as I leave you there

Sleeping late, sleeping late
Whenever I sleep late you know I can dream
Some of the strangest things that you've ever seen
I could never tell you the things that I do in my head
Leaving nothing unsaid, sleeping late in my bed
Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sometimes I'm embarrassed by devious thoughts
When I'm undercover let me never get caught
Crazy notions begin with that old devil grin on my face
We're such a disgrace, me and my pillow-case
Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late
The blissful state of sleeping late has been known to compensate
And sometimes even stimulate
I for one appreciate, sleeping late
Ain't it great sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late
Live and in colour, my wildest of dreams
The best ones are re-runs if you know what I mean
I don't believe I can wait for that clock to stop ringing in my ear
It's so lovely here, I may sleep for a year
Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late.....

I'm just trying to stay a human being
Sitting in the sun eating ice cream
Texting my friend about a bad, bad dream
Just had to tell someone who knows me
But I don't got time for this cuckoo clock
And I don't wanna go to your Mason lodge
There's nothing more sad than a lynching mob
Full of rational men who believe in God
But nothing makes sense when the wave rolls through
Nothing makes sense when the wave come through
So it could've been me or it could've been you
Whatever's in me is whatever's in you
My neighbor dreams big 'cause his house is small
Says all he needs now is some capital
It's a pirate world, it's a free-for-all
Just take your bright ideas and they make them dull
Now everyone I see I think I've known before
From the opera house to the grocery store
My love for them I cannot ignore
Like a human voice in a quiet morgue
But I don't wanna wear no dead man's suit
I don't wanna wear no dead man's suit
I don't wanna wait until the moon gets blue
I don't wanna wait until the moon turns blue
It's all just a fix, just one little hit
You'll hold it in
Sitting on a plane chewing Nicorette
Paradise lost, haven't found it yet
Will you talk me down if I get upset?
Be the cool washcloth to my fevered head
Because I don't wanna dream if it won't come true
I don't wanna dream if it don't come true
If there's something in me then I guess it's in you
If there's somewhere in me then I know it's in you
Little baby stone
Well, it's all just a fix, just one little hit
You're holding in, you'll hold it in
You're holding in, you'll hold it in
I don't wanna dream if it won't come true
I don't wanna dream if it don't come true
If there's something in me then I know it's in you
If there's somewhere in me then I know it's in you
Whatever happens to me it's going to happen to you
Whatever happens to me it's going to happen to you

I'm a raisin she's a cow
The way she's looking at me now...wow!
When conversation comes my way
I say I go to church to pray
You know almost every day
That's when she walks away
O Yeah?!
So you want to talk about it for a while
O Yeah?!
So you went school to relearn how to smile
O Yeah?!
She said la de da de dream, she said come on
O Yeah?
Well, O Yeah!
Smoke to mouth and nod your head
I can't remember what you said
And your name again?
Constipation verbally
Then I walk away
O Yeah?!
So you want to talk about it for a while
O Yeah?!
So you went school to relearn how to smile
O Yeah?!
She said la de da de dream, she said come on
O Yeah?
Well, O Yeah!
Sweet candy
Just give me some sweet candy
You make me feel ooh baby
You think you're all that!
O Yeah?!
I want to talk about it for a while
O Yeah?!
Went to school to relearn how to smile
O Yeah?!
She said la de da de dream, she said come on
O Yeah?
Well, O Yeah!
On and on

Days in a dream sleepy and sunny
My lips to your mouth for that sweet taste of honey
Your faith is strong and bullet proof
As my hearth is weak and intoxicated by the spirit of you
Your love is cruel dark as night
You still look so divine when you enter my room in that dandy light
This thing is a crime and some bird might sing
But if connections right we might get away with almost anything
The spirit of you
The spirit of you
What I'm to do
When I'm down by the spirit of you
Days in a dream sleepy and sunny
My lips to your mouth for that sweet taste of honey
Well your faith is strong and bullet proof
As my heart is weak and intoxicated by the
Spirit of you
You
The spirit of you
What I'm to do
When I'm down by the spirit of you
We gonna rise we gonna fall this might be the final call
Well I don't mind
I don't care
I'm not afraid I'm not that scared
As I'm slowly drowning in your arms
I feel bullet proof
And safe from harm any harm
The spirit of you

Get up in the morning
Check out the weather
If it looks like sun
I get my things together
Throw some cutoffs on
Got my tank-top and tennies now
And head for the beach
Well I'm drivin' down the highway
Losin' all my patience
Pushin' all the buttons
Tryin' to find a station
With a screamin' jock
Turnin' out my daily ration of
(cruisin' music, sure good music)
To put the fun back in summertime
I need some cruisin' music to make everything alright
Well I'm flyin' down the freeway
Floatin' like a feather
I've got my windows rolled down
In the hot summer weather
With my radio up loud
Nothing makes me feel better
Than some good rock 'n' roll
(good good, good rock and roll)
Those suntanned girls
Are lookin' outta sight
A beach-drenched chick
Would never get uptight
'cause when the sun goes down
We'll be dancin' through the night and singin'
(cruisin' music, sure good music)
To put the pop back in summertime
I need some cruisin' music to make everythin' alright
It's time you heard some happy music
God knows this world could really use a little sunshine
So won't you make mine
(yeah)
You know I need some more of that
(cruisin' music, sure good music)
To put the fun back in summertime
I need some cruisin' music to make everything alright
(cruisin' music, sure good music)
To put the fun back in summertime
I need some cruisin' music to make everything alright

Scream for me baby!

Where am I
Daytime or nightime?

Scream for me baby!
Look for the answer
Scream for me baby!

When I am high

Scream for me baby!
Look for the answer

Scream for me baby!
Look for the answer
Scream for me baby!
I am the answer
Yeah!
Scream for me baby!

Here we go
Let in the light from my window
Say goodbye to my sorrow
And hello new day
My soul needed a rescue
A hero, it had to be You
I know You've changed everything
So I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love
I've thrown years away
And every chance to change
It took so much to see my pride
I've thrown punches in the air
Chased after love that wasn't there
I know only You satisfy
I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love
Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love
To all the brokenhearted
The crippled and the weak
We are all invited to taste and see
To all of those who are searching
Come find what you seek
It is the truth that we all
Truth that we all need
Everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love
Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love
Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know

Yeah, I want everyone to know
Everyone to know
I want to tell the world about Your love
I want to tell the world about Your love
I want to tell the world about Your love

I'm not a cry baby
I'm the cry baby
A caterpillar that got stuck
Mr. Moth come quick with any luck
A long walk to a dark house
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart
I've got your body doing alright
Hate me baby, maybe I'm a piece of art
Oh, my friends all lie and say
They only want the best wishes for me
Oh, three, two, one
We go live
Oh, baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Whoa, whoa
And oh, baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Whoa, whoa
I can make your heart slow
I can feel the weather in my bones
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like
Your pupils they're big
They're rolling like dice
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, three, two, one
We go live
Oh, baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Whoa, whoa
And oh, baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Whoa, whoa
Not the boy I was
The boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
Not the boy I was
The boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
They say they only want the best wishes for me
(They only want the best for me)
Oh, three, two, one
We go live
Oh, baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Whoa, whoa
And oh, baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Ah
Don't let your love go astray, save it for me
Don't give your sweet kiss away, save it for me
I know you're feelin' blue
'Cause I feel blue like you
I'll be strong as long as you are and wait just as long as you
Don't waste that look I adore, save it for me
Just wait a little bit more, save it for me
I know that you must cry
Cry baby, so do I
Just sit tight and leave on your light
'Cause I'm comin' home to your arms
Oh baby, I'm comin' home to your arms
Ah, save it for me
Ah, save it for me
I know that you must cry
Cry baby, so do I
I'll be strong as you are
And wait just as long as you
Save it for me
Save it for me
Oh, ah
Save it for me
Oh, ah
Save it for me
Oh, ahh
Save it for me
Oh, ah

Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She works for the weekend
Mixtape of her favorite bands
Tearin' up the radio
Lost in the stereo's sound
She's trouble in a tank top
Pretty little time bomb, blowin' up
Take you down, living in the radio
Lost in the stereo's sound
She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Shake down on a Saturday
Sit back, gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her
I know she's gonna take it back somehow
Tattoos and a switchblade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile
Sex in stereo, don't turn the radio dial
She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
And I'm just like cellophane
'Cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay
When I don't even know her name
She's slipping away
She works for the weekend
Mixtape of her favorite bands
Tearin' up the radio
Lost in the stereo's sound
She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

There's a woman in the wardrobe singing Beatles out of tune,
And a salesman in the corner trying to blow up a burst balloon,
And the managing director, he's a-lying on his back,
He's got ice-cream on his trousers and he's planning his attack,
It's just another record company bash,
Nice to know they've got the cash,
You're the only one here I can talk to,
Is there nowhere near we can walk to,
I really want to see you again,
But I don't know your name;
Let's go, let's go home,
Yea, let's go, let's go home,
Let's go, let's get out
The promotion department secretaries are out to kill tonight,
And the A and are director is still looking for his wife,
Oh and there's a party in the bedroom,
They've got the mirror on the floor,
And there's a guy who says he's from Rolling Stone
Who shouldn't be here at all,
It's just another record company bash,
Nice to know someone's got cash,
And they're gonna do something obscene,
With the video machine,
I really think it's time to leave,
Won't you come with me please?
Let's go, let's go home,
Let's go, let's go home,
Grab a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of wine,
It doesn't really matter if it's your place or mine,
Let's go, let's go home

A shadow in the moonlight, here she comes to me,
We sit and talk about it all,
And out in the distance, a dream is over,
All I've been working for;
This is not how I want you to see me,
I have done the best I can,
Now the only thing I believe in,
Is a woman and a man;
You are the reason I'll stay in the fight,
When I can't take it anymore,
You are the reason I wake in the night,
And say that I was only dreaming of it all;
And now in the dawn light, she talks with me again,
Remember all the things we've done,
Been through the bad times, and we've seen through the sad times,
We're stronger than before;
And you picked me up when I was falling,
And you gave me back my pride,
And you listen when I am calling,
And hear the man inside;
You are the reason I'll stay in the fight,
When I can't take it anymore,
You are the reason I wake in the night,
And say that I was only dreaming of it all,
You are the reason I'll stay in the fight.

Seems I just can't do enough
I could never win your love
Why should I try
When you never share your feelings?
How could I be so naive?
Is it so hard to believe
That you excel in emotional concealing?
No matter what I do
I never measure up for you
But you just keep that smile on your face
No matter how much I try
You're never really satisfied
Until you run away and hide
In your perfect world
Where there's no one to blame
No one can hurt your feelings
And you don't feel no pain
Everybody loves you
And nobody gets burned
As long as you are living
In your perfect world
It seems like everyone gets screened
On your answering machine
Can't take the call
And let down your defenses
You can't let anybody see
Your real personality
Is it pride, or just your false pretenses?
Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
But still you wear that smile on your face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you
In your perfect world
Where nothing can go wrong
You're always in control
And we all get along
And everything is beautiful
No need for concern
As long as you are living
In your perfect world
Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
Is it hard to keep that smile on you face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you
Chorus

In this days of hate and division
It's a gift to have someone you can trust
Someone to share every little thing with
The good times, and the daily musts
Right now the sky may seem heavy
But I know the clouds will break up
From here we can only go forward
You and me, we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try.
And when I've been away I've got someone to come home to
You know that means a lot to me
You pick me up when everything is so slow
When I'm knee deep, knee deep in wet concrete.
Right now the sky may seem heavy
But I know the clouds will break up
From here we can only go forward
You and me, we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try
So I'll give it a try
From here we can only go forward
You and me, we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try

I've laid this island sun a 1000 times
I'm on it
But I'm going strange
This island's chills and shell cover me
With winded rock
And skies I've got yet to see
I tried
I even sent in friends
They did it as a favor
Cause I'm not that way
I am the autumn in the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
I land to sail
Island sail
Yeah, we're movin
Yeah, we're movin
This island's sun I've laid 1000 times
Fortune me
Fortune me
Of all my mistakes
I think I lent you late
But I've never seen a scarlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I land to sail
Island sail
Yeah, we're movin'

[Instrumental]

And when I left your place
Gave me your plastic bird
You won it at the festival
Well I broke both legs off
And then I broke its nose
And left it on First Avenue
And when I left your place
Gave me your plastic bird
You won it at the festival
Well I broke both legs off
And then I smashed its nose
And left it on First Avenue

Constantly complain' bout our generation today
Turn around and look you helped to make this way
The less that you've been there the further they stray
And won't believe the things you say
You gotta leave the kids alone
You gotta leave the kids alone
You're acting like a child but your lookin' fully grown
You gotta leave the kids alone
Media been blast deeply thread in our lives
Blowing all our minds causing us to decide
Do we want what they got what they got is it good?
Is it something to trust if we could
If you can't stay together if you can't stay together
Then brother will raise brother and sister will teach sister

Throw it up! woo hoo!
Woo hoo! Woo hoo!
Yeah, yeah woo hoo! yeah,yeah
You're pretty baby,but you know that
Wish I could bring ya
Across the map, yeah
I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Petal to the metal baby hold me tight
Anything you want I can get that girl
If you're with that girl
Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me, baby show me
Roll the windows down let your hair flow
Let it all go tonight
Party people!
Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah, (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah
You drive me crazy, but you know that
Feel the breeze girl, let's take a lap(Yeah)
I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Petal to the metal baby hold me tight
Anything you want I can get that girl
If you're with that girl
Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me, baby show me
Roll the windows down let you hair flow
Let it all go tonight
Party people!
Woo hoo, all the windows down
Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah, (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah

Woo hoo, when I'm rolling through your town (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah (Woo hoo)
Saying yeah yeah
Woo hoo!

Sharp disaster in a fresh new coma.
Was it worth it when it was over?
Proving yourself right, you'd make the biggest noise.
Well, I'd lock my hands behind my head,
I'd cover my heart and hit the deck,
I'd brace myself for the impact if I were you.
It's a long wait for an answer. Is there any news? Is there any word?
Was there trauma? Or a struggle? Am I missing? Or was the body found?
Is there anything worth looking for?
Worth loving for? Worth lying for?
Is there anything worth waiting for?
Worth living for? Worth dying for?
I'm home

Looks like you know what you want
So let go and look over the horizon
Your pirouette will go around the world
Your pirouette will show you the outside
Silently
Coming Home
Silently
Coming Home
Don't bother leaving
We're already gone
True Thoughts retreating
Now it seems they're gone
Don't bother leaving
We're already gone
True thoughts retreating
Now it seems they're gone
Doomsday it's so quiet
You hardly know it's there
Dollars of the triumph
They're loaded down so well
Thunder is expanding
Like your face into the ground
Thunder is expanding
And the rate will wear you down
The best times were better
When you didn't need to think
The eagle or monster
Is pulling down our feet
Let's chase it all we caught
The beast we are free
And don't bother leaving now
We're already gone

I see a swallow perched in front of me
Laughing with her eyes so sullenly
The I see a truck go down the way
No delivery for me today
There's a man upon a little bike
That makes him feel so big he can't decide
If he should give up scraping both his knees
For the sake of being so discreet
So discreet
Before I know it I am far away
The swallow looks so small she can't complain
I don't remember which warm house is mine
So I choose the one whose love is fine
Love is fine

Good morning Mary Ann
And how are you upon this bright
And sunny morning
I hear your brother Ted
Got caught for speeding
But was let off with a warning
I hope he's learnt his lesson
And the next time he goes out will drive with care
It doesn't pay to drive too fast
All it does is make your life last shorter
I know you won't believe this
But it happens to be true
I am a loner
My only real companion is dog I'm very fond of
His name's Homer
He follows me wherever I go
And of course I do my best to feed him
It's not the easiest of tasks
When you consider unlike cats
They're broader
Do what you want to within reason
But remember take your time
Nothing stops for those
Who can't afford to wait
The best advice that I can give you
Is to hold on to your head
And as long as you are good and kind
You'll always be a friend of mine
And it's true to say that a good friend is hard to find
But I'd like to think that you are
A friend of mine
Good morning Sarah Jane
And how are you today
Tell me is that your mother
She looks a lot like you
Though come to think of it
You look like one another
It's funny how with likenesses
Most people have a difference of opinion
They said that I was like my dad
Now they say that I'm just like his daughter
Do what you want to within reason
But remember take your time
Nothing stops for those
Who can't afford to wait
The best advice that I can give you
Is to hold on to your head
And as long as you are good and kind
You'll always be a friend of mine
You'll always be a friend of mine
As long as you are good and kind
You'll always be a friend of mine
A friend in need is a friend indeed
You'll always be a friend of mine

Behind a mask, a man can bask only
For so long before being exposed
To the sun
The moon is up, a whisper of
"'Till death do you wrong"
Patients bother a patient doctor
Plastics itch, and bandages the
Aftermath won't add up to this.
The fever breaks
It would take a masochist
To live like this
I buried my wife today
Restitution for my sanity
Chasing demons dressed like me
Their eyes are not like mine
Ignorance is divine
Instincts are reduced to teeth
That bite the hand that feeds
Fear thy father love thy martyr
The verdict of the jury hung on
The weight of what has become
A starry night, a vengeful wish "it doesn't have to be like this"
I buried my wife today
Restitution for my sanity
I buried my wife today
Restitution for my sanity
Sound the alarm and make
No mistake about this
All the king's horses and all the king's
Men have been sent to put this boy back
Together again, but somehow, he must
Have been predicting the fall
Caged rats, experiments
A brain with no oxygen
Release all the hostages, you've got
To wash your hands of this
Caged rats, experiments
A brain with no oxygen
Release all the hostages, you've got
To wash your hands of this
Murder, murder, murder, murder

There was a time, a simpler time
When a man could be sure of where he stood
I used to work at the yard, working honest and hard
The hours were long but the pay was oh so good
I had a family and friends, oh so many friends
We'd drive to the lake on holidays
Back then it wasn't so dear for a sandwich or beer
At night I still dream I can see their faces
Certain things that you depend upon
There are places that you know
And the faces of america
Oh, where do they go, where did they go
I was born on a farm, a mid-western farm
I rode on the tractor with my dad
And though we never had much it was always enough
And we made the best with what we had
But then came four years of drought and the bottom dropped out
My father was broken like the rest
And I can still see his hands signing over his lands
And the bankers grow fat on the flesh of the dispossessed
Certain things that you depend upon
There are places I can go I sift the ashes of america
For someplace I used to know
Someplace I used to know
Someplace I used to know
There was a time, a simpler time
When a man could be sure of where he stood
I used to work at the yard, working honest and hard
The hours were long but the pay was oh so good
Certain things that you depend upon I used to think were guaranteed
Like the right of every man to work and feed his family
And the faces of america seem so distant and estranged
Have their eyes become too blind to see
How much their hearts have changed
How much their hearts have changed
How much their hearts have changed

Once upon a time, in a land of the sun
Soldiers were dying, under the gun
The people were screaming in a place of no return
With a strike of their hand, they'll make you burn
We know we crossed the line
Cursed by the spell, runnin' out of time
Sending shivers down the spine
Only time will tell, if we'll live or die,
We'll live or we'll die
Run on the edge of tomorrow, cryin' in the rain
Whipping burning chains
Winnin' and losing in pain, is the part of the game
Whipping burning chains
Burning chains
Taking no prisoners, the mob ruled the world
The heroes were falling, died by the sword
Getting rid of all the fools, hidin' bodies in the sand
Heading for tomorrow, to the promised land

Tragic, everybody tryin' to hide all of those habits
It's kinda bizarre when it's who you are
It's tragic that it's come to this
I bury all of my vices tryin' to keep my head up over it
When everything's whatever
It's the be all end all and right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade and you should know
You can tell, it's a
Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along in this?
Bittersweet world
Everybody reapin' what they sow in this sweet world
Whatever happened to the magic that was keepin' us
The faith that was beyond stardust
Now those hypocrites pointing fingers
With three fingers pointing right back
And all we're left with is
And all we're left with is
And all we're left with is
The foolish pride and the quick fixes, yeah
It's the be all end all and right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade and you should know
You can tell it's a
Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along in this?
Bittersweet world
Everybody reapin' what they sow in this sweet world
Bittersweet world
With closets full of skeletons
I'm a bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me as I stand alone
There's a universal bottom line
Everybody's in disguise, even you and I
Behind the facade tryin' to get by
Don't wanna burn but wanna play with fire, again
There's a universal bottom line
Everybody's in disguise, even you and I
Behind the facade tryin' to get by
You wanna play with fire, you're gonna get burned so
It's the be all end all and right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade and you should know
You can tell
It's the be all end all and right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade and you should know
You should know it's a
Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along in this?
Bittersweet world
Everybody reapin' what they sow in this
Bittersweet world
With closets full of skeletons
I'm a bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me as I stand alone

(Originally recorded by Diamond Head)
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil? Yes, I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes, I am
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil? Yes, I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes, I am, ooh
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet
Am I evil? Yes, I am
Am I evil? I am man
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
Am I evil? Yes, I am
Am I evil? I am man
Solo!
My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
Am I evil? Yes, I am
Am I evil? I am man
Am I evil? Yes, I fucking am
Am I evil? I am man

My skin is itching, all I can do is scratch
They keep on niggling, maybe I'm insane
'Cause I refuse it, they nearly got me down
They're shaking their heads, they feel that I'm insane
And does it matter who is right or wrong?
I look for something before I go insane
To be like they say, I lose my something grin
And then I'll know what it is to be insane

life line draggin' me. can't be what i gotta be. forced identity/dismal possibilities. spin me round. shut my eyes. dress me in a dull disguise.

Well I set myself a bedtime this time with a notion
That you try your best then
Everyone wins
But nothing ever goes that smoothly
And it won't end like a movie
Where the good guy always wins
Unitl you figure out
A way that you can live without
Stories with happy ends
Everybody I know is trying to get by
Fighting all the half-true lies
Nobody can win
They fill you up with expectations, innovations and predictions
That can't possibly fly
Cinderella's waiting tables
And the princess never did wake up
That's how it begins

Thus: The Perfect Crime
This is my guilt
This is my curtain

I see you in your office
Sending and recieving checks
But i know the quest for money
Comes from a quest for sex
So i cut to the chase
And forgot about my job
And decided to stay home wit yo mama on my knob
I can see you laughing so i guess you think its funny
But while your getting drunk, I've been gettin honey
And by tommorow night youll be hungover and sick
And ill be at my home wit yo mama on my dick
(Chorus)
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Thinking your the man
Well i am bringing news
Our manhoods being measured by the woman that we choose
And you can't earn respect if all you ever pick is sluts
So ill be staying home to let yo mama suck my nuts
(Chorus)
Eat more fruit, Plant more trees
Learn to shoot, Travel overseas
Wash the dog, Read a book
Find three chinese recipes to cook
Learn to waltz, and speak maltese
Ferment to invent a better feta cheese
The highest they get is number two
Cos number one on my list of things to do
is Yo maaaamaaaaa
Yo maaaamaaaaaa
Yo maaamaaamaaa
Yo mamaaaaa
She's always on top
She's always on top
She's always on top
She's always on top
She's always on top
She's always on top
She's always on top
She's always on top
(techno)
In my dream I was a cop and i stopped to arrest her
Never met a whore more hardcore so i frisked her
Steamed up the beamer and needed the demister
When she licked my colon cleaner than a clyster
Got anotha blista from playin naked twista
Raw on the floor with ya mama and ya sista
Hadn't even kissed her but she still let me fist her
I let her drive home pissed and said
Asta la vista baby
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list
Your mama's on the top of my things to do list

How can they be tired of England?
They'll never know the England that we know
Never know where the ones with dreams go, no
Never notice the skies with their eyes down low
We'll never be tired of England
United in rain in the cities
To channel the pain and the pity's woe
To carry them back to the place below
With the blues, the grays
The green, the brown
To lonely nights uptown
Don't let them bring you down
Lonely nights uptown
Don't let them bring us down, no
How can they be tired of London
The scents in the air on a warm day
Generation of hope that sees better days
But moving along in the same old ways
We'll never be tired of London
From Clerkenwell into the city
The state of the rudes is a pity though
Generations of cramps with their kids in tow
With the blues, the grays
The green, the brown
To lonely nights uptown
Don't let them bring you down
Lonely nights uptown
They'll never bring us down, no
While the queen of England sits on her throne
Of bingo cards and chicken bones
Don't drink yourself to a lonely death
In casinos on crystal meth
Don't drink yourself to a lonely death
In casinos on crystal meth
So sing your song of the Banbury-Cross
Don't breathe a word about your loss
Jack Frost, old Nick to follow down
With cut price cars and top shelf porn
How can they be tired of England?
How can they be tired of England?
How can they be tired of England?
How can they be tired of England?

Did you meet the lady who said she could fly
She broke off her wings when she fell from the sky
The effort was brave and she gave a sigh
Now I'll sail through the sky on my own, my oh my
I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care
When she was a girl she would jump rather high
Then she fell in love with the air and the sky
She discovered her wings and she gave a loud cry
Now I'll sail through the sky on my own, my oh my
I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care
Back to the story
Now she's been repaired and her wings are as new
She's laughing and dancing way up in the blue
But look she has gone, where could she go to?
Her wings were so silver, her halo so new
I can fly through the air
I can fly anywhere
I can fly through the sky
And just see if I care
(repeat)

You say you see no hope
You say you see no reason we should dream
That the world would ever change
You say the love is foolish to believe
'Cause they'll always be some crazy
With an army or a knife
To wake you from your daydream
Put the fear back in your life
Look
If someone wrote a play
To just to glorify what's stronger than hate
Would they not arrange the stage
To look as if the hero came too late?
He's almost in defeat
It's looking like the evil side will when
So on the edge of every seat
From the moment that the whole thing begins
It is love who mixed the mortar
And it's love who stacked these stones
And it's love who made the stage here
Although it looks like we're alone
In this scene, set in shadows,
Like the night is here to stay
There is evil cast around us
But it's love that wrote the play
For in this darkness love can show the way
Now the stage is set
You can feel your own heart beating in your chest
This life's not over yet
So we get up on our feet and do our best
We play against the fear
We play against the reasons not to try
We're playing for the tears
Burning in the happy angel's eyes

I got my stitches stitched, I got my fixes fixed
In my aching heads I got my kisses slipped
Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said, I said
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back
It's true, romance is dead, I shot it in the chest then in the head
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your friend
Because they've got me in a band where I've never seen a heart I couldn't break
It was never about the songs, it was competition
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
I'm casully-obsessed and I've forgiven death
I am indifferent yet (I'm a total wreck)
I'm every cliche, but I simply do it best
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your friend
Because they've got me in a band where I've never seen a heart I couldn't break
It was never about the songs, it was competition
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
(Go!)
I went to sleep a poet, and I woke up a fraud
To calm your nerves I'm feeling for my clothes in the dark
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances

Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
I get hit looking for a miss
I never thought that it would come to this
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Though we may never be the same again
I am so proud that you've been taken in vain
What if none of your dreams come true?
I can never run from you
There's never been a how d'you do
There's never been an ending
Soon you'll belong to someone else
And I will be your stranger just pretending
Moods for moderns
Memory lingers
I let you into
Foreign fingers
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
Moods for moderns
I never thought that would see this day
I never thought that I would give you away
What if none of your dreams come true?
I can never run from you
There's never been a how d'you do
There's never been an ending
Soon you'll belong to someone else
And I will be your stranger just pretending
Moods for moderns
Let them break us
Strong and sudden
Foreign fingers

With history, your bluest grace
Falls apart, cascading down
Speak to me of beautiful hate
Of island chains swept with the tide
Tragedy ripening on
The coral leis of a conquering king
They're swept away
Oh, but not lost
Beneath the waves of trembling stars
The road winds towards
The windward side
My soul is saved by these city lights
My face is framed by the blanket of night
They're swept away
Oh, but not lost
Was I too proud to sat, or to wish for
Words that I knew were forbidden?
Because I don't want to know
I didn't want to see what I saw
When I looked in the distance
They're swept away
Oh, but not lost

Bit my lip
And it's the same thing.
Now I'm reduced to a pulp.
Your undisturbed and decorated
Decorations lie.
You're hounded by pulse
Stabbed by spit
And your brain fits
Despite your ears.
Another one has run in.
Rottin and gossiped,
You're all used up
With a burst up shell. (? )
Why're you gonna try it
If you know you don't like it
How're you gonna give it up
If you ain't got it.
Why're you gonna use it
If you think that it's broke.
Why're you gonna swell the show (? )
The things that you're breaking down, down, down.
Down cold thresh flesh paste
Deliver hate paste.
Voices sick and swelling
You say you don't like it.
You say you don't like it.
But you just don't get it
You just don't get it.
You're hounded by pulse,
Stabbed by spit
And your brain shits
To clog your ears.
A casual mark
Made by a bird.
What you lost
With your fair hands.
Why're you gonna try it
If you know you don't like it.
How're you gonna give it up
If you ain't got it.
Why're you gonna use it
If you think that it's broke
Why're you gonna swell the show
The things that you're breaking down, down, down

I got my self a secret home far beyond the walls of what you may own
I got my self a secret place another fucking waste for the human race
Did you got me all wrong cause I had it for long
It's never that easy
I never had
I never got
I never felt
I never thought
I never blamed myself cause the truth is fucked
I never learn
I never cared
I never shared
I never feared
I never blamed myself cause the truth is fucked
I don't like
I don't think
I don't make
I don't bring
I don't feel a shit cause the truth is fucked
I never learn
I never cared
I never shared
I never feared
I never blamed my self cause the truth is fucked
Cause the truth is fucked

I've gotta big big big heart beat, yeah
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age
To start our own peculiar ways
With good and friendly homes
You get me freaked freaked freaked on preakness
Never met a girl that likes to drink with horses
Knows her Chinese ballet
Must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze
A thing or two at night
Make me sick sick sick to kiss you and I think that I woud vomit
But I'll do that on mondays I don't have a work way
I like it when I bump you an accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lense
I'll hold you don't you go
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet. Hallelujah!
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know...
Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares?
A trapeze is a bird cage even if it's empty and definitely fits the room
And we would too
And my dear dear dear khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Lets just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore
I've gotta big big big big heart beat, yeah
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age
To start our own peculiar ways
With good and friendly homes
Sometimes you're quiet, and sometimes I'm quiet, hallelujah
Sometimes I'm talkative, and sometimes you're not talkative, I know...
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me. Hallelujah!
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. Well, hello...
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you, would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feelin' in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Gotta crush, high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high pop
And you couldn't really know, cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my dos and still feel ill

Billy, he's down by the railroad tracks
Sittin' low in the back seat of his Cadillac
Diamond Jackie, she's so intact
And she falls so softly beneath him
Jackie's heels are stacked, Billy's got cleats on his boots
Together they're gonna boogaloo down Broadway and come back home with the loot
It's midnight in Manhattan, this is no time to get cute
It's a mad dog's promenade
So walk tall, or baby, don't walk at all
Fish lady, fish lady, fish lady, she baits them tenement walls
She won't take corner boys, ain't got no money and they're so easy
I said, "Hey baby, won't you take my hand, walk with me down Broadway
Oh mama take my hand, and walk with me down Broadway, yeah
I'm a young man and I talk real loud, yeah baby, walk real proud for you
So shake it away, so shake away your street life
And hook up to the train
Oh, hook up to the night train
Hook it up, hook up to the, hook up to the train"
But I know that she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
No, she won't take the train
She's afraid them tracks are gonna slow her down
And when she turns, this boy'll be gone
So long, sometimes you just gotta walk on, walk on
Hey vibes man, hey jazz man, oh play me your serenade
Any deeper blue and you're playin' in your grave
Save your notes, don't spend 'em on the blues boy
Save your notes, don't spend 'em on the darlin' yearlin' sharp boy
Straight for the church note ringin', vibes man sting a trash can
Listen to your junk man
Ah, listen to your junk man
Listen to your junk man
Oh, listen to your junk man
He's singin', singin', he's singin', singin'
He's singin', singin'
All dressed up in satin, walkin' past the alley
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Singin', singin', singin' yeah, singin' yeah
(Singin', singin', singin', singin') (Oh yeah)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh, oh yeah
Watch out for your junk man
Watch out for your junk man
Watch out for your junk man
Oh oh ah
Oh oh ah
Oh oh ah
Oh ah, oh ah
Watch out for your junk man

He's like a King without a crown
He wears it like a clown
Watch him disappear
I wish he would come down
So call before you drown
I won't always be around
He's a ship without a sail
He's not listening when you speak
Living for the bottle
He'll be sitting there all week
So call before you drown
I won't always be around
Living for the bottle
Living for the bottle
There's no light on in his eyes
How heavy are the lies
Just jumped right out his skin
He'll take you for a ride
Living for the bottle
Living for the bottle
So call before you drown
I won't always be around
He's a dog without a bite
Still looking for a fight
All in black
He won't be home tonight

Look at all the damage that he's brought upon the earth
His angry body coils in the sand
Stinging poison he spits on the hopeless ones in chains
The blood of all the dead are on his hands
Yes I remember clearly when he had me in his grip
The promises that blossomed into lies
Many still afflicted by the torment of his whip
Not knowing that he'd be there till they die
He said, "I'll exalt myself above the stars of God,
And I will be just like the Most High"
Swollen in rebellion he awoke the wrath of God
And tumbled down like lightning from the sky
A fool in all his glory to think he'd overtake
The One who made the heavens in a day
Spewing accusations out with his tongue of hate
Against the children of the promised way
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, crushing his head!
One day the King of Kings will put him in an endless pit
And lock it up tight for a thousand years
The Alpha and Omega will begin His reign on earth
And crushing into pieces ancient fears
He'll receive all glory high upon His mighty throne
All nations bowing down in reverent praise
tears of joy and laughter will be our new place and home
Our enemy is doomed in a firey blaze!
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, crushing his head!

Ready ready to let you in
Up with the mob
It ain't no accident we're better off
You're set to inherit what I got
You're putty now in my hands
You're bloody now in my hands
Yeah keep the herd in check or be absorbed
Thats all
Yeah that'll happen next and who'll be there to write you off
Bla bla bla

They can walk on water or they can run
Depending on the story
Also by the same author
Volume one, violence death or glory
Sneaking out of the exit of B and Q
With a trolley load of trouble
Polycotton bedsheets some four by two
Petrol and a shovel
They're off to see the wizardry that was
And the fire breathing dragons
Where history can't repeat itself
Because history never happened
Juvenile delinquents are easy prey
To the bigotry and whining
Of a solar ring piece on a dreary day
And when the sun is shining down
On this little mining town
People come from miles around
To see the funny snarling clowns
But not you
You were the one I liked best
You were the grooviest dressed
The only loony left in town
And he was the one who persecuted Jews
And anybody different
He's got a gun that he's not afraid to use
On anybody with them
On the run 'coz he sexually abused
The devils latest signing
The center forward with the Swastika tattoos
Between the hours of twelve and two
The nagging doubts will come to you
Be paranoid parents 'coz they're after your kids
Who don't know what an Aryan master race is
They'll plant the seeds that will grow in time
And start the disease that will poison their minds
Fill them up with hatred and dress them up in robes
You know how the story goes
We've got one Mississippi
Two Mississippis, three Mississippis
Four Mississippis, five Mississippis, six Mississippis burning
We've got seven Mississippis, eight Mississippis
Nine Mississippis, ten Mississippis
Eleven Mississippis, twelve Mississippis
Burning, burning, burning
Burning down on this little mining town
Where people come from miles around
To see the funny snarling clowns
But not you
You were the one I liked best
You were the grooviest dressed
The only loony that's left in town

Raise your family of ghosts and spirits, Sir, we really need to drink from your wine. And yes, your skeletons in the closets (might I bring a few of mine?).
Let's see what we can't see, unlock your books for a change. Glass excavated... bits of china... Mulberry Row scars still remain.
Bones are everywhere, aren't they? Our families spring from their graves. Their Sunday Best don't fit them bones the same way and wine is seeping from
the barrel staves...again.
I'm in your tea room toasting lives unchanged (while music's playing by the garden's edge). Outside rusted joints prove souls asleep can flowers blooms from this vintage? Relative Skeletons nervously shuffle, we glance around community of our own. Quiet valley drips with hints of laughter. Mr. Jefferson, can we slip these bones?
And bones are everywhere, aren't they? What do you think they'd see through those trees? 'Resurrected Spirits Dancing,' you don't say!? (The minstrel's new arrangement of History).
We danced and drank the sun! It over flowed and washed the past away. We roamed! Echo! Laughter! Spirits danced a jig around their graves...
...Then came the rain.
A garden craves a balance of both (I guess so).
From the garden, they're all running from the garden, we're all looking for the garden. So much to maintain.
Bones are everywhere aren't they? Ghosty spirits dash right past me. Finding hidden spaces, favored places. Families disperse to there graves.
Bones are here to stay aren't they? We cultivate the bones that we're of. Sir, if you caught me drunk on wisdom, would you say I've had enough?

Easy lovin', so sexy lookin'
I know from the feelin' that it comes from the heart
Easy lovin', every day's Thanksgivin'
To count all my blessings, I wouldn't know where to start
Every time I look you over
So real-to-life it seems
For upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin', seein's believin'
Life with you's like livin' in a beautiful dream
Every time I look you over
So real-to-life it seems
For upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings

Well it was yoyo, I suppose,
I play like fashion comes and goes.
I can't set my mind on you.
Yes I lied about those lovers,
that they were just some kind of cover
for the nights we used to share.
I've seen this water a lot before,
still I cross it once more.
I shook the hand of the boatman
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt by now
I shook the hand of the boatman
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt by now
There are taking bets,
living all around our bed,
for I can't see my thoughts on you.
And I reduced them to a scratch.
You know, just some pre-fucked-up match
for the nights we used to share.
But I don't believe I care.
I shook the hand of the boatman
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt by now
I shook the hand of the boatman
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt
the bridges I burnt by now
I shook the hand of the boatman
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt
I shook the hand of the boatman
who would take me back along the bridges I burnt

Sunday nights that you want her like velvet cake
Sweet heart can bargain half price mistakes
She will go down with her ship like a good captain
You're sitting on the dock playing for an audience of one
Pacing your apartment, linoleum floors
Get a call from an old friend, she never liked him before
He will drive all over three lanes, you sit tight, shotgun
Windshield wipers waving for an audience of one
You came out from the country wearing mama's clothes
You were born in the city with daddy's domino's
You need a record you can move to, well, we got one
Drop the needle, we are playing for an audience of one
Drop the needle, we are playing for an audience of one
One gets all of you, two's jealous, three gets even less
Four divides you up then you're left pleasing all your guests

Hey uptown girl,
Can you hear this downtown song'
Wrote a couple of words to tell you
Right here is where you belong.
I watch you walk the streets,
Wondering who you're thinking of.
Hope you're looking for someone to hold
And not at all in love.
And I wonder if you can relate
To nights upon my pillowcase
Eyes wide open, middle of the night
You're the last thing on my mind.
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
What nights like these do to me, yeah
I keep asking myself
If our hands were meant to be
I know this town is busy,
But I live on Public Street
We can get out of here
If only for just tonight
Ride like some rolling stone
That's forced to waste your life
And I wonder if you can relate
To nights upon my pillowcase
Eyes wide open, middle of the night
You're the last thing on my mind.
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
What nights like these do to me
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
What nights like these do to me
When I'm under (when I'm under)
Is it me you're thinking of'
With this light (get on your knees)
I pray you're not at all in love.
With someone else (with someone new)
With something other than me and you
Just wanna be where you are (Just where you are)
If ever you're lonely, I won't be far.
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
What nights like these do to me, yeah
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
Only the lonely know
What nights like these do to me

I'm your secret
You're my worst friend
I know, I know
I know the river runs to the sea
All of the time
Still, I keep coming back to land
Come, come
Come again
Karmageddon, my friend
Please come again
I know, I know
The water will support the whale
Though some girl always has a hold of the tail
I think this itch is trying to undo you
Straight off the plane and already swimming inside you
Recall the nights when the morning wouldn't come?
When I stuck you with a tequila bottle until the sun shone through
You swim on to get what you want
Then drunkenly come home singing me a siren song, so...
I'm your secret
You're fair weather
I know, I know
The mountain never ducks for the rain
At any time
I'll never come your way again
Come, come
Come again
Karmageddon, my friend
Don't come again
I know, I know
The water will support the whale
Though some girl always has a hold of the tail
I think you say whatever you need to say to
Get your fuck on and somebody to pay for you
All of those lines and lines and lines and lines
That shot out your mouth and came rearing up behind you
A tidal wave when the water was inside you
I drunk you like a coca-cola when I should have stoned you

Haunted
By your voices
Feel dead
And unconscious
pain and hate become our process
It spreads as he watches
Hatred is contagious
Hatred is contagious
it breaks me
It takes my pride
It makes me
But I am alive
(but I am alive)
crosses
Are our losses
Tombstones
Make our fossils
pain and hate become our bosses
It spreads as he watches
Hatred is contagious
Hatred is contagious
it breaks me
It takes my pride
It makes me
But I am alive
hatred
Is contagious
Hatred
Is contagious
it breaks me
It takes my pride
It breaks me
It's built on lies
It makes me
But I am alive
but I am alive

Well you know Katie Mae is a good girl
Folks say she don't run around at night
WELL YOU KNOW KATIE MAE'S A GOOD GIRL, FOLKS SAY she don't run around at night
Yes, you can bet your last dollar Katie Mae will treat you right.
Well some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I say she got to be a T-model Ford
Yes she got the shape all right, but she can't carry no heavy load.
And she walks JUST LIKE
Her daddy got oil wells in his backyard
Every time she got to working that woman she never has to work too hard.
I say bye-bye poor Katie Mae
These are the last words I got to say
Cause if I don't meet you tomorrow
I'll get you early in the next day.

I met a man with eyes like glass
Whose youthful days were gone and past
He told me in a cardboard tone
How long ago he once had flown
When I was young he did relate
I'd watch the birds as they'd escape
From the greedy ground we grovelled on
Into the clouds and then beyond...
What kind of bird am I?
How can I learn to fly?
And so each day I'd try, he said
To let go of my mind of lead
And with my body floating free
Swim in the air as in the sea
This was my greatest, strongest wish
And so the air did not resist
One day above the ground I rose
And felt the air beneath my toes
What kind of boy am I?
How can I learn to fly?
I rose above the tallest trees
And somersaulted in the breeze
I dove with lightning speed and then
I shot up to the clouds again
I jumped off buildings with delight
And laughed at those afraid of heights
What need has anyone for fear
When we are free and the sky is near?
Oh, what a boy was I?
When do we learn to die?
And when I saw I was alone
And no one close to me would come
I soon forgot the joy of sky
And gently back to earth came I
I've never flown again, said he
Because we're all alike, you see
Our sameness strengthens unity
And no one needs to question me
What kind of boy was I?
How could I learn to fly?

She never thought that she would
Get her second chance
Running so far from all she's ever known
Convinced she's lost all meaning
Where did her dreams go
Still she knew that there was something more
Don't be scared, there's someone there
To say these words you need to hear
Don't let anybody tell you who you are
It's OK to let go, you're that shooting star
Remember all you wished for
Believe it will be true
You will never find yourself anywhere else
You'll find yourself in you
Sometimes people tell you
Be like me to fit in
Do you know your identity is not in them
Don't be scared, there's someone there
To say these words you need to hear
Don't let anybody tell you who you are
It's OK to let go, you're that shooting star
Remember all you wished for
Believe it will be true
You will never find yourself anywhere else
You'll find yourself in you
Why should I measure the world
By someone else's design
Oh I won't let this fly by
Hey look over here I just found the real me
Now it's your turn to see
Now it's your turn to see
Don't let anybody tell you who you are
It's OK to let go, you're that shooting star
Remember all you wished for
Believe it will be true
You will never find yourself anywhere else
You'll find yourself in you

Sprinkle patterns in your daydreams, the world seems so much brighter
You've only seen them once or twice but you wonder what's inside them
Your dream could come true, you know, just test the water
Before you heave your boots and go, you better think this over
God bets you leave them, God bets you lie
God bets you never get another chance, God knows why
God bets you leave them, God bets you lie
God bets you never get another chance, God knows why
Your mind is full of ifs and maybes, you don't know which way to go
You're falling down and standing up but you're not going home
Your dream could come true, you know, just test the water
Before you heave your boots and go, you better
God bets you leave them, God bets you lie
God bets you never get another chance, God knows why
There's a place where everyone is difficult
It's a human downfall we are guilty of
It's the things inside us that are typical
God knows why
God knows why
God knows why... you kill
You kill

Will you think of me in time
It's never my luck so never mind
I want to say your name but
The pain starts again
It's never my luck so never mind
I had a dream that you with me and
It wasn't my fault you rolled me over
Flipped me over a somersault and that
Doesn't happen to me I've never been
Here before I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
Will you wait for me in time
It's never my luck so I'll say never mind
I lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push til the pushing' goes from hurting' to burnt
I always take them to that place
I thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing 'around this
Clown commands applause at his show
I had a dream that you with me and
It wasn't my fault you rolled me over
Flipped me over like a somersault and
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never and
I stood outside her heaven her heaven
Inside her heaven her heaven
I can only dream of you and
Sleep that I never see sunlight
Again I can try to be with you but
Somehow I'll end up just losing a friend and
I can only reach for you relate to you
I'm losing my friend where did she go where
I had a dream that you with me
It wasn't my fault you rolled me over
Flipped me over a somersault and
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before but I saw forever
In my never and I stood outside her heaven
I stood outside her heaven I stood outside her heaven
Wont you let me into your heaven

Wakin' up on Monday mornin'
Sunday'd been and gone
Reachin' out for you
But I was alone
Now I sit at the breakfast table
Table's set for two
Been the same thing ev'ry morning
Silly things I do
Ooh, don't know what to do about you
I'll never could give the way you gave
Ooh, now should I try to find you
Keep playin' ev'ry song you played me
Feel like breakin' up again
It's a thing I gotta live with
Take it on my own
I'm waitin' till it's over
Then again I never know
If I'd only seen you goin'
Walkin' out the door
But I had no way of knowin'
Can't take it no more
Ooh, don't know what to do about you
I'll never could give the way you gave
Ooh, now should I try to find you
Keep playin' ev'ry song you played me
Feel like breakin' up again

You were once with me
But you decided to turn
Now my jealousy
Is a fire that burns
To the core of me
When will I ever learn?
I could walk away
But that wouldn't be like me
I could turn my face
But then I couldn't see
You coming back to me
I'm waiting for that day
I've got a great big problem
You can't ever get to the bottom of
My love, no matter what you do
I can't let you go
I've got a great big problem
You can't ever get to the bottom of
My love
I can't let you go
You refuse to be
The one I meant for you to be
If you could only see
How this is killing me
You'd come back to me
I would set you free

Say behave it's okay to be this way
We're beginning to be fly
And the wind connects you
Boy it's the fattest thing I've had
I cannot be able to move on
I won't lead you into me
It's just something that I'm knowing
Clearly this is the place
Up here in outer space
It's so clear
It's so fly
And the fattest thing that I've had
It's okay being this way
I won't lead you into me
But I'll be patient
This seems the place before us
It's fair it's so live
The fattest thing I've had
It's okay being this way
It's so big

All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
It's the 'cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to die for
It makes me want to run out shaking
I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something we can do without
If men are only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?
Just keep quiet, no room for doubt
I'm hearing talk of joy in labor
I'll tell you this you can leave me out
The motherland's no place to cry for
I want some sand to hide my head in
I'm hearing talk of strength in labor
That's something I can do without
If I'm only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt
Just keep quiet, no room for doubt
All this talk of blood and iron
It's the cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to cry for
It makes me want to run out shouting
I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something I can do without
If men are only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?
Just keep quiet, no room for doubt

There were wonderful moments
When I thought I was free
I would walk through the tall grass
Let the [Incomprehensible] pull at me sometimes
I would plead, back in the car I would listen
To the sound of the engine sing
No matter how old you are
An old song can still make you think of him
How it used to be
Sitting alone at the table
There were times when I could not breathe
I see your ghost in the corner
He never speaks so I have to ask him
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
You should turn and go back home
Do you really want to take on this heart of stone?
There were wonderful moments
When I thought I was free
There were wonderful moments
When I thought I was free

Over and over
I get to know myself
Over and over
There ain't nobody else
Imperceptible the lines I draw to you
It kills to watch you love another
I should have known better
When I caught you wild
You were incredible
Never knew you like I know you now
You are illegible
Imperceptible the lines that form the screw
It kills to watch you love another
Over and over
I get to know myself
Over and over
There ain't nobody else
A receptacle of lies
Construed to waste your time
It kills to watch you love another
Over and over
I get to know myself
Over and over
There ain't nobody else
Imperceptible the lines
Construed to waste your time
It kills to watch you love another
It kills to watch you love another
It kills to watch you love another

Movin' to the secret so clandestine

I smash fists
Into my face
I feel it
This is good.
This is good.
This is good.
This is good.
I punch the wall
With my fists
I feel it
This is good.
This is good.
This is good.

Way out there in the wilderness
Of love and pain
Under the gentle arches we rode
The silver streets
Couldn`t see a difference between gold or
Wooden cross
Could never see where we`re falling
Came in to love
Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was
Never was there once nothing
And everything once was
Not dead but still and ready to be born anew
Looking back now it all
Seems so clear
Like staring so long unseeing for someone to light inside a
Darkened room
Then try your tender love
Push you back till there`s nowhere left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes to get home and have a love again
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes
To get home and have a love
Then try your tender love
Push it till there`s nothing left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Then only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was

It's been a long time comin'
But I think I've got it figured out
Sometimes the easiest things are still
The hardest ones to learn about
Well I was strugglin' so hard for my freedom
And it was there all the time
But I just couldn't see it
I think I found myself
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
Well I got sidetracked somewhere
Though I really can't recall just when
I lost my inspiration
And I couldn't get it back again
(No)
I trusted everyone else so completely
Well I was deaf, dumb and blind
But I'll be damned if I'll let 'em defeat me
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I'm tired of tricks and politics
And futures burning bright
I'm on the line and out of time
For once in my life
I'm gonna do what I think is right
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I think I found myself
I think I found what I'm lookin' for

Gone with the wind and home is far away from me
There's no one way to see
Haunted by ghosts the evil force of mystery
No way out for you and me
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
(They're) searching for the stars they couldn't find
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
(They're) searching for the stars they couldn't find
Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
They found shelter in the temple of the holy
Don't touch the magic wall, the sign of the crystal ball
See their faces in the mirror
They're the legions of the damned from an unholy land
Bringing fear and reign of terror
The end of the time, (they're) the end of the line
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
The end of the time, (they're) the end of the line
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy
Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy

[Whore #1:] Hi girls, how's business?
[Whore #2:]

Yeah, if you go down to Athens, G-A
And you're driving in your car
You won't get very far before
You hear people shoutin' out!
What's that?
Butterbean! Yeah!
Gramps and grannies
Kids in their teens
Junkyard dogs and campus queens
Yeah, everybody likes butterbeans
Don't you wait, don't you linger
Butterbean don't slip through my fingers
Pass me plate full, I'll be grateful
1-2-3-4
Pick 'em, hull 'em, put on the steam

Come here you little butterbean you come on!
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean grows on the vine
Some people are fat, some people are lean
But I want you to show me the person
Who doesn't like butterbeans
Yay!
Well, you can have your yams
You can have your collard greens
But if you want to please little ol' me
You better fix butterbeans
Don't you wait, don't you linger
Butterbean don't slip through my fingers
Pick 'em, hull 'em, put on the steam
That's how we fix butterbeans
(Fix 'em hot hot hot)
(Yeah, make 'em jump outta the pot)
Fix 'em for me now

There's a traffic jam outside my window
There's a red light on that just won't change
The pavement's full of cracks from all the sunshine
But now they're filling up 'cause the rain is falling down
I'm running round in circles
Trying to find my way
It's a slow day without you
It's a slow day when you're not around
It's a slow day with no escape
It's a slow day without you
There's a jet-plane up there hanging in the sky
Just kind of resting his wings on that big white cloud
Minutes taking on but stretching out forever
Just like the rooftops out there - they all melt together
I'm running 'round in circles
Trying to find my way
24 long hours with nothing to do
24 long hours just hanging on, waiting for you
It's gonna be a slow day

She haunts the roads
She waits for a new face
The arms red and injured
She wants to rise
She can't till we have faced
I'll cut your armies down
And turn your heart
You wait, I'll wait
I'll lie awake for you
I'll cut your armies down
And turn your heart
You wait, I'll wait
I'll fly away
I'll break
Down

Are you putting in your songs?
No, I'm not when you ask
Nope
Kind of I yes
Hollywood girl, is lost again
All of her hopes left her stranded
Seasoned dreams are just pretend
And she can't stand it
Why'd it have to happen to me
Why'd it have to hurt so bad
'Cause in this town
Can't find up but I found down
In the city life
Can't turn around
Can't give up I feel too proud
Under the city lights
She doesn't believe, in believing
Miracles have died in her mind
She knows the world, is deceiving
Everything is wastin' her time
Why'd it have to happen to me
Why'd it have to hurt so bad
'Cause in this town
Can't find up but I found down
In the city life
Can't turn around
Can't give up I feel too proud
Under the city lights
Get in line and hold your head high
Pretty face will help you get by
Step inside I'll make your tears dry
So put on your smile
Ha! 'Cause in this town
Can't find up but I found down
In the city life
Can't turn around
I can't give up I feel too proud
Under the city lights
One of the drivers has to pick you up at the airport
And bring you to my photo shoot so I can see you
I'm so sorry, I tried to get it changed
I'm so sorry baby
Don't be mad

And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape
Ooh?

The city's burning me out
It's time to make tracks
Let's hit the highway
And never look back
Just you and me
Take care of ourselves
Don't have to answer to anyone else ...
Cool love
It makes me feel good
It's all that I want
Cool love
It feels like dancing on the edge
Of a knife
Oh yes, I'm having the time of my life ...
Cool love
Before I met you
I was just doing time
My heart on ice
No love on line
But when I saw your face
I saw a new way out
I know you know
What I'm talking about

Well I miss you baby
I gotta get back home to you
Well I miss you baby
I gotta get back home to you
I've seen a million women
Only one of them will do
Well I'm east of somewhere
You know what I mean
Well I'm west of nowhere
And all points in between
Up or down
North or south
Right or wrong
I'm inside out
Gotta get back
I know you're cryin
Cryin for your man
Baby, I'm tryin
Tryin hard to understand
Another turn, the rubber burns
No one else is my concern
I gotta get back
Well I miss you baby
I gotta get back home to you
Well I miss you baby
I gotta get back home to you
I've seen a million women
Only one of them will do

A mutinous enemy carved a nascent country
Sweat, blood, and valor
Forms the grit of our history
Bequeathed to everyone:
Chance and free expression
Substance was restrained
And the spirit was broken
I feel a strange denial
Rhythmic as a change
Constance as time
Lonely
Insistent whispers
Somber as a wave bye bye
Searching for solution, without constitution
Black coats by our sides
Promising salvation
Advocating dogma as tickets to hereafter
Mortals in their prime
With their desperate hands in the air
Daunting
Complex and burning
Rythmic as change
Constant as time
Conflicts
Craving approval
Weighted as a murder trial
Oh I feel a strange denial
Correct is Consensus
Everything else, nonsense
Forward is the hope
Forget recompense
Peace and tranquility is only for the wealthy
Dearth for the masses
And inequality
I feel a strange denial
Rhythmic as change
Constant as time
Lonely
Insistent whispers
Dissipating in the night
Like a lone forgotten light
And no one is helping me
It's a strange denial

Waking up in pieces
On Monday noon
I'm a burdon to myself
Gonna to crack real soon
My armour, my shield
The food for my greed
I thought I knew when it was time to quit
But only in my mind
Guess you don't know your own kind
Guess I failed to walk along
My tactics were just wrong
Only in my mind
I'll make it the next time
Don't tell me the stories
Bring out the wine
Turn on your ecstasy, ecstasy
Bring out the wine
Bring out my enemy, my enemy
Thought I made mistakes
That I had a full view
If you had your doubts
I'd beat the hell out of you
Your cheering smiles
Were hatred in disguise
You didn't dare to pay the price
But it was only in my mind
Guess you don't know your own kind
Guess I failed to walk along
My tactics were just wrong
Only in my mind
I'll make it the next time
Don't tell me the stories
Bring out the wine
Turn on your ecstasy, ecstasy
Bring out the wine
Bring out my enemy, my enemy

Life is good, I can't complain
I mean, I could but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good, good, good
Now I'm rolling my window down
I love the wind, but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good
Like a roller coaster ride
Holding on by knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
(Can't believe I'm like)
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
In the morning it begins again
Feels like I'm falling, better strap me in
I think I'm running out of oxygen
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good
Like a roller coaster ride
Holding on by knuckles like
Whoa, whoa
(Can't believe I'm like)
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
Whoa, whoa
(Got me feeling like)
My inhibitions are weakening to like the whole situation
I can't help but lose control
No inner friction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
Like a roller coaster ride
Like I'm burnin' up the light
Like I'm 'bout to trip inside
This summer night makes me feel like
Whoa
Like a roller coaster, whoa
Holding on by knuckles, whoa
Won't you let your love in? Whoa
Every inch of me is like
Whoa
Got me feeling like

I got on my wheels
And I went out on the town draggin'
I hit a big oak tree
It looked like a wreck to the wagon
I got a hospital bill
And the judge waitin' for me to pay
I had a sweet little honey
Just two six packs away
I told the judge there was two trees
And I went 'tween 'em
(Two six packs away, yeah)
He said, from what I hear your condition
That's the way that you seen 'em
(Two six packs away, yeah)
He laid down a hammer
And he gave me ninety long days
I had a sweet little honey
Just two six packs away
Well, I'm workin' on a country road
But it's sunny weather
It's gonna take a while
To put my wheels back together
Now Sunday rolls around
That's my cigarette day
And my baby's still a waitin'
Just two six packs away
When I get out of this place
And don't say I never saw one
(Two six packs away, yeah)
Goin' down to Joe's
And have that big bartender draw one
(Two six packs away, yeah)
For my throat is dry
And my mouth feels like clay
And my baby is a waitin'
Just two six packs away
And my baby is a waitin'
Just two six packs away
And my baby is a waitin'
Just two six packs away

This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean
Way above the clouds I come stealin'
Feelin' tired, but I feel good
Cause I did everything I said I would
I think of you
And I know how you'll be feelin'
I gotta see you
I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you everyday
Way up here above this timeless sea
I realize just what it is you mean to me
You give me somethin' when I thought that everything we had was dyin'
I need a reason just to make me carry on
Well I know better now
I know where I belong
I can't imagine how I ever let myself just give up tryin'
I gotta see you
I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday
Oooooh, yes home and dry
Ain't nothin' up here gonna slow me down
You know I never had to take the long way 'round
I think of you
'Cause I know how you'll be feelin'
This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean
Way above the clouds I come stealin'
I gotta see you
I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you everyday
Oooooh, yes home and dry

I traced the footsteps through the multi-colored avenues
That wind their way down to the sea
I see the birds that fly beneath the darkened sky
They are the messengers of dreams
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me
Pages filled with science fiction
Without fear of contradiction
Walking through the fields of evergreen I see a turn and walk away
And from the east there comes a breeze that flows up high into the blue
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me
The sound of retribution
In total disillusion, Mandalay
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me
Amidst the confusion
The only conclusion
Mandalay of the misty eyes
Have gazed into the coming door
The leaves that turn to gold and brown
I've watched them falling to the ground
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me

Relationship lost on a stormy sea
I hold on to you
Just hold on to me
When the lighting strikes
You hear the thunder roaring
And you don't know how long
This will go on
But I know I still love you
And I know you still care
So keep on tryin'when you're sure you still love me
I don't know much
But I know how to love you
doesn't that mean anything
I don't know much
But I know how to love you
A sea of love
don't let it drown us
We?re way too far from shore
As we go deeper
As the wind grows stronger
It tries to tip us over
But we both learned how to swim
So let?s just go on
'Cause I know I still love you
And I know you still care
So keep on tryin'when you're sure you still love me
I don't know much
But I know how to love you
doesn't that mean anything
I don't know much
But I know how to love you
Yeah I know I still love you
And I know you still care
I don't know much
But I know how to love you
doesn't that mean anything
I don't know much
But I know how to love you
And that's all I need to know...
For now

Please, hear me call out loud
Hear me scream this out
It's the only thing you'll hear
In a town so cold, in a figured soul
You will figure out when you hear
Space is all you've got
You really only get one chance
You really only get one love
You really only get one fear to fall
If you wanna go alone
Then it's all on you
And the ghosts control
Here, with your fingers cold
And the shades of roads
That won't take you home
You really only get one chance
You really only get one love
You really only get one fear to fall
You really only get one wish
You really only get one life
You really only get one time to fly
Space is all you've got
Space is all you've got
You really only get one chance
You really only get one love
You really only get one fear to fall
You really only get one wish
You really only get one life
You really only get one time to fly
To fly

I hope I find a noble death and avoid an angry trigger
I guess I'll find my ripe old self or at least that's what I figure
The sour breath of a disappointed girl daring the man who could keep her
She was born by the name of Lynn but she went by Honey Creeper.
The bones of an old life call
They tear at the threads of my innards
Somewhere something went wrong
Now I'm living with ghosts and with sinners
It must have been 1929 when I took my turn to hold her
I felt a longing that I couldn't quit express and by fault I never told her
I'm an old man that's what I am like and old stump in the ground
You can't find a man who doesn't want to be found
I'm an old man that's what I am that's what I've come to know
I became a shadow when I let that woman go.

It didn't have to be obscene
To stop my heart with fantasy
It's beautiful, but
All I want is you
It didn't have to be so complete
You could have left
Some room for Mystery
When I turn out the light
All I see is you
I can hardly wait
In the place where
I've been waiting
From the start
Will I find a place to
Stop my heart
You didn't have to be so mean
You could have held me as I
Searched for meaning
When I reach for the sky
All I see is you
You didn't have to be so cold
When I look in the mirror
I feel so old
It's all meaningless
But I believe in you

Take more than you give me
I can
taking it, after all these years
Close my mind to suffering
I will
Open my mind to all that's right
Making me
Making me hurt
Making me hurt so bad I feel it
No tolerance
No tolerance
Overcome this hatred
I can
Doing it after all these years
I see myself growing
I will
Knowing the man that I can be

What must I do
How can I serve you
Is it true what I do is the way to be near you
I'm listening, though sometimes I can't hear you
Looking around fills me with wonder
At the way you can keep this old world running smoothly
Thinking of you always seems to soothe me
I know you're probably not a man or a woman
Or a time or a season
But I'm here, and life is dear
And I guess that's a good enough reason
To say
Just let me do
What you put me here to
Let me be what you want me to be
And I hope it'll cheer you
I'm listening, and I think I can hear you

THE THIRD MAN
(Bobby Helms - Teddy Wilburn - Frances Heighton)
'65 Tree Publishing
Last night I dreamed I took a walk up Calvary's lonely hill
The things I saw with my own eyes could not have been more real
I saw upon three crosses three men in agony
Two cried out for mercy and the third man he looked at me
And oh the hurt in this man's eyes that just broke my heart in two
It seemed I could hear him say son I'm doing this for you
I knelt beneath the third mean's cross and slowly bowed my head
I reached out to touch his feet and it stained my hand's with red
And when I heard him cry in pain I raised my eyes to see
The blood spilled from the third man's side and some of it spilled on me
The third man wore a crown of thorns spikes held him to the tree
And I heard him say oh my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me
And there within a mighty crowd the ones who mocked him cried
King save Thyself if thou art King and then the third man died
Suddenly I heard the thunder roll I saw the lightening pierce the sky
The third man was still hanging there and I began to cry
I saw the boulders fall and heard the breaking of the ground
Then I awoke and though I dreamed I touched my cheek and found
My eyes were wet where I had cried a dream I wished I knew
I still can hear the third man say I'm doing this for you

In God they believe - hate & war
A crusade of men
Killing is wrong - hate & war
For the Church it's OK
Death toll - on the rise
No one cares, no one cares
Shot and beaten is the way of man
Torture and knifed - who will be next?
Worked to death by the ones you respect
Hate & death & war
Attak on democracy - hate & war
It's an invasion
We take a country - Hate & war
It's liberation
Death toll - on the rise
No one cares, no one cares
Shot and beaten is the way of man
Torture and knifed - who will be next?
Worked to death by the ones you respect
Hate & death & war
Death toll - on the rise
No one cares, no one cares
Shot and beaten is the way of man
Torture and knifed - who will be next?
Worked to death by the ones you respect
Hate & death & war
Death toll - on the rise
No one cares, no one cares

Well the work whistle blew about a half past five o'clock.
I saw the red light on the corner, man I never tried to stop.
Got pulled over by a man in blue.
He said "What the hell you tryin'a do?"
I told him 'bout my baby, he let me go, thanks a lot.
Got invited to a party at a high school Hollywood pool.
There were women all around me, man I began to drool.
I weighed the evidence at hand,
I said "Girls you gotta understand,
Since I met my baby I've been livin' by the Golden Rule."
Aw, there ain't nobody gonna make me shout.
Ain't nobody gonna put me out.
Ain't nobody gonna make me do
Like my sweet little Lisa does.
Ain't nobody gonna make me sing.
Make me do the wrong damn thing.
I'm sinking my head in a cold cold stream
Like my sweet little Lisa do.
I was hauling out of Dallas, got pulled over by a debutante.
She was playing with her gearshift, I was being kinda nonchalant.
Said she'd take me up to her room,
Keep me following with the Lorna Doones.
I got a sweet sugar mama gonna give me everything I want.

Post office clerks put up signs saying "position closed"
And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats
And Janitors padlock the gates
For security guards to patrol
And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink
While the married ones turn on a chat show
And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
Gentlemen time please you know we can't serve anymore
The traffic light change to stop when there's nothing to go
And by five o'clock everything's dead
And every third car is a cab
And ignorant people sleep in their beds
Like the doped white mice in the collage lab
And nothing ever happens
Nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song
And we all sing along like before
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there
The Martians could land in the car park and no one would care
Close circuit cameras in department stores
Shoot the same movie every day
And the stars of these films neither die or get killed
Just survive constant action replay
And nothing ever happens
Nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song
And we all sing along like before
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
And bill boarding advertise products that nobody needs
While angry from Manchester writes to complain about
All the repeats on TV
Computer terminals report some gains
For the value of copper and tin
While American businessmen snap up Van Goghs
For the price of a hospital wing
And nothing ever happens
Nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song
And we all sing along like before
And nothing ever happens
Nothing happens at all
The'll burn down the synagogues at six o'clock
And we all go along like before
And we'll all be lonley tonight and lonely tomorrow
And we'll all be lonley tonight and lonely tomorrow

Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream
While the children play in the field
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life
But how strong is the shield?
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground
Where sky is forever blue
So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud
Which may take me from you
Many things a man can lose
His self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb
To the hill up above
Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield
So trust in you love, and Lucy of above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground
And to his wish he will yield
Fate will have it's word, of course
(Think this line is wrong)
And time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield

We fight on the back of the discontent,
Not for what you think is best.
We fight on the back of the discontent.
Who'd of thought you'd listen
To the things we've got to say.
And who'd have thought that we'd still care
With the passion of yesterday.
It was you before who insisted,
That we'd all have to change.
'Cause there's no room for real conviction,
In the cool, craze, new today.
But we're breakin', 'cause it's not the first time,
That we're takin', it wont be the last time,
That we're breakin', 'cause it's not the first time,
That we're takin', it wont be the last time.
We fight on the back of the discontent,
Not for what you think is best.
We fight on the back of the discontent,
We're fighting over...
We're fighting for everything,
Everything we got to say.
And our past songs,
Are still everything we are today.
Let's go!
It's everything we are today.
Who'd of thought you'd listen
To the things we've got to say.
And who'd have thought that we'd still care
With the passion of yesterday.
It was you before who insisted,
That we'd all have to change.
'Cause there's no room for real convictions,
In the cool, craze, new today.
'Cause we're breakin', and it's not the first time,
And we're takin', it wont be the last time,
That we're breakin', 'cause it's not the first time,
That we're takin', it wont be the last time.
Mr. Music.
'Cause it's not the last time.

I'm a motherfucker because I don't give a fuck!
Yow, ow! what the fuck is up!
Yeah, I'm a motherfucker 'cause
I don't give a fuck!
Yo, my man, what the fuck is up?
What the fuck is up? what the fuck is up?
What the fuck is going on in this town?
Big bloody wallet full of snakes
Goddam cupcakes on fire
Goddam cheesecake in my jeans!
(aw, save that for later)

Walked home in the rain today
Took the subway train today
Went to my room, listened to Billie Holiday
Stared down to broadway
Took the bus home today
Had a staring contest with a guy I did not know today
Out stared everyone on the bus today
Took it home to Broadway
I don't care if you don't understand
I will be there anyway
Just found out what to be today
See it through
I don't care if you don't understand
I will be there anyway
Just found out what to be today
See it through

Take away my inhibitions
Take away my solitude
Fire me up with your resistance
Put me in the mood
Storm the walls around this prison
Leave the inmates
Free the guards
Deal me up another future
From some brand new deck of cards
Take the chip off of my shoulder
Smooth out all the lines
Take me out among the rustling pines
Till it shines
Like an echo down a canyon
Never coming back as clear
Lately I just judge the distance
Not the words I hear
I've been too long on these islands
I've been far too long alone
I've been too long without summer
In this winter home
Still if we can make the effort
If we take the time
Maybe we can leave this much behind
Till it shines
See the rich man lost and lonely
Watch him as he dines
Sitting there just testing all the wines
Till it shines

Believer (what's up)
Believer (what's up)
In a minute, everything you have can all be straight gone
In a minute, things you thought were tied can come straight undone
How about some knocks on wood, some so far, it's so good, any day
What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south, that's what plates are about
Nature has no conscience, no kindness, or ill will
But the dreams they had make me sad because of the vibes of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family, my bros and I were driving The RV bleeding flames, us leaping through fire, surviving
Zoned with no home, there was fire all on it
Umm, let me have my life, I want it
(I'm gonna.) [Repeat: x4]
I'm gonna let you know that I said
We're comin' in kill, we're comin' in chill
We're comin' in how we will
Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal
And I say know no critical border 'cause
We do what we want
Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font
[Chorus:]
Not one to get over sounding like the norm Friendly to the radio, all that shit is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain't no thing
Omaha Stylee, did not think there was one
Where you know the radio's weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we fuck up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
Still we're down like that x3
Makin' the funk that smells of skunk
Omaha Stylee, did not think there was one
Where you know the radio's weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we fuck up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
The dance hall that we come from was a pool table basement
The fun was low key, and the records were, too, major fun
Such occasions occur back in the day
It begins, you're a raw kid all the way
Son of a gun, but there you drifted
All are endowed but few are gifted
At the break of dawn behaving like a spy
Lampin' in the light the cold world awakens
Deeper is the light to open up the sky
Look into my eyes and see them dilatin'
Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with, man
Embedded in our souls, it breathes out from this band
We always knew that we could
Thank you if you, too, felt we would
We will arise, explore these worlds and find the grassroots
How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude, on the one, come off like Teflon
Rock your shit and you will rise on If you're a farmer out standing in your field say (uh)
Do as you will do as you wish follow your bliss say (uh)
We travel 'round the country, giving it our best
We like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest
The hammer and the chisel and the rule and conquest
We forged the sword, the chariots of war, our battle axe
There's much power in anger, but love's a bigger banger
Complete props to my crew
'Cause this is how we do
Omaha Stylee

The obvious heart has come to collect
'Cause it tore apart like a tortured insect
The obvious heart waits here to heal
And balances out a subtle reveal
'Cause there's a remedy close
In a familiar dose
This bitter pill to swallow
Is last in the bottle tonight
You're empty it's alright
And full of yourself
No need to explain
To anyone else
Broken in time
Taken what's left
No need to deny
The cause or effect
This heart is not a broken one
But where have all the colors gone
It's still among the lucky ones
This heart is not a broken one
But where have all the colors gone
You're still among the lucky ones
And burning longer than the sun
'Cause there's a remedy close
In a familiar dose
Now you can find out who knows
Soaking the truth that she says
In taken chances

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow
The horror that he brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow
Our minds will be his toy
And every girl and boy
Will learn to be employed by
The Black Widow
Love me, yes, we love me
(Love him, yes, we love him)
Love me, yes, we love him
He sits upon his throne
And picks at all the bones
Of his husbands
And his wives he's devoured
He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene
At the virgins and the children
He's deflowered
Love me, yes, we love me
(Love him, yes, we love him)
Love me, yes, we love him
Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our brains are webbed in haze
Of mindless senseless daze of
The Black Widow
These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow
The Black Widow

Hey, hey it's the tall sail on a beach, reach for Java
Make way for to Java watching for Boogies
Hey, hey, it's a dreaming, I would burn you if you should die
Hey, hey, I should burn too if you should lie upon that bamboo pyre
I dream of Amlapura, never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura, of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
Hey, hey, golden roses around a rajah's mouth
Hey, hey, all the dead children buried standing
A flying dutchman, smoking gun and spice wind
I dream of Amlapura, never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura, of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone

I think you're coming around again
Your psychic told you that she thinks it's the end of the line
You put on that smile again
And somehow forget you were ever a friend of mine
These days I'm amazed by the changes in you
'Cause this time you decide you don't like the truth
Don't throw in the towel and give up on me now, what can I do?
You're dying to live, you're dying to know what love is
And I'm trying to show you something more
Now you're watching the sky
For a top gun falling out of the blue sometimes
You wish you could hide
From this nightmare you swear is becoming your everyday life
I know you don't show you're not doing so well
It's okay 'cause today there's a way out of this
Take my hand if you can and we'll drive all night
You're dying to live, you're dying to know what love is
And I'm trying to show you something more
You're dying to live, you're dying to know what love is
And I'm trying to show you something more
You ask me the question
Starin' out the window with the memory runnin' down your face
Is there more to this maybe?
Than dancin' for pennies in the street like a gypsy girl, baby
You're trying to lie about why you're down and out
Can't you see that it's me you're pushin' around
When will you be still and take your chances with God?
She's music to my eyes
She lives in paradise, but somethin' isn't right
She thinks she's goin' blind, but it's just dark outside
Trippin' along under pale street lights
I can't believe she says that everything's fine
She's the luckiest girl alive, she's the luckiest girl alive
What a lucky world
You're dying to live, you're dying to know what love is
And I'm trying to show you something more
You're dying to live, you're dying to know what love is
And I'm trying to show you something more

Are you still talking to
All of those dead film stars
Like you used to
And are you still thinking of
All of those pretty rhymes
And perfect crimes
Like you used to love
And if you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Shall I kill you like you asked me to
If you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Shall I kill you I know you told me to
But I really don't want to
I remember all of the thing-things said to me
Until ... calvary
Ah you said, you said new love grows on trees
New love grows on trees
New love grows on... new love grows on trees
Are you still shaking out
All the dead wood from your bed love
Well times don't change and you're still thinking of
All of those pretty rhymes for love divine
Oh no, you really don't have to
If you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Shall I kill you
Oh I know you asked me to
But I really don't want to

She likes to sleep with the radio on
So she can dream of her favorite song
The one that no one has ever sung
Since she was small
She'll never know that she made it up
She had a soul and we ate it up
Thrown away like a paper cup
The music falls
The only flaw in her detailed plan
Is where she wins back the love of her man
Everyone knows that he's never coming back
He took her heart and she took his name
He couldn't stand taking all the blame
He left her only with guilt and shame
And then she cracked
Won't it be dull
When we rid ourselves of all demons haunting us
To keep us company
In the dream I refuse to have
She falls asleep in a lukewarm bath
We're left to deal with the aftermath again
On behalf of humanity
I will fight for your sanity
How profound such profanity can be
Won't it be dull
When we rid ourselves of all demons haunting us
To keep us company
Won't it be odd
To be happy like we always thought we're supposed to feel
But never seem to be
Near where I live there's a viaduct
Where people jump when they're out of luck
Raining down on the cars and trucks below
They put a net there to catch their fall
Like that'll stop anyone at all
What they don't know is when nature calls, you go
They say that Jesus and mental health
Are just for those who can help themselves
What good is that when you're living hell on Earth
From the very fear that makes you want to die
Is just the same as what keeps you alive
It's way more trouble than some suicide is worth
Won't it be dull
When we rid ourselves of all demons haunting us
To keep us company
Won't it be odd
To be happy like we always thought we're supposed to feel
But never seem to be
Hard to admit I fought the war on drugs
My hands were tied and the phone was bugged
Another died and the world just shrugged it off

A crowded room on Beverley
A party for the rent
You were sittin' casually
With a few of your fabulous friends
I asked you what your name was
But you just turned and laughed
Then a little later
I finally caught your eye
Even though you tried so hard
You couldn't hide your smile
I followed you downstairs
And we talked for a long, long, long time
Would you call that love
Who's to say?
I don't know much about love
But you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
It wasn't long before you changed
Your phone number to mine
You said that you were movin' in
But you needed a little time
So I kept all your messages
Till you made up your mind
Now the rain is fallin' and the clouds are gatherin'
And the sun refuse to shine
Your promises and whispered words
Are forever on my mind
And I'm left here smokin' cigarettes
That you left behind
Would you call that love
Who's to say?
I don't know much about love
But you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had

Frozen out of focus, the Sunday crowd
Started dreaming of television turned up too loud.
Coded conversation, half baked and tired,
Left us sleeping on blacktops burning the motor mile.
And underneath the arcade, details collide
There's good shopping, but all those patrons have too much style.
And moving in slow motion the boulevard started seeping
With them half-ravers and techno bars.
It is like below the neon sign
All speeding past the line and thrashing, I'm in paradise.
Sealed in concentration, the lantern lights
Started shrinking on dead men drinking white liquor wine.
And I asked the complication, the methane gas
Started leaking on bastards burning half red and black.
We can't ride along in perfect time
All speeding past the line and thrashing, I'm in paradise.
And standing at the gates of NC state fair,
Saw you smoking with all those new friends you've got to spare.
And melting back in focus the Sunday crowd
Started sleeping with white trash heroes, TV's turned down.
In their eyes, below the neon sky
All speeding past the line and thrashing, I'm in paradise.
We can't ride along in perfect time
All dreaming of the white trash heroes on the boulevard. it is like below the neon sky
All speeding past the line and thrashing on the boulevard.
We can't ride along in perfect time
All dreaming of the white trash heroes, I'm in paradise.

It's taken me forever
But I don't want to go
I don't need a reason
I've been working like a dog
Aaah, strung out on time
Aaah, strung out on time
I need a bomb
Exploding in my veins
And if you lost the power
You need to rock & roll the dice
It's losers happy hour
I used to figure out what's in your narrow mind
But, baby, I think it's working overtime tonight
Aaah, strung out on time
Aaah, strung out on time
So where did you run
Where did you run
Lost all the fun
You can't spotlight the sun
Well, I used to figure out what's in your narrow mind
But, honey, I think it's working overtime tonight
Aaah, strung out on time
Aaah, strung out on time
Aaah, strung out on time
Aaah, strung out on time

Every time that I sell myself to you
I feel a little bit cheaper than I need to
I will tear the petals off of you
Rose red I will make you tell the truth
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
Yea she was asking you for it
Did she ask you twice?
Every time that I stare into the sun
Angel dust and my dress just comes undone
Every time that I stare into the sun
Be a model or just look like one
Wild eye rot gut do me in
Do you think you can make me do it again?
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
Yea she was asking you for it
Did she ask you twice?
If you live through this with me
I swear that I will die for you
And if you live through this with me
I swear that I will die for you
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
Yea she was asking you for it
Did she ask you twice?
Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
Yea she was asking for it
Did she ask you twice?

constant suffering surrounds us all as we dance in our arrogance
cautiously we speak, like pulling teeth as we swallow our tongues
so cry out with a rose in hand
tear it in two, it hung over you
not to rest on graves or a lover's vase
but to keep us silent
we won't be silent
blinding and deceiving
what they tell us is the half-truth
in the autumn of our lives we decay
In the autumn of our lives we won't wither in denial
so misleading when the answer is right behind you
throw the rose away and bloom

She walked in, I tipped my hat
She said, "Boy don't you look at me like that"
And I said, "No, you know I got no game"
"Oh, but you can love me just the same"
She said "Boy, my mama told me all about boys like you"
"You talk so sweet then you leave me blue"
"Is that what you think you're about to do"
I said, "No, I'm just sittin' here singing a song"
"Don't want to do nobody wrong"
"You'll find out before long"
Tonight's just all about having fun
Maybe I'll see you when it's done
We'll talk about things that are making you blue
'Til there's one thing left to do
She sat down right in front of the stage
And everybody was so amazed
Put a cigarette right between her lips
Before she could light it, the sax man shot right from the hip
She said, "No, my mama told me all about boys like him"
"Walking around with that sly grin"
"All he wants is a night of sin"
Tonight's just all about having fun
Maybe I'll see you when it's done
We'll talk about what's been making you blue
'Til there's one thing left to do
And I just need some conversation
And I won't tell too many lies
I know it's a sticky situation
But I think I saw that twinkle in your eyes
Tonight's just all about having fun
Maybe I'll see you when it's done
We'll talk about what's making you blue
'Til there's one thing left to do
Well we played till the police closed us down
Drank our drinks till the morning came around
She said, "Boy, everything you told me was true"
"I forgot about my blues, what are you going to do"
I said, "My mama told me all about girls like you"
"Talk a big game and then you leave me blue"
"Is that what you think you're about to do"
She said, "No, I never met a man that's quite like you"
"I think I'm gonna let my mama do the worrying too"
"What you gonna do"
You know tonight was so much fun
And I hate to see it's done
I forgot all my blues
Now there's one thing left to do

He's sending stones skimming and flying
Circles spinning out his time
Though the earth is dying his head is in the stars
Chances are this spark's a lifetime
Out of touch he'll live in wonder
Won't lose sleep he'll just pretend
In his world he won't go under
Turns without him until the end
Rivers run dry but there's no line on his brow
Says he doesn't care who's saved
It's just the dice you roll, the here and now
And he's not guilty or afraid
One day he'll slip away
Cool water flowing all around
In the river and on the ground
Leave a pocketful of stones and not believe in other lives

If ya love somebody, if ya need someone
If ya want somebody, ya, let me be the one
(I wanna) do to you what you do to me
Do to you what you do to me
Let me treat ya right, ya, show I care
'Cause every night, I'll take ya there
Do to you what you do to me
Do to you what you do to me
Don't want just anything, I just want something real
Let down your defenses baby, show me what you feel
Do to you what you do to me
Do to you what you do to me
Should I stay, should I go
There ain't no question, I already know
(I wanna) do to you what you do to me
(help me) do to you what you do to me
Don't want just anything, I just want something real
Let down your defenses baby, show me what you feel

Yeah introducing brutha lets go
Oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ya say you can't be my side chick
But I been blowin' up ya sidekick
Tryna get at you wants a grown man
But you frontin' and ya boy can't it
You say I'm just too much to handle
Cause all the girls wanna ride in the lambo'
But none of the hold a candle to you
So what are you gonna do
[Chorus]
Why we even playin' like this
Why you gotta be on that ish
When we both want this
I can make you love, I can make you love it
Yeah I know you want it
Gonna make you love it yeah yeah yeah
When the truck pull up out front
Be ready don't stop when the horn goin' honk like
Beep beep beep beep beep beep
I be lookin' at you and you be lookin' at me
But you playin' hard to get
You need to holler at me
I got a pocket full of green
In the pocket of my jeans
Hop in oh girl I can give you need
[Chorus]
Just wanna please you
Make you feel like you've never felt
Say I need you
And I don't want no one else
But you

So tell me what I gotta do
[Chorus: x2]

Welcome to the part of the show
Where we fake it 'til we make it
Living in the shadow is cold
Want to burn bright like the sunrise
I close my eyes and dream in technicolor
I'm not the only one
I'm reaching for the glory from the gutter
I'll show them how it's done
C'mon everybody let's go!
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slaying like 1999
C'mon everybody let's go!
Baby we're bright as gold
It don't matter what you've been told
We'll keep slaying it 'til the day we die
C'mon everybody let's-
S - L - A - Y
S - L - A - Y
Once upon a time you believed in tomorrow
In the cosmos
But then you didn't land on your feet
In the jungle, better hustle
Because I close my eyes and dream in technicolor
I'm not the only one
I'm reaching for the glory from the gutter
I'll show them how it's done
C'mon everybody let's go!
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slaying like 1999
C'mon everybody let's go!
Baby we're bright as gold
It don't matter what you've been told
We'll keep slaying it 'til the day we die
C'mon everybody let's-

Tonight you and I
We can shine like razorblades
Line 'em up and go all the way
That's right, you and I
We'll forget our yesterdays
Line 'em up and go all the way
We can do anything
It don't matter what people think
We'll keep slaying like 1999
C'mon everybody let's go!
It don't matter what you've been told
We'll keep slaying it 'til the day we die
C'mon everybody let's-

(hello there ladies and gentelmen)
hello there ladies and gentlemen
wanna join me down your roads
on the interstate where they say it's safe no more
it's gonne come down on you anyway
so pick up the brand new sound
or stick to your guns
and scare me everyday
are we going separate ways
it's gonna hit one day
and i guess that they know nothing at all
under a big attack
living under a big attack
watch you lying and cheating
misleading the weak
and you put on a hell of a show
you spit on the poor
keep them from your doors
let them suffer and fuck them once more
i will travel this world
which is out of control
i can sense it wherever i go
who's gonna sing a lullaby
for the under twenty-one
who's gonna get his share or maybe more
who
it's gonne come down on you anyway
so pick up a brand new sound
i've been trying hard but i just can't get along
are we going separate ways
it's gonna hit one day
and i guess that they know nothing
they know nothing
they know nothing at all
under a big attack
hello there ladies and gentlemen
hello there ladies and gentlemen

All those stories that my dad told me,
They are just a whisper in time
All those things that never came to be,
They are just a whisper in time
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Things that I can't shake from my mind
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Moments that just flicker and die
(memories that flicker and die)
All those places I wanted to go,
They are just a whisper in time
All those friends who now I do not know,
They are just a whisper in time
Maps and roads that brought me here today,
They are just a whisper in time
Circumstances that were explained away,
They are just a whisper in time
We are messengers of memory,
Just whispers in time

Your living room is just a cage
For you to play into their game
They teach you fear - they teach you shame
They make you want - they make you hate
Love is our salvation
It can make you see
Just make your own opinion
Terrorvision - its apathy
Don't want your vision chained to me
Terrorvision - hear my plea
It's my decision to be free
They'll put an image in your wind
They'll make it stay there all the time
They push your buttonis pull your strings
And you won't know its happenin~
Love is our salvation
It can make you see
Just make your own opinion
Terrorvision - its apathy
Don't want your vision chained to me
Terrorvision - hear my plea
It's my decision to be free
They'll make you crazy, bend the truth
They'll suck your soul right out of you
One day you wake up cold as hell
And you won't even know yourself
Terrorvision - its apathy
Don't want your vision chained to me
Terrorvision - hear my plea
It's my decision to be free

Jesus Eternal
Eternally kissing the earth
Painful, sees through the real color of waves
Feeling the world tremble
Eternal, eternal, eternally, eternal, eternal, eternally
Eternal, eternal, eternally, eternal
Deep in the yellow May fall and bright
Scarlet to white hopeful
We, fair and simple, somehow in fight
Slow gleaming highs we resemble
Eternal, eternal, eternally, eternal, eternal, eternally
Eternal, eternal, eternally, eternal, eternal, eternally
Eternal

You can put em on the counter, there with all the other flowers and help me figure out how to turn off this TV.
I'm glad you made the visit, and if you think you have a minute,
You should sit and talk until it's time to leave.
Is my granddaughter, Ruthie, still working at the movies?
Does she still let all her boyfriends in for free?
Does she still stare out the front door, as she's serving popcorn and talk about how nice the day's supposed to be?
Oh, oh, oh,
That's the love that I came to bear witness to.
Oh, oh, oh,
And the love I'm taking with me when I go.
Did you notice walking over, there's a house there at the corner.
There's a dog behind a window that doesn't move.
I've seen him staring in the morning, I've seen him staring in the evenings,
As if time stops til his master's in the room.
Oh, oh, oh,
That's the love that I came to bear witness to.
Oh, oh, oh,
And the love I'm taking with me when I go.
Some nights get worse than others, and I start thinking about your mother;
And she's here with me, as far as I can tell.
As if the work revealed it's secret, and it's asking me to keep it,
Like a kid that hears the ocean in a shell.
That's the love that I came to bear witness to,
And the love I'm taking with me when I go.
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhh...
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhh...
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhhhh...
That's the Love that I came to bear witness to...
Oh, oh, oh,
And the love I'm taking with me when I go; the love I'm taking with me when I go...
Oh, oh, oh...

Ty:
I hugged the wife and drove to work today,
It was only a few miles.
Was in no hurry but the lights were changing up ahead,
So I stepped on the gas.
I checked the Mac,I left it on overnight,
Downloading all the latest files.
Peer-to-peer, the torrent flows into my lap,
And I disconnect.
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, no need to remind us
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, but won't connect the dots
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, locked away inside us
Ty and Arjen:
We are dying for tomorrow, We are living for today
Ty:
I rushed back home to my family,
I got my son a brand new game.
No need to cook, I picked up fast food on the way,
And it's fingerlickin' good.
Have you seen little Steve today?
Guess he's still up there in his room.
But if he comes down, tell him
I'll be right here just staring at the tube
Playing his game.
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, no need to remind us
Ty:
We all know

We all know, but won't connect the dots

Ty and Arjen:
We are dying for tomorrow, We are living for today
Don't you think it's rather warm tonight?
Especially for the time of year.
I turn up the air pull the sheets up to my chin,
And I close my eyes.
Can't relax, can't fall asleep,
Should I take another pill?
I turn on the lights, light up a cigarette and smile,
I've got it made.
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, no need to remind us
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, but won't connect the dots
Ty:
We all know
Arjen:
We all know, locked away inside us
Ty and Arjen:
We are dying for tomorrow, We are living for today

Midnight, my doorbell rings
You're standing in the cold with a few of your things, and you're crying
I know words for talking slow
You don't have to tell me, I don't want to know
When times get tough, you always run right back to me
But I don't care, if it makes you feel better
'Cause you shake me up, break me up - when you're around, I can't get enough
Oh you shake me up, break me up - girl, you tear me apart
Yeah yeah yeah ya shake me up
The next day, the frontdoor slams
You're standing in the street with another man, and you're laughing
You move close, you shake his hand
You smile at me like I understand, oh
In your eyes there is a promise you'll be back
And that's all I need to make me feel better
'Cause you shake me up, break me up - when you're around, I can't get enough
Oh you shake me up, break me up - girl, you tear me apart
Shake me up, break me up - when you're around, I can't get enough
Oh you shake me up, break me up - girl, you tear me apart
Yeah yeah yeah ya shake me up
Why don't you make up your mind? You better stop wastin' my time
At night, my doorbell rings
You're standing in the cold with all of your things, and you're smiling
You walk in and say hello
You don't have to tell me, ''cause I already know
No more tears, you won't be standing in the cold
You'll be back with me, and it'll be better, oh better
'Cause you shake me up, break me up, when you're around, I can't get enough
Come on shake me up, break me up
Shake me up, break me up - when you're around, I can't get enough
Oh you shake me up, break me up - girl, you tear me apart
Shake me up, break me up [Repeat]

A stable place in the scheme was all that you asked for,
You find it hard to concentrate through the laughter
Use the height of competence, to break the common ground
Beyond the bad experience, an answer can be found
Typically a few will stop your momentum
With solid focus broken, why would you let them?
Use the height of competence to break the common ground
Beyond the bad experience, vengence swings around
Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?
See me lashing at will, even after the kill
Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?
Tragically mistake you for a man
Suddenly the satisfaction stands
Tragically they'll catch you if they can
Suddenly mortality's a scam
A sad attempt at esacaping from all disaster
Complications restraining all that comes after
Use the height of competence to break the common ground
Beyond the bad experience an answer to be found
Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?
See me lashing at will, even after the kill
Why put the gun to your head, if you're already dead?
Tragically mistake you for a man
Suddenly the satisfaction stands
Tragically they'll catch you if they can
Suddenly mortality's a scam

just like rats in a concrete maze
they all starve for the wage raise bait
i'm dying to escape
self made men with their plastic cash
big talk plans and kissing ass
just ain't my strategy
uptown is gonna sell me
downtown is gonna kill me
uptown is gonna take me
downtown i'm clenching to my soul
uptown (oh)
alive without control
downtown (oh)
alive without control
uptown (oh)
alive without control
puppet shows from 9-5
they dress up slaves in a suit and tie
they're living to die
follow the leader not your heart
simon says boy you'll go far
like lemmings in the dark
uptown is gonna sell me
downtown is gonna kill me
uptown is gonna take me
downtown i'm clenching to my soul
uptown (oh)
alive without control
downtown (oh)
alive without control
uptown (oh)
alive without control
i said uptown is gonna sell me
downtown is gonna kill me
uptown is gonna take me
(oh no) i'm clenching to my soul
uptown
uptown (oh)
alive without control
downtown (oh)
alive without control
uptown (oh)
alive without control
uptown
alive without control
downtown
alive without control
uptown
alive without control

To change the world,
It starts with one step
However small,
First step is hardest of all
Once you get to your gate
You will walk in tall
You said you never did,
Cause you might die trying
Cause you might die trying
Cause you
If you close your eyes
Cause the house is on fire
And think you couldn't move
Until the fire dies
The things you never did
Cause you might die trying
Cause you might die trying
We'll be as good as dead
Cause you might die trying
Cause you might die trying
If you give you begin to live
If you give you begin to live
You begin
You get the world
If you give, you begin to live
You get the world, you get the world
If you give, you being to live
But you might die trying
Oh, you might die trying
You might die trying
The things you never did
Cause you might die trying
You'll be as good as dead
You never did?

[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]
With a gun inside your mouth life's rushing by
In the shade of sin; to live you have to die
Convicting yourself to the cross; it was your loss
The face made of tragic and tears:
Now it's here
It goes on and on and on
From the cradle to the grave
Well, it rolls like a wheel
The torture goes on and on
In the houses made of stone you try to hide
But the eyes of the beholder will try
To drag you from heaven to hell, I tell
The treasure, the struggle in pain
All in vain
It goes on and on and on
From the cradle to the grave
Well, it rolls like a wheel
On and on and on
On and on and on
It goes on and on and on
On and on and on
It goes on and on and on
[Solo: Nordlund / Haglund]
Now you're gone
The torments tongue brought you under the ground
I can see it now so clear; you have to die
Convicting yourself to the cross; it was your loss
The face made of tragic and tears
Now it's near
It goes on and on and on
From the cradle to the grave
Well, it rolls like a wheel
The torture goes on and on
It goes on and on and on
From the cradle to the grave
In the calm in the storm
On and on and on
On and on
From the cradle to the grave
On and on and on and on

Yeah, gunna sing a song about the blues,
And man and his hallucinations.
Oh the rust stains in my pathway,
And the gravestones of my here say say.
I been crammed up my byway,
As the milestones of every every day,
But the truth is here to find,
And I'm gunna make it mine,
And I'll find it my way.
(Chorus)
Oh jealousy reeks with pain and time,
But why are so many good eyes blind?
Will they ever stop a fightin' long enough to find,
Their way to happiness and peace of mind?
Or will they end up eatin' the flesh of their own kind?
Oh, I don't wear no uniform,
Yeah, and I don't carry a gun.
But I can tell you many many wars,
That I have lost and won.
Yeah, and my friends might as me,
What color are these blues?
And then I might say,
Black is their color, black as any ordinary day.
(Repeat Chorus)

I'm going back to the land of the blind
Back to the land where the sun never shines
I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find
Everything just as it was before I left it all behind
I slept at nights there hysterically
Twisted and turned but I just couldn't get free
I opened my eyes, I still couldn't see
But I could feel her, China white girl
So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey, oh
Ooh, that was a Japanese dream alright
The sound of the storm and the flickering light
And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like
Like her scent used to fill up the night
So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey
Just look at me now, just look at me this way
It looks like I am quite insane
It looks like I am trying to eat off my face
Looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway
Back where the sun never shines
Back to the land of the blind
Back in a Japanese dream
In a Japanese dream

I should'a known better not to wait around
Take it back home (Cause I hate her)
I should'a known better not to wait around
I'm getting rid of my phone (So I make it clear
Never did never did I ever love anyone other then you
But secretly I always want to see you cry so I push you until you do
Check it out
I should'a never came I should'a never should'a never came to you
You insisted for me to
Cause I lied and didn't mean to, I take it back,
If I thought It'd make it work, but it didn't but it meant to
I, I, I give up...
[Chorus]
I never did what you said I did
When I was gone for so long
I never sided with what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong
You dreamt of him
If you trust me, just trust me baby find the words and find these feelings
Roll your eyes when you look at me, hard to talk when you look at the ceiling
Your still pushed up baby with everything you been through lately
I'll be there when close your eyes hold you tight say goodnight
[Chorus]
I, I needed, all I, I needed was someone to talk to
And you, you needed you you needed me to hold you
I, I needed, all I, I needed was someone to talk to
And you, you needed you you needed me to hold you
[Chorus]

Sciuri Sciura
Sciuri Sciura
Doolie on their way
Sciuri Sciura
Sciuri Sciura
Doolie on their way
I am alright
You are hoax
We are oxymoron
You are on fever
Supersticion
Please don't tell you more
Sciuri Sciura
Sciuri Sciura
Doolie on their way
Sciuri Sciura
Sciuri Sciura
Doolie on their way

You point your finger at me
I'm a mirror to you
And you don't like what you see
And they think I'm insane
'Cause I got my own brain
Ya know, I really don't care
They, they don't wanna know me
Makes it harder to judge
Makes it harder to stink
And it's always the same
And I'm always to blame
And they gather outside
With their torches held high
Now the freak must die
But the freak is not I.
This is our last chance to break free
One last chance before they break me
This is our last chance to break free
One last chance before they break me down
Beware - beware of the Have-Nots
You're just an image to them
Of what they want but don't got
They'll call you every bad name
Breaking you is a game
'Til you're one and the same
(It's a fucking shame.)
And you - you objectify
A body for you to burn
But that body aint mine
And it's always the same
And I'm always to blame
And they gather outside
With their torches held high
Now the freak must die
But the freak is not I.
This is our last chance to break free
One last chance before they break me
This is our last chance to break free
One last chance before they break me down

Feel the pain teaching us
How much more we can take
Reminding us
How far we've come
Let the pain burn away
From our hearts
We have time to start
All over again
Feel the pain teaching us
How much more we can take
Reminding us
How far we've come
Let the pain burn away
From our hearts
We have time to start
All over again
Feel the pain teaching us
How much more we can take
Reminding us
How far we've come
Let the pain burn away
From our heart
We have time to start
All over again
Well, if you would shine
Your love down here, oh
Make our hearts
As perfect as new
Oh, if you would shine
Your love down here, oh
I promise I'll reflect it
Right back at you
Oh, I promise I'll reflect it
Right back at you
Oh, I promise we'll reflect it
Right back at you

Sunday, Sunday, here again in tidy attire
You read the color supplement, the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate
Regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep
Oh, the Sunday sleep
Sunday, Sunday here again, a walk in the park
You meet an old soldier and talk of the past
He fought for us in two world wars
And says the England he knew is no more
He sings the Songs of Praise every week but always falls asleep
For the Sunday sleep
Sunday
Sunday
Oh Sunday sleep
Sunday, Sunday, here again in tidy attire
You read the color supplement, the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate
Regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep

I have these two arms,
Two arms to hold you tight,
And a heart that longs for you,
Each day and every night,
I can only give a love that's true,
For this is all I've got to give to you,
I can't give you a castle of gold,
Or diamond rings that shine,
I can only give myself,
Until the end of time,
I can you give pretty skies of blue,
For this is all I've got to give to you,
Someday we'll have magic sunsets,
Together we'll have each night,
I promise you this my darling,
Everything's gonna be alright,
Darling, I must go away,
Far across the sea,
But you hold the lock to my heart,
And I'll give you the key,
I can't give you anymore, it's true,
For this is all I've got to give to you

You can call me dangerous, superstitious, passe', what you wish
You can take my freedom, education, pride, love & honor
'cause I'm through with the war you're fightin'
Body and soul dividin'
Arrogance of enlightenment
With no fear of God almighty
Idle minds wait for signs out of line
You can keep your solutions, propaganda, justice, paranoia
Desire unable to satisfy you
Happiness will deny
With no fear of God almighty

Rita Mae, Rita Mae, come an' visit me today
Rita Mae, Rita Mae, come an' visit me today
I'll do anything you want, give you anything you say
I saw you out walking with your other man today
I said I saw you out walking with your other man today
If I catch you one more time, I'm a blow you both away
Rita Mae, Rita Mae, I'll see you one more time today
Rita Mae, Rita Mae, I'll see you one more time today
When I've finished what I've done gonna come and drive you away

Only when I dream but there's no way out
You learn to talk, you learn to shout
Focus on depth that was never there
Eliminate what you can't repair
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passing, flash right through me
See through the wind to awakened stream
Adjust your eyes to the state of things
Focus on depths that was never there
Nothing's easy nothing's fair
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passing, flash right through me

Nothing's better than the day
The day you told me: yeah it's true
You're everything I mean to you
And nothing's sadder than away
The days that I'm away from you
And there is nothing I can do
When I want to be with you
All day
We're gonna see tomorrow fade away
Just to have you here with me
I promise I will never leave
I want you always constantly
Well I'm still breathing in that day
Coming up the night before
I'm cutting pieces on the floor
Well, nothing sad won't go away
I had you as we watched them fall
Lying face down after all
We're dying on the floor
All day
We're gonna see tomorrow fade away
Just to have you here with me
I promise I will never leave
I want you always constantly
I want you always constantly
Always away
I don't want I don't need to save you
I don't want - want to save you
All I need to know is what you want (x4)
All day
We're gonna see tomorrow fade away
Just to have you here with me
I promise I will never leave
I want you always constantly
I want you always constantly

The day turns into night
The dog will always bite
The serpent's underground
He lies without a sound
So let the serpent sleep
Oh let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep
The worm will eat the peach
There's pebbles on the beach
The swine is in the mud
The eagle flies above
So let the serpent sleep
Oh let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep
The ocean lives and breathes
And man creates machines
Children run away
And night turns into day
So let the serpent sleep
Let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep
Let the serpent sleep
Let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep

You don't know what it feels like
Runnin' down my nowhere road
and you, you don't know what I'd give for you
Cause the choice not to tell you I chose
But this is where I live
In the deep grove of all this nothingness
We're not as different as you think
I may be smaller,
But I guess I've never been so unsure
I hate the way that I just can't hate you
So I'm stuck here lyin' in my grave
You're breakin' hearts
You're makin' marks upon my skin
And I finally figured out
that I just can't win
But this is where I live
In the deep grove of all this nothingness
We're not as different as you think
I may be smaller,
But I guess I've never been so unsure
I hate to hide my face
I just can't live this way
I just can't face that I know
I've gotta learn to dream
Cause now I know I see that
But this is where I live
In the deep grove of all this nothingness
We're still not as different as you think
I may be smaller,
But I guess I've never been so unsure
But it's okay,
I never hoped to win anything more

Given to crescent moon
Chaldean echoes of spectral gloom
Like a pen pal of the gods
No horns no reply
Flowers of sorcery
Like pearls before the swine
Defying space and time
Sez the pineal gland of mine
Like,
Given to dreaming witches' lie
It's sweet to close your weary eyes
Given to pentacles and more
Drunk with the blood of the whore
Gimme some Metatron
Damn my immortal soul
But show me something that I don't know
Gimme some Metatron
Given to waning moon
Septuagint whispers of impending doom
Cautes and Cautopates
A shit load of bad ass deities
Wore out my shovel
Burying monsters where they popped up
And it's OK
Doesn't matter anyway
For Babalon above
For Babalon below
Gimme some Metatron

Sunday in Memphis it's hallelujah dawn
I can hear the angels singin
Such a beautiful song
Lost here in Memphis
Feeling so alone
I can hear the church bells ringing
Callin me back home
Down on my luck
Here on these sidewalks
It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sunday in Memphis
And I'm wishing you were here
I can still remember
Every word she said
With every step that's taken
And every tear that's shed
Fell down on my knees
Said please forgive me lord won't you please
It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sunday in Memphis
And I'm wishing you were here
We all make mistakes sometimes
That's just the way it goes
But we can change and make it right I know
It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sunday in Memphis
And I'm wishing you were here

Tell me, why you wanna drive my gasket down?
Tell me darling, why you drive my gasket down?
All them unwanted children never be forgiven now
Hear them drivin' miles out of town
Hear them drivin' miles out of town
All them engines, all them holes, all in the ground
Sister grindin', all around your daddy's knee
Sister grindin', all around your daddy's knee
Sister grindin', all around your daddy's knee
I don't need no gasket, just to grind
Just grind all over me

Without a doubt, I've taken all you can give
And now I suffer through this song
Feel free to hum along
Going back a few short years, I can see
That I was never really here
As I collect the facts and sort them in rows
It seems the question's always been
"How long can I keep this going?"
You can use it against me
In your saddest state of mind
Use it against me with my ego on the line
Use it against me anytime
I try to simplify the plot to an outline
But I can never make the end
I want to read some lines
That stray from the screenplay
Improvisation's never been
Something I can keep going
You can use it against me
In your saddest state of mind
Use it against me with my ego on the line
Use it against me
I've never preached a single word
That doesn't sound absurd
I don't know how to pound it in
To make it stick under my skin
You can use it against me
In your saddest state of mind
Use it against me with my ego on the line
Use it against me anytime

Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman

Oh-huh
Just like a woman
Just be my little woman
Love me like a woman, yeah

I can take one heart that's been misused
Take two eyes been cryin' the blues
Kiss your lips and then count to three
Make you forget every man but me
I'm the fixer
Make the stubborn mule wanna run

And the fixer gets it done

The fixer

Tell me something away from trouble
And away from doubting
Tell me straight from the spirit
From the top of the mountain
Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning, as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you
It's a simple thing we've got to do
Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Do the best I can
Tell me something before I stumble
And show my weakness
Tell me right on the limewire
Fighting for progress
I can hear there's a sound that's coming through
There's a post in the ground so what we gonna do?
You can have all your dreams if you really believe
In something that's something true
Just a listening man
Trying to understand
Just a listening man
Do the best I can
Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Get carried through this land
Tell me something without any lies
That cover my feelings
Give me time now I understand
These lessons have meaning
Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning, as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you
It's a simple things we've got to do
Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Do the best I can
Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Get carried through this land
Just a listening man
Do the best I can
Just a listening man
I'm a listening man
I'm a listening man
I'm a listening man
I'm a listening man

THE BOY:
I was cast adrift, without a hope
My only friend is my old boat
With an empty sea and an open sky
A void no man can justify.
THE OLD MAN:
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more.
Lost and drowned
We'll wait 'till England's found
Again.
THE BOY:
I was torn between what was good and right
And those who told me when to fight
So they left me here and they sailed away
To sink or swim 'til Judgement Day.
THE OLD MAN:
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more.
Lost and drowned
We'll wait 'till England's found
Again.
THE BOY:
I was cast adrift.

You're making me doubt myself
This feeling I know so well
Visions of naked greed
Are visions I just don't need
Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Far from living, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
The texture of moistened skin
All over this skin I've been
Skin that's been angel stretched
No muscle or excess flesh
Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Far from living, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
You're making me doubt myself
This feeling I know so well
Feeling of naked lust
This feeling I love so much
Far deep, phantom seeking, oh you are
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Phantom breathing, oh you are
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Upon the wall, the life is drawn
The love is lost, the truth will fall
The sinking ship, the sinking soul
The final fear, the picture on the wall

Don't like your stare
Don't like the arm in the air
Your style is so brash
And that silly moustache
It was, table talk
The evil I see
Sends bad vibrations through me
And oh what a square
With your diagonal hair
It was, table talk
L said to Gilly
'how do you do table talk?'
'how do you do table talk?'
And this is what she said;
'love love love love
The love of his life
Too close to become a wife
And the death of this girl
Came close to saving the world
From his table talk

Intempted, to what this wrong
Condition, I thought was gone
It isn't easy to walk through rings of fire
Long shadows, put out the light
Solutions, have lost their sight
And I erase it
When it's gone, any tragedy won't matter
Heavy flood, running from the empty room
And one depends on two
One intempted
In fables, somewhere to hide
This prison, leaves me inside, a constant aching
Tired believer, time to let it go
Tried to save it, the best I know,
Count the reasons
Jadded are the losses, suffer me now
Your bloated will cries, swelling down in agony
Gone, any tragedy won't matter
When it's gone, my surrender to the pain
Heavy flood, running from the empty room
And when one depends on two
One intempted

Warm ocean
My feet in the sand
Swirling motion
Round salty water
Tonight I'll save you
[Chorus:]
Shells and butterflies
...
Feel the ocean
Intoxicating photograph
of emotion
A filtered moment
Feel the wide ocean
My voice in the water
...
...
...

when its gone...
life is meaningless, until its gone
but who gives a fuck when its gone?
when its gone...
you cannot see the end, until its gone
there is no more light in your eyes
lonely conviction
lonely goodbye
and your eyes look so helpless in the night, by the pale moonlight
and i will be there, holding you tight
as the blood flows like rain all through the night, in the pale moonlight
when its gone...
losing everything
all fucking gone
i need to hear your screams
you stole my everything
always the last to know
its your turn to feel it now

If you're scared to die
You better not be scared to live
I've been spending all my days
Giving all I can give
Last night I heard someone walk in
Through my bedroom door
What they wanted I'm not exactly sure
A friendly ghost is all I need
Marking time on a broken watch
Counting days 'til the old pawn shop
Sells me back my saxophone
Then everyone's gonna leave me alone
Two times I thought I heard someone
Knocking on the glass
I hid my head and prayed that it would pass
A friendly ghost is all I need
If you're scared to die
You better not be scared to live
I've been carrying 'round a grudge
Think I better forgive
Last night I heard footsteps walking
On the attic floor
I got up and I opened up the door
A friendly ghost is all I need

I'm trying to find a moment with You
These days are speeding by
This ring gives me a new point of view
I'm a dealer of my time
And if I can make a confession
My time is torn between
The man who has won my affections
And the God who made me
And oh, it all looks different
But that doesn't mean anything has changed
'Cause still I, I reach for You
When I, I am afraid
And this breath that comes from You
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name, yeah, yeah
I look at the life of Anna
Your presence was her home
I look at the life of my mother
Praying on her back porch
Oh, it all looks different
But that doesn't mean anything has changed
'Cause still I, I reach for You
When I, I am afraid
And this breath that comes from You
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name, yeah
One day very soon, face to face
I'll give an account of my time to You, to You
So I will reach for You
When I am afraid
'Cause this breath that comes from You
Helps me say, yeah
Helps me say, yeah
'Cause still I, I reach for You
When I, I am afraid
And this breath that comes from You
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name
Helps me say Your name, yeah, yeah
I'm trying to find a moment with You
These days are speeding by

I'll see you in the castle,
Corner of Wigmore Street.
We'll take a drink, and maybe think,
Seek a sordid place where we can meet.
More forgotten people, rain still teeming down.
That's all there is to do,
In this desperate and dismal town.
But I still I keep on comin',
I daisy-chain my life away.
Gotta keep on doing nothing,
Till the call on Judgement Day.
Got no religion, just living hell.
If I had money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well.
Stand in the doorway, wait for a man to come.
Got no religion, and my life's just begun.
Waiting for next Sarurday night,
When it all kicks off.
I got a date with miss Ludo, Ludovica Nabokov.
Nothing happened last weekend,
I guess it never will.
It stays the same if I don't change,
There is no panacea pill.
But I still I keep on comin',
I daisy-chain my life away.
I try to keep on doing nothing,
Till the call on Judgement Day.
Got no religion, just living hell.
If I had some money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well.
Stand in the doorway, wait for a man to come.
Got no religion, and my life's just begun.
Got no religion.
I try to change most everything,
I even change my name.
I change my clothes, and I change my friends.
But I end up still the same.
"Change must come from within"
That's what the man has said...
"Willingness is all you need, son
You're old, but you're not dead"
And still it keeps on comin',
I daisy-chain my life away.
I try to keep on doing nothing,
Till the call for Judgement Day.
Got no religion, nowhere to run
Got nothing going, and I still can't feel the sun.
Wait for a new day, a Messianic dawn,
Same terraced houses, with their cold curtains drawn.
Got no religion, just living hell.
If I had some money, I'd drop it all in the wishing well.
Stand in the doorway, wait for the man to come.
Got no religion, and my life's just begun.
Yeah my life's just begun!

We used to drive all night and listen to the radio
We'd push the front seats up and make the back our bedroom
Just stay here all night long, be strong
Forget the world we're living in
Mother, I know you know I'm having a good time
I'm sleeping so little but I'm living a good life
No need to worry, got a place to lay my head down
No need to worry, got a place to sleep
I need somebody to rely on
And you weren't that for me
And you'll never be that for me
Yeah, you'll never be that for me
Yeah, you'll never be
I count down the steps to your apartment
'Cause I'm eager to know if you're even at home
And I called you on the drive home
But you weren't alone
Mother, I know you know I'm having a good time
I'm sleeping so little but I'm living a good life
No need to worry, got a place to lay my head down
No need to worry, got a place to sleep
I need somebody to rely on
And you weren't that for me
And you'll never be that for me
I need somebody to rely on
And you weren't that for me
And you'll never be that for me
I love you but I'm not sure that I really want to touch you
But I will only if you ask me to
Yeah, you'll never be that for me
Yeah, you'll never be that for me
I need somebody to rely on
And you weren't that for me
And you'll never be that for me
I need somebody to rely on
And you weren't that for me
And you'll never be that for me
Yeah, you'll never be that for me

This song for you
Hello darling, this is the army,
I've just got the time to write,
Today we attack, there's no turning back,
The boys they're all ready for the fight.
Yes, I'm well but this place is like hell,
They call it Passchendaele,
In nineteen seventeen the war must be ending,
The general said this attack will not fail;
So I'm writing down this simple little melody
When you play it my love, think for me...
We'll be together in this song for you,
And it goes la la la, sing it darling, la la la
They got old bill and the sergeant is still out there
Wounded in some shell hole,
They say this war will end all wars,
Oh God I really hope it will,
Oh how's old England, are they still singing
Those songs that we loved to sing,
When all this is over, we'll go sailing in Dover,
Catching fish like we used to with a string,
Oh I miss you, I miss you, I miss you,
If they get me my love you will know
We'll always be together in this song for you
And it goes la la la, I have to go now
Take care of yourself my love.

Maybe it's too easily fit
No problem seems to be as hard as before
Look for me under pillows
Hiding from self created anger
Sucking the dust for what's left
Well what do you care anyway
I'm like a spare tire, who is used when the first one breaks
Sorry if I'm out of style
I never meant to be in your way
Tell me when I've gone too far
I slipped and I grabbed the first thing I could find
You would've done the same
I've been away for too long this time
And you know probably I'm to blame for almost everything

It's to reveal that fucked up cop
Amped up on prescription pills
That brought my heart to a stop
And I want to tell you there's a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
I met a girl on the square
Who showed me how to kill my cares
But once that's done, man, there's nothing to do
Time's running backwards from me and you
There's a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
My body's running but I don't see why it bothers
Sat down in jail with this friend of mine
Who'd never close both his eyes
But one was shut all the time
To cover the thing he was scared of
While he watched with the other
There was a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
There's a riot coming
There's a riot coming
There's a riot coming

Well if this old fiddle could talk
If this old fiddle could sing
Man if this old fiddle could only talk
It could tell you some wondrous things
Talk to me fiddle
Tell me about when you came across the sea
In the hands of a jewish immigrant who was longing to be free
And you were part of his life for forty years
Through times both lean and fat
And he raised his family and lived out his days
In a New York tenement flat
Talk to me fiddle
Tell me about how that cajun fiddlin' man
Found you in a pawn shop and took you back down
To the Louisiana bayou land
You knew his wife and you knew his kids
And you watched his family grow
And you played your heart out caju'n style
At the Louisiana Fais Do Do
Well talk to me fiddle
Then a big shot yankee gambler found you down in New Orleans
And took you up the river on the Mississippi Queen
Then there came the day that you were all
That he had left to lose
And a black man won you in a poker game
And taught you how to play the blues
Talk to me fiddle
Then a hobo from Biloxi found you living in the rain
And he got himself a free ride on a west-bound cattle train
And you got off in Texas
Where they play that western swing
Where the people do the two-step
And old Bob Wills was the king
Talk to me fiddle
You've been bouncing around America from sea to shining sea
Now your traveling days are over fiddle 'cause you belong to me

Once when I was a girl
I could have given you a ride for your money
Oh, but how times have changed
Although you do look cute in those red cowboy boots
No, you don't mess around
But you're just a kid, you don't know what it takes
No one can stop you now
Anymore than they can tell the wind not to blow
Who's going to run you now?
With the riders in the dirt back on astelin turf
I can't tell you what to do
You're free as a bird, go do what you've got to do
Don't you worry boy
Life will come and find you
You're going to blow their minds
Show them all a thing or two
Don't you worry boy
Life will come and find you
You're going to blow their minds
Show them all a thing or two
All the good in this life, wish for yourself
All the good in this life, wish for yourself
All the good in this life, wish for yourself
All the good in this life, wish for yourself

I couldn't wait to see you, waiting by the door
There's no one there to meet me, and your clothes are on the floor
Sorry if I hurt you, and I made you cry
Couldn't stand to see you, with another guy
It's the bluest blues, and it cuts me like a knife
It's the bluest blues, since you walked out of my life
Couldn't really tell you, how you hurt my pride
Something broke within me, down inside
I never knew I loved you, til you went away
Now the loneliness surrounds me, everyday
It's the bluest blues, since you walked out of the door
It's the bluest blues, 'cause I won't see you no more
I'm sorry if I failed you, if somehow I'm to blame
It's the bluest blues I'm feeling, it's a cryin' shame
I just can't live without you, face another day
It's the bluest blues I'm feeling, and it's here to stay
It's the bluest blues, and it cuts me to the bone
It's the bluest blues, when you can't find your way home

Winter's breath feels so cold
Calling chaos from control
Depths of madness to unfold
As my inner demons feed
A battery that's charged inside
Powering my redrum ride
Dr. Jeckyll quickly turns to Hyde
Now there's no blood left to bleed
Born of anger
Blinded by the rage that burns in me
Born of anger
Driving me insane I can't break free
Stare into my lifeless eyes
Feel the flames of hatred rise
Fueled by my accuser's lies
I'm a man without redemption
On broken glass I walk alone
A bed of nails I call my home
Veins of ice and heart of stone
A tribute to aggression
Don't waste your time to understand me
Psychoanalyze and pry just so you can brand me
I am the child of hope that has died
Twisting and turning with venom inside
From this world I am freed only then you will see
The monster you have made...
Of me
Solitude becomes my song
Silence slowly screams along
The choir's chorus heard so strong
The symphony begins
An impulse sent straight to my brain
One false move against my grain
Violence erupts again
The madness always wins

"The Big Bang has created one soul, the Universal Migrator. The Universal Migrator
divides itself, and each Migrator flies off independently in search of a habitable planet
in order to breathe life into it. I follow the migrator that will eventually reach our
planet Earth."
[Russel Allen, Damian Wilson]
At the birth of time, the beginning of beginnings
One cosmic soul was created
A bringer of life, a universal migrator
Born to sow its seeds in all the galaxies
Like a cell dividing, it spreads in all directions
Creating life among the stars
I'm struck with awe as I join the great migrator
Now it takes flight to the brightest star of all
On a quest for life, through the sable skies
What a show! behold!
The dawn of a million souls
On a bold crusade, in the realm of shade
What a show! behold!
The dawn of a million souls
Through the glowing mist, like a fog of radiation
I can see the forming of new planets
I've been struck by thunder as I witness all the splendor
And I realize how small we really are
Ooh, I can see forever
On the wings of dreams I fly
Is this real or is it just a fantasy?
What awaits me now at the end of this ride?

Gather up the pots and the old tin can
And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran
And then run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney
Now keep your eyes well peeled today
The tall, tall men, they're on their way
They're searching for the mountain tea
In the hills of Connemara
Gather up the pots and the old tin can
And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran
And then run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney
A gallon for the butcher and a quart for Tom
And a bottle for the poor old Father Tom
To help the poor old dear along
In the hills of Connemara
Gather up the pots and the old tin can
And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran
And then run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney
Now swing to the left, now swing to the right
Sure, the excise man can dance all night
He's drinkin 'up the tea 'til the broad daylight
In the hills of Connemara
Gather up the pots and the old tin can
And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran
And then run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney
Now, stand your ground, and don't you fall
The excise men, they're at the wall
Jesus Christ, they're drinkin' it all
In the hills of Connemara
Gather up the pots and the old tin can
And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran
And then run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney
(2x)

Then as it was, then again it will be
An' though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be
Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad
Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good
'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would
Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darlin', oh darlin'
I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave
Holdin' on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone

It's time to get away
It's time to get away from this world...
Please tell me why do you lie girl,
The guy is dead but you're still alive...
Please tell me why do you lie,
Just face the truth what you're hiding from
The world around you keeps going round and you will never stop it
Please tell me why do you lie,
You still feel the pain as time goes by
Please tell me why do you lie,
Won't you just give us another chance?
The world around you keeps going round and you will never stop it
When you lie, life goes on and you will never stop it

Sunrise
Get up in the mornin'
You know, I dig this mornin'
The sun is shinin' bright
I'm gonna get outside
Gonna wash my face
Grab my hat
Put it on my head
I take a walk downtown
Yeah... because I feel so-oh good
I think I'm gonna take a walk downtown
Hey! sunrise!
Wo!
Somethin' I never seen before
Been walkin' down the street every day
Nobody like you ever passed my way
Maybe it must be too much sun
Couldn't be my hat, must be too much...
Wait a minute! is that you?
What's that? ...what, what's that? ...

You know I wasn't born yesterday!
Heh heh heh!

(jeff simmons tries to corrupt napoleon murphy brock by showing him a lewd dance and suggesting that he'd smoke a high-school diploma...)
Hey! wait a minute!

This stuff is expensive

And you're drivin' me to smoke it? !...
Just before, we smoked the tapes that you made.
Smoked the tapes?
Smoked the tapes of your group.

You can really get off.

A joint.

No man!
Where you been in livin'? ...reseda?
No, san jose.
(the evil dope pusher is cutting up a white gym sock, formerly owned by carl zappa and still damp. the shredded sock will be placed inside of a high-school diploma and ignited with a sulphur-pre

Ee stuffed with absolutely nothing at all. smoke that and it'll really get you out there!...)
I still don't feel as good as I felt this mornin'...yeah yeah...
(you'll grow out of it...)
Dummy up!
I heard it again, somebody said...
You see this?
Wait a minute!...
College!
College!
That's college-rhythm.
You mean if I smoke that, it's the same as this,
As if I was at college?
Roll it on up!
Roll it on up!
Roll it on up!
Give me that!...
No no, the college degree is stuffed with absolutely nothing at all.
You get, you get nothing with your college-degree...
But that's what I want!
I forgot, I'm sorry...
Well, if you get nothin', well that's what I want.
(a true zen saying: nothing is what I want. the results of a higher education...)

The burning sun hangs over the city
You and me baby, we don't feel nothing at all
From nine to five we're lost
This life ain't so pretty
But when the sun goes down
We know that we can stand tall
I just can't wait
For the night to come
'Cause when the shadows cover the light
We're the only ones
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
Yes, baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
Dancing' on the street
In the heat of the neon
The quiet in the cool night air
Makes it easy to breathe
The music that we hear in our heats
Gives us something to dream of
'Cause when that lonely soul that calls
It's those dreams that we'll need
To keep us strong
To take us far
Far away from the pain of the days
'Cause that's a cruel mental start
But baby, we
We belong to the night
Yes baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
Ahh ahh-ahh-ahh
We belong to the night
Yes, yes baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
'Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
We belong to the night
We belong to the night
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The whole town nearly died
When rocks flew from the sky
The stray dogs whined and howled
At dark foreboding clouds
The mayor screamed and fled
The priest hid under his bed
Uprooted trees did spin
To the sound of a merciless wind
Will you love me when I'm old?
I'm still hoping I can get that far
No one escaped the whirlwind's hold
Except the jailer and his pack of cards
And I sit outside watching falling stars
Playing D minor chords on a Spanish guitar
Well clothes blew through the streets
And so did cinema seats
Their souls could not be saved
I dug a thousand graves
Will you love me when I'm old?
I'm still hoping I can get that far
No one escaped the whirlwind's hold
Except the jailer and his pack of cards
And I sit outside watching falling stars
Playing D minor chords on a Spanish guitar

Bent double like old beggars in sacks
Knock kneed and cursing or coughing like hags
Men marched on sleeping some without boots
Fatigue drunken deaf still to the hoots
Of breaking gas shells
Dropping softly behind
But limped on bloodshed
All went lame all went blind
Gas gas quick boys fumbling helmets in time
Someone still screaming a man in fire or lime
Under a gray cloud dim dark through green light
In all my dreaming before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
Choking guttering drowning
Put in a wagon he had to keep pace
As his eyes melt to his face
If you could hear blood
Gurgling from ruptured lungs
If you could witness
Vile sores on innocent tongues
You would not tell me
Not with such pride and such zest
The lies of history
Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori
Some desperate glory
Pro patria mori
As witness disturbs the story
Pro patria mori
Stand firm boys breathe the glory

They're kissin' in Cleveland, Kansas City, too
They're wailin' in Wildwood, back at Waterloo
They're smoochin' all over, even in St. Loo
So uh-baby get ready, I'm a-kissin' you
Oh, baby 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So treat me right, a-don't-a make-a me fight
The Battle of New Orleans tonight
They're kissin' on beaches, sea to shining sea
Smoochin' on benches, near the Christmas tree
Lipstick on collars down in Tennessee
So a-baby, come on now, start by kissin' me
Oh, oh 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So press your tasty lips to mine
Sweeter than wine and feels so fine, wa-hoo!!
Mmm, 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So treat me right, a-don't-a make-a me fight
The Battle of New Orleans tonight
They're kissin' in drive-ins, you too, Baltimore
Rockin' at dances, land and sea and shore
Then it's off to Dee-troit, they all know the score
So, a-baby, oh baby, what are we waitin' for?
Oh, 'cause summertime is kissin' time USA
So press your tasty lips to mine
Sweeter than wine

You were a good man
Jamsie
Everyone loves you
Now you're gone
And the seagulls over
Where you lie
Sing your final song
I`m walking back
Away from here
To see where you belong
Here's the church
And here's the work
And here's where shows were at the fair
Take me on your skirling waltzer
And scream the ghost train down
And buckle me to the chairy plane
As the big wheel goes round

You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a livin', make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me
Caterpillar in the tree, how you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry hold on tight
I promise you that there will come a day
Butterfly fly away
Turned around and you were there
The two of us made quite a pair
Daddy's little girl was here at last
Looked away and back again
Suddenly a year was ten
Don't know how it got so far so fast
And yes I still don't understand
It's not anything we planned
Kind of makes you think it's meant to be (it's a destiny)
I always knew the day would come
You'd stop crawling, start to run
Beautiful as beautiful can be
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
I hope you find your way and all the things you wish for, love and care about
Butterfly fly away (oh, won't you fly away)
Butterfly fly away (oh, won't you fly away)
Butterfly fly away

Her name was Rita the Whore
La Vida Loca for sure
She knocked 'em out of the park
Streetwalking holes in her shoes
Another sip of the booze
and everything went black
His name was Norman OG
don't you come crying to me
the day that changed his life
He married Rita the Whore
La Vida Loca no more
He said be back in no time
Calls for a cigarette
as good as it can get
and kill some time
It's never comin' back
Forward to Mary and Steve
just turning 20 and free
she really liked his style
Attraction over the moon
they got together and soon
she was expecting a child
Calls for a cigarette
as good as it can get
and kill some time
It's never comin' back
Calls for a cigarette
so don't you wanna bet
and kill some time
She caught an evil disease
it broke her down to her knees
eventually took her life
And when Steve heard the news
took out the doctor she used
and left the scene with a smile
Calls for a cigarette
as good as it can get
and kill some time
It's never comin' back
Calls for a cigarette
so don't you wanna bet
and kill some time

I got my plans from trembling hands
I knew just what to do
Follow each step carefully
And hope they pulled me through
My father ran to different lands
And not a word we spoke
But I was here to conquer fear
And bring some glory home
Theres a world of hate and sorrow
Out there standing in your way
Theres a load of compromise
Before you die
And each time you step forward
You get burned a little bit
No longer know the way
To say goodbye
Now Im down here underneath
Your bedroom light
Oh, Rena please come out
With me tonight
I look in through the window
And I thought Id take my chance
I taught myself to play
So I could be where people danced
No higher call than stars that fall
I waited patiently
A thousand miles of pavement
That became my destiny
You can wait a lonely lifetime
Wondering when its gonna come
You can while away the hours
Getting stoned
Yeah, one day you get lucky
And you look in someones eyes
That tell you, you dont
Have to be alone
Now Im falling back
Just out of your sight
Oh, Rena please come out
With me tonight
Oh, now I know the way things go
And what I put you through
'Cause when they try to get to me
They get to me through you
I know its not the kind of hurt
Thats easily set right
And I know you got your reasons
To stay inside
Oh, but nothing ever happens
When its left out on its own
You locked in there with
Just your wounded pride
Im down here and Im
Way too tired to fight
Oh, Rena please come out
With me tonight
Oh, Rena please come out
With me tonight

Last night was bad my doubts were all I had realizing I was alone
And trying to think of someone to phone but no one came to mind
There was nothing for me to say
That just anyone would understand
I was scared and afraid I was so alone
We're neurotic we've had it!
Surround myself with people but I'm always alone human props small talk keeps silence from imposing my own mind my worst enemy it will destroy me slowly more coffee more coffee more coffee
I'm going numb
We're neurotic we've had it!
It's hard for me to explain
It's hard to understand all the fear and phobia that lays inside and traps this man when I'm surrounded I wanna scream and kick down the walls destroy what hold me I wanna smash it all
We're neurotic we've had it

When you're lost and lonely
And you feel you can't go on
In the blink of any eye, you could throw it all away
You can turn your world around
Show them all what you can do
Just believe, and trust your heart to see you through
A dream so real, you can feel it in the palm of your hand
So hang onto tomorrow
And never look back again
[Chorus]
Hold the dream
Don't ever let it go
Hold the dream
Don't ever let it get you down
When they turn their back on you
Just do what feels right for you
You can find what you're looking for
Don't get lost along the way
Always be strong. Your heart can't be wrong
Don't give up and your dreams will come true
A dream so real
You can feel it in the palm of your hand
So hang onto tomorrow
And never look back again
[Chorus]
Hang onto tomorrow
Hold the dream
Don't ever let it go
Hold the dream
Hold the dream
[Chorus]
Hang onto tomorrow
Hold the dream
Don't ever let it go
Hold the dream
Hang onto tomorrow
Hold the dream
Don't ever let it go
Hold the dream
Hold the dream

Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F Kennedy
No more messing 'round
Playing with Monroe
No more turning on
The middle aged ladies
All I remember
Was his sporty young hairstyle
All I remember
Was the Catholic Day
Kennedy died in '63, poor John.F
Kennedy's wife
With his brain on her knee
Poor Jacky, Kennedy's wife
With his brain on her knee
Poor Jacky Kennedy, poor Jacky
No more rocking chairs
Sitting on the front porch
No more soft drugs
Playing the space race
All I remember
Was you levi sta-prest
All I remember
Was the Catholic Day
I see the chickens
Have come home to roost
I see the chickens
Have come home to roost
I see the chickens
Have come home to roost
I see the chickens
Have come home to roost
I see the chickens
Have come home to roost

You'll turn away calling back as you run
Say it can, that it can, that it can be done
You're the last continental bastard chosen son
It may be a while, maybe two, maybe three
Till the chance, till the chance, till the chance we meet
Just to burn all the frames as to not repeat
Like anyone anywhere has the time
Take a place, take a place, take a place in line
'Cause I can spot a scab, I know my kind
I want to say, truly say, I know this well
Look how far, look how far, look how far we fell
You can lie to the liar, I know your tell
Turn around, turn around
Say what you want to say
Say what you came here for
Turn away, turn away
From everything we want to work
And anything that came before
You'll turn away calling back as you run
Say it can, that it can, it can be done
You're the last continental bastard chosen son
Turn around, turn around
Say what you want to say
Say what you came here for
Turn away, turn away
From everything we want to work
And everything that came before

Got a number
Got a number scribbled down
Got me running
And jumping the rooftops now
Where the slow-mo shows
The things a blink would miss
(The mo-pho glows)
Ringing in the abyss
Oh
Dial me up, dial me up, dial me up
Dream me a rainbow
Cought the thunder
Sprung from the colliding clouds
Got the dragon the swallowed the sun
(Spit it out)
Where the slow-mo shows
The things a blink would miss
(The mo-pho glows)
Ringing in the abyss
Oh
Dial me up, dial me up, dial me up
Dream me a rainbow
And I rust, and I rust, and I rust
With a heart of chrome
Let me start at the ending
In the place your phantoms swim in
Can you be a friend to me
In the way you're a friend to him?
And I don't know how
Or why a by the by
Should be a golden house
Where we arrive
So let's stop the pretending.
Oh
Dial me up, dial me up, dial me up
Dream me a rainbow
And I rust, and I rust, and I rust
With a heart of chrome

This time you think that you were right,
now I can sleep tonight without you,
so don't say you know what this is like.
You'll bite your lip until it bleeds,
you'll make this simple,
maybe you're just crazy,
but it doesn't faze me.
I'm never one,
to feel the things you do,
the way you do,
but this is what I'll say to you.
I don't think it's fair for me to sit around and wait,
I've been waiting here forever.
I don't think it's fair for you to make me feel the way I do,
now that we have grown together.
All you wanted was a crowd,
I'll make this simple,
maybe it's the right way,
maybe it's the wrong way.
You're always singing,
but you were never seeing,
just what I need from you,
so this what I say to you.
I don't think it's fair for me to sit around and wait,
I've been waiting here forever.
I don't think it's fair for you to make me feel the way I do,
now that we have grown together.
In my life, I'll see you again.
But next time, I hope that you will understand.

Pull the car over you're frightening the kids
What did you promise us about grinning in the rear view mirror without your fake teeth in?
Keep your glass eye glued on the end of the highway up ahead of us
The collision is always licking it's lips
You weren't supposed to open the door
Just keep the plane from drifting off course
We'll attend to the terrified first class convinced there's a hoof print on the bow
All hail the wounded heart contingent
Who've given us something more than faultlessness to sing about
Long live prosthetic live wires
The faulty mechanism of hope has disintegrated
Your captain nailed his feet to someone else's ship at the sight of me
Do what your mother tells you and put down the sheriff's horse
The choir on the black box rejoiced splendidly, singing hallelujah the king is dead
The king is dead

My life flows on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation
I hear the real, thought far off hymn
That hails the new creation
Above the tumult and the strife,
I hear the music ringing;
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?
What through the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it liveth
What through the darkness round me close,
Songs in the night it giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?
When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,
How can I keep from singing?
In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging
When friends by shame are undefiled,
How can I keep from singing?

Oh little Jeannie, you got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes and give it to the likes of me
Oh little Jeannie, she got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can, you make me all a man can be
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh Jeannie, you were always someone's fool
Little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years, you still retain the fears of youth
Oh little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast, searching for some lasting truth
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh Jeannie, I will always be your fool
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh oh Jeannie, I'm still in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie, I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie, I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie, I'm so in love with you

Whispered from my heart and soul to my unwilling eyes
Lift my vision from the ground lift it to the sky
Skies they used to be so ugly rain that stings my face
Opens up their glory just earth and sky and space
And your passionate embraces absolve me of my sin
Your life lifts me up so I can see
See the sky again
And I've lived through all the flash-fire set off like lightning spark
Yes they burn so brightly and oh they burn so hot
And these fantasies of all our love tearing at the ground
Wrapped up in the vortex of sweat and sex and sound
And your passionate embraces absolve me of my sin
Your life lifts me up so I can see, see the sky again
Hide me
From the love I'm too scared to send
Hide Me
'Til I see the sky again
And your passionate embraces absolve me of my sin
Your life lifts me up so I can see
See the sky again

He's the joker in the pack
Wrecks the common track
And leaves just unrecognition
And he moves like a truck
Along with lady luck
Fear, hate and desperatio
I ain't no king
I ain't no ace
'cause I've never seen such grac
Throw me aside
And I'll still come back
Throw me aside
'cause I'm the joker in the pack, Hey!
Watch the black sheep
He's going real deep
He fights his own little war
And he knows the deal
The wounds won't heal
The world keeps knocking on the door

I got birds in my ears
And a devil on my shoulder
And a phone to the other
And I can't get a hold of her
And what's a crush to do?
What's a crush to do when he can't get through?
Medically speaking you're adorable
And from what I hear you're quite affordable
But I like them pricey
So exaggerate and t-t-t-t-t-t-trick me
Pretty please, just trick me
Pretty please

And a devil on my shoulder
And a phone to the other
And I can't get a hold of her
And what's a crush to do
What's a crush to do when he can't get, through?
I'm obsessed and stressed with this mess
I can't think of things
To write down
To type down
And these fingertips are moving faster than these lips
So you can only imagine how jealous my mouth is
So you can only imagine how jealous my mouth is
I got birds in my ears
And a devil on my shoulder
And a phone to the other
And I can't get a hold of her

We'll make this purchase count
Medically speaking you're adorable
And from what I hear you're quite affordable
But I like them pricey

What's a crush, what's a crush to do?

Sooner or later
you'll get tired
while we wait for the bomb
closer and closer
Give it to us
So far you've run
So far you've run
Sooner or later
you'll expire
while we wait for it all
Give it to us
So far you've run
don't say you're with me
'cause I'll be runnin' out
SO FAR YOU'VE RUN
DON'T TELL ME "NO"
DON'T TEAR THE LINE
BETWEEN THE DREAMS WE HAVE NOT FOUND

No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross, this sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand
Well I know how much you care
Don't be cross, this sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me I want you here
Nightmares become me it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me it's so fucking clear

Won't take me home, I'm sweetness to the bone
I'm silken and discreet, amiable and cheap
Meat for you to pound, to beat and smack around
Holes for you to fill with anything you will
But I won't apologize for the things that I do
I am victimized but so are you
There is nothing I've not seen, I'm bruised but I'm clean
If you're turned off by my tracks just get up on my back
I'm prouder than you'd guess, I'm honest more or less
For you I will not pretend, I'll never be your friend
I won't apologize for the things that I do
I am victimized but so are you
Love knows these lips, never kissed before
And at my fingertips are the secrets of a whore
Bring me to your lust
You're cursed and you are weak
In myself I trust
In my bed you leak

there is too much that is ugly
there is too much that i cant stand to sink my teeth into everyday
anger is behind it
its what we believe
and the systems that guide it are here and to stay
make and match promises with every little slut that comes your way
its just your way and thats my way of telling you
that i dont care about your friends or family or anything you hold so dear
i am just what i am
and i'll take just what i give
burn out the bastards
burn out the whores
take what you can because they will take yours
take everything left at your feet
take everything and then it is complete
burn out the coffins
burn out the graves
let all that is dead be a memorial to hate
there are greater hells than this
what are you without me
what am i without you
we are forever

Slackjaw live in the cellar
They let him grind the trash
Clumps of hair and puke and bones
Piles of broken glass
Finds pictures of pretty girls and hangs 'em on the wall
Likes people when he meets 'em
But he just as soon strangle 'em all
Slackjaw sleep on the floor
Of the boiler room
All night long, playin' its song
Clank and hiss and boom!
Sees people on the hall
Smiles and says hello
But sometimes, he wishes
They all had only one throat
Slackjaw he got a worm
That lives inside his head
Tells him things he shouldn't know
Things are better left unsaid
Trash smasher, rat catcher
Piss on your parade
Sometimes he screams all night
To make it all go away
Hey! Slackjaw, hey, hey

Well it looks like I'm a dumb ass, I dropped the ball again
'Cause the woman I love is pissed at me saying this has got to end
Now I tore it up late last night - got way too drunk, it's true
Can I somehow make it up to her? Is there anything I can do?
You've got to tell the girl you're sorry for anything you ever said
Tell the girl you're sorry for making her wish she was dead
Tell the girl your'e sorry for leaving her alone and cold
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such an asshole
So she tells me she's getting really really tired of the crap I tend to pull
Like showing up where she works naked covered in baby oil
Now I'm trying really hard, trying really hard, trying to keep my evil side in check
But sometimes you just gotta kick the cat and deal with what you get
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such a selfish jerk
Tell the girl you're sorry for not caring that the kitty got hurt
Tell the girl you're sorry 'cause the two of you still ain't wed
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such a shit head
I'll say I'm wrong
Will this take long?
No need for you to go on and on
I earn my keep
Just give me peace
I swear I love you
Let me sleep
Now it seems that I must apologize even though I think I'm right,
'cause lordy knows, hone, if I don't there will be no nookie tonight
So I slowly turn to the woman I love saying, "baby, baby, baby please"
Then I watch her smile and point to me saying, "Get down on your knees and..."
Tell the girl you're sorry for everything you never said
Tell the girl you're sorry for giving really lousy head
Tell the girl you're sorry for feelings you can never show
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such an asshole

If I reached the end would it
Ease my mind to leave it with you?
And memory please remember me
Because you're all that I have
I can stand alone, if all on my own
Forget our names
Let's escape from this fading world
Run for cover, we'll run for cover
Don't watch this die
Save your eyes from this burning world
Run for cover, run for cover
I wanna go but there's no where
To stay outside of your love
And I have to live with the things
I say but nothing is mine
I can stand alone, if all on my own
Forget our names
Let's escape from this fading world
Run for cover, we'll run for cover
Don't watch this die
Save your eyes from this burning world
Run for cover, run for cover, yeah
Run for cover, run for cover
Forget our names
Let's escape from this fading world
Run for cover, we'll run for cover
Don't watch this die
Save your eyes from this burning world
Run for cover, run for cover
Forget our names
Let's escape from this fading world
Run for cover, we'll run for cover
Don't watch this die
Save your eyes from this burning world
Run for cover, run for cover

Somewhere down in Fullerton
there's a place we used to go
to get away from it all
Somewhere down in Fullerton
there's a place we used to go
to get away from it all
But I'm still trying
just to figure out why
this feels so wrong
when it felt so right
Felt so right four years ago
So please don't go away
Won't this feeling
stay with me forever,
forever, I said
"please don't go away
I just want you to
stay with me forever"

there's a place that meant
so much to everybody like me

She's the last girl I thought I'd ever see here
But there stands the preacher's daughter holdin' a beer
A tattoo of an angel on the small of her back
How cool is that
She probably don't remember me, it's been a long long time
About then she turned around and kinda stared at me and smiled
She said I had the hots for you in Sunday school class
Now tell me how cool is that
How cool is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool when no-ones in sight
When I'm the one shes lookin' at with that look in her eye
About then I asked if she was still seein' old what's his name
She said has it really been that long, no, a lot of things have changed
She brushed her hair back and said let's not talk about the past
How cool is that

Everyone beneath the sun
Is dreaming dreams
Scheming schemes
Wanting what they haven't got
Chasing golden beams
I'm like the rest it's quite true
Sweetheart I want something too
I don't want the happiness gold can buy
All that I want is you.
I don't want my share of the sunlit sky
All that I want is you.
I don't want the roses that bloom so fair
I just want your love to be true
The rest of life's joys
Are just worthless toys
For all that I want is you.
Sweetheart true, if you but knew
The hours I've spent
Love's lament
Wondering, dear, when skies would clear
To my heart's content
I hold your love as my goal
I'm yours alone heart and soul!
I don't want the happiness gold can buy
All that I want is you
I don't want my share of the sunlit skies
All that I want is you.
I don't want the roses that bloom so fair
I just want your love to be true
The rest of life's joys
Are just worthless toys
For all that I want is you.

You know I try so hard
But I think you don't see
'Cause' I'm moving so fast
We call it rock n rollin'
My weapon seems usless
'Cause' your on to me
You are impossible to read
You're always straight controllin'
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Gon' doo a voodoo until
You feel my power now!
You know I feel so smooth
I'm always struttin' when in motion
Make the little girls dance
'Cause' I'm rock n rollin'
It really doesn't matter
If you're hard to please
'Cause' when you give me your smile
I'm yours for straight controllin'
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Gon' doo a voodoo until
You feel my power now!
You know I try so hard
But I think you don't see
'Cause' I'm moving so fast
We call it rock n rollin'
My weapon seems usless
'Cause' your on to me
You are impossible to read
You're always straight controllin'

Poetic madness, drains from my mind
You've fucked me there too many times
Heart in throat, I'm all choked up
Heart in throat, I'm all choked up
I wish I was
Now give me sanity
This is the love, I can't control
And now you've lost it
And you're just so fucking crazy
You make me crazy
Dope sick and depressed
But she's magnetic
She's so magnetic
You , you make, you make me
You make me crazy
You make me so fucking crazy
Fucking crazy, fucking crazy
A bittersweet orgasmic mind fuck
Or the smoothest sheet of something stainless
Will pleasure me for now
And now I find myself where the needle was too weak
And now I find myself where the razor couldn't speak
Now cover me
In your green essence, lovely
Distance, where I can't touch you
That's where the gun will touch you
Paint up your pretty face
You're something I wish I was
Paint up your pretty face
Give me this agony
Paint up your pretty face
Paint up your pretty face
Paint up your pretty face
Her makeup smears away
With the tears
That eyeliners runnin'
And she's runnin' away from me
The lipstick stains like gold
And for that moment
I wanted to be her
Feeling, how I failed her
Right now, the drama bites hard
You're the poison in the bottle
In that, just knocked me out
A simulcast signing off, yeah
Mind controls a bitch
I'm on that downer depressant
That overcast chill
And she's just so fucking sexy
Yeah, lips like sin, die like sin
Lips like sin, die like sin
I'm on that downer depressant
That overcast chill
She's dressed in black and dressed to kill
Lips like sin

Even grey suits have their day
all the promises they made
all the bad words you can't say
you signed up now fake it
you signed up now make it
you signed up now make us proud
the best is yet to come
the best is yet to come
seeing how they break you be honest
you want it nothing else will do
it's never enough for you
it's never enough for you
it's never enough for you
and even grey suits have their way
all your friendships find their graves
in the lounge where you write
they are lost
and you are found
the weather's fair in the clouds
you signed up now make them proud
the best is yet to come
the best is yet to come
the best is when you're falling from your throne
yeah you bought it it's never enough for you
you bought it it's never enough for you
you bought it it's never enough for you
you bought it it's never enough for you
you bought it it's never enough for you
you bought it it's never enough for you
you bought it and you hold on

There i stood in the night
Out on the broken pier
Me with my feet in the sea
You with your face in the clouds,
The man in the moon
And as i heard your voice,
Felt your laugh
Flood across the broken pier
I wanted to die right then and there
You smiled down across the waves
As if to say to me
"everything will be okay,
Be strong and true"
And i felt your eyes
Like the tide
Pulling me out into the air
For a moment in time
You held me there,
Father and son,
Home again'

Polite to say that I drifted away and I never though I'd care
Along the way I've made mistakes but I made them over there
If I told you twice I'd beat it, what you never thought I'd beat
If I told you I survived in your pig society
You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what lies inside and you never want to see
Locked away in a cage today, so I'm doin' what I can
Take these fuckin' chains off me and I'll show you what I am
You don't know what its like to be in me
You don't know what I've survived and you never would believe
Sick of politicians and politics and prisons, lyin' and runnin' my life
You pathetic preachers and hypo critic leaders smilin' and wastin' my time
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Survive the hate of this fuckin' place and I'll call you when I can
Some snitch fucker died last night, do you think I give a damn
You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what its lie inside and you never want to see
Sick of politicians and politics and prisons lyin' and runnin' my life
You pathetic preachers and hypo critic leaders smilin' and wastin' my time

If you're in the right city at the right time
What's the last thing going through your mind
Not talking 'bout your, ask no questions, you know it's a lie
You're just a victim of a corporate crime
All the signs of a shark attack
You've got rivers of blood on the streets, don't look back
Nothing personal, just another snack
'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns
Any fule kno that
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit
Just trying to keep her happy
There's no laughing in heaven, not the one, not the seven
And you'll never get to heaven in her row boat
Pea brain pisser, dog breath kisser
'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns
Any fule kno that
Any fule kno that
Any fule kno that
Ooh
Won't it be nice
When everything falls into place
Salad days go a-tickling by
Have a high time, burn money in the meantime
They bleed you dry
Those suckers are smaller than life
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit
I'm better off sticking to my guns
Any fule kno that
Any fule kno that
Any fule kno that
Ooh
Won't it be nice
When everything falls into place
Danny went down to the river one day
Didn't come back, that's the last, they say
We ever saw of him, that's no lie
Spitting in your eye, have no fear
You don't want the truth
Stick your finger in your ear
Any fule kno that
Any fule kno that
Any fule kno that

I am
heart
of the devil
I have
heart
of the
devil
I can make a man
freeze in his tracks
I can make a man
fall to his death
I can make a girl
so eager to please
I can make a young girl
lay down
for me because
I'm evil
and
love is gone
I can make the skies
thunder and shake
I can make the world
tremble and quake
I can make your pulse
pound in your veins
I can make your heart
stop
and start
again because
I'm evil
love is gone
I can make the world
tremble and shake
I can make the skies
black in my wake
I can make a girl
so eager to please
I can make a young girl
lay down
for me because
I'm evil
and love is gone
my love is gone

Sinking to the bottom while rising to the occasion.
Slipping through your fingers now you've been caught red handed.
If you wait for a sign, they will take you alive.
You'll be sorry then, you're not innocent yet, you'll be sorry then.
Access denied at the door, progress won't be granted.
Distress on the intercom, accept what can't be restored.
If you wait for a sign, they will take you alive.
You'll be sorry then, you're not innocent yet, you'll be sorry then.
They've been told to open fire if you're in their line of sight.
Your escape should be inspired by imposters in disguise.
Evidence, evidence
They won't give up till you're found by the spotlights in the sky.
In the distance there's the sound of a million sirens.
Evidence, evidence, evidence, evidence

Still born by mercy
I fall to the floor
I have no excuses
I have nothing more
Forever in slavery
Bonded by chains
Silently waiting
For all that all that remains
Your perfect kiss
It's dying
Your secret desire
Blessed is the motherland
Safe for little children
No trace of obsession
Binds me to this
You feel my flesh
And I taste your kiss
Burning temptation
So pure and so pale
Lovers for ever
In secret secret desire
Your perfect kiss
It's dying
Your secret desire
Blessed is the motherland
Safe for little children

Springfield's looking pretty dusty today
I see their dreams coming undone
The view from inside ward nine affords this much
A town teeming with the unloved
Close the window and lock it so it's good and tight
Turning eighteen and trying not to look too lost
Have a not so nice day
The jacket makes me straight so I can just sit back and bake
You know I think I'm gonna stay
Talking very loud but no one hears a word I say
Come visit me tonight at eight o'clock and then
You'll see how I am not the crazy one
Voices tell me I'm the shit
Twenty days go by and every day looks the same

Father owned the dating bar so mother ran the store
We all lived there together with the army at the door
No one to do my laundry or to tell me that they're sure
But there really is no me and there's no army at the door
I hustle my way to your bedside
I ride on your body like a cab ride
I carry refreshments to the good guys
I made the good guys some home fries
Pardon me anyone where is the nearest shore
We're all in this together and the police are at the door
Someone do my laundry or smash through the floor
To the tropical vacation buried underneath the store
And I was your favorite bullfighter
Whose looks were new to your eyes
And I fell apart in that bullfight
Where the dress was the sky to your thighs
She said that she had an hour
Her father he was in the shower
And she took me to her little tower
And she showed me her little flower
And just when I thought it was safe to put down my pen
She said maybe I will let you fall in love with me again
Maybe I will let you fall for loving me again
Then she showed me her badge and I think she said then
That I don't have the heart to tell you not to come
And everyone has hands just to use someone
And it makes me feel just like old gum
To ride a fake horse into town
To ride a lame horse into town
To ride a dead horse into town
To ride your big fucking fake fucking lame fucking dead horse into town

On the day of her arrival
No one is there to meet her
Something of a sad one
A girl with permanent tears
Born without a family
Born without a name
All she ever wanted
Was to wipe her tears away
Wipe her tears away
Away........away
If someone came to love her
And if someone came to be
The one that will protect her
Be a family
Now we will see a smile again
And tears like dreams can be
Something we will never see
Lost in her memory
Wipe her tears away
Away..........away
Wipe her tears away
Tears away......away.......away
She's something of a tragedy
Stands in the shade of despair
I want to cast some light onto her world
A world of permanent tears
Born with out a family
Born with out a name
Free this weeping willow
From drowning in a flood of tears
Wipe her tears away
Tears away......away......away
Wipe her ...

AHHHH...The Lord is a monkey
Thanksgiving's coming on the Fourth of July
In the form of a girl with a needle in her eye
Well she come from out west on a nickel's worth of gas
Got her mind on her money and a dope up her ass
Outside of Phoenix where her gimmick broke down
Fucked that cracker for his rig and she was out of that town.
HA HA HA HAA
Well she was a hare krishna in the ashwam bed
She was sellin' (?) Had a funky-ass head
Well she put food in my mouth and she threw me on the bed
And she cut off my balls and she sewed 'em to my head
Well she's headin' back east in a 57 Caddy
Got her mind on her money and a dope for her daddy
Well I met her on the street, where she beat me like a fool
Then she got me accepted to an ivy league school
Well I really did good but it's kickin' my ass
I lost 38 pounds and my eye turned to glass
Well she's looking pretty good first week in July
She's got a dope up her ass and a needle in her eye
Thanksgivings coming on the Fourth of July
In the form of a girl with a needle in her eye
Well she come from out west on a nickel's worth of gas
Got her mind on her money and a dope up her ass

She goes downtown in a pair of old blue jeans
(Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go)
She's the kind of girl who knows what bein' dry means
Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go
Oooo ooo ooo ooo, well, look at her go
Yeah, look at her go
She heads for the beach with the radio on full blast
(Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go)
She skis with ease down a snow-filled mountain pass
Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go
Oooo ooo ooo ooo, well, look at her go
She can find her fun 'most any place
(She has fun now any place)
Stayin' at home or goin' to a hot dog race
The guys are standin' in line to take her out
(Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go)
She knows what to do when the band plays "Twist & Shout"
Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go
Oooo ooo ooo ooo, well, look at her
Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go
Oooo ooo ooo ooo, well, look at her go
She skis with ease down a snow-filled mountain pass
Little Miss Go-Go, Little Miss Go-Go
Oooo ooo ooo ooo, well, look at her go
She can find her fun 'most any place

There's a wild wind blowing,
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing
there's a cold war coming,
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world
Oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I could hear it coming
I could hear the sirens sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Time came a-creepin'
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes o-o-on
Time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night
Oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I could hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Gravity release me,
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground.

Baby work me
'Till I won't look more
Baby work me
'Till I won't look more
Want you to work me baby
Lord how, make me feel it
Want you to do me
Baby I will do you to
If you do me
Baby I will do you too
Want you to work me baby
Lord how, make me feel

Musical ladders
Leaning on mountains
Bathed in white laughter
Under the sun
Somebody's birthday
Came stumbling towards us
Wrapped in green gladness
Under the sun
We're gonna to make it through this war tonight
Someone hold this child up to the light
Prostitute fingers
Fumbling with matches
Tucked in red couches
Under green moons
Mexican waitress
Got caught in the crossfire
Of militant families
Bursting with jews
We're gonna break it to your folks tonight
Kind of hope your pops don't hear me right
Ooh yeah

Check me pout before you go
Time you've got to really know
You got this wonder show to... all the times that you're here
All the love that you feel
Come right down and take you away!
Soldier, I get broken... there's a letter on the shelf
Guess she had my.. to feel the sign all that time that you're here
All the love that you feel
Come and down and take you
Love that you fear!
Calm right down and take you away!
Come down from where you are, where are you are!
Come down from where you are where you are!
Now's a time our ...
Knowing that...it will never be you away
..all the times that you're here

Head to toe rayon, don't light a match
We were good and we're starting from scratch
Going to a place that never existed
And probably never will, yeah
Oh, a blue light basement on a throw-down autono(mous) zone
Where we dim the lights and we're really not that lonesome
Leave your context at home and leave your irony at the door
Tonight we'll even the score
Well, tonight we mean it
When we dance
Well, tonight we mean it
When we cry
Well, tonight we mean it
When we laugh
Well, tonight, tonight yeah, yeah
I know everybody here would love to get down
And to wipe the slate clean new
And do what they want and say what they mean
And eliminate the, uh, existential quandaries of modern, uh, postmodern
(bourgeoise) reality, ya dig?
No issues! No motives! No problems! No questions!
Just sexy people and purity of intention
Sounds so good, I can barely bring myself to mention
It's my sad, sad invention
Well, tonight we mean it
When we dance
Well, tonight we mean it
When we cry
Well, tonight we mean it
When we laugh
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I lost my invitation and I don't know where I'm going
I might just drive around and try to listen for something weird
Yeah, you're welcome to come along.
Well, tonight we mean it, yeah!
When we dance
Well, tonight we mean it, oh
When we laugh
Well, tonight we mean it
When we cry
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I got me a job on the local paper
Everybody there thinks I'm nice
But they'd better look twice
Cause it isn't me
I want to be
Headline hustler
Scandal maker
Headline hustler
Money taker
You keep writing me letters
But I haven't got time
I'm busy looking at photographs
But they'd better not be from the BBC
You're gonna hear from me
Headline hustler
Scandal maker
Headline hustler
Money taker
Better not turn around
I'll stab you in the back
And you don't know what I'm hiding
Under my plastic mac, under my plastic mac
I got a very good friend in the CIA
And he says that he never takes bribes
But he's telling lies
Cause he's into me
He knows I want to be
Headline hustler
Scandal maker
Headline hustler
Money taker
If your brother's wearing dresses
And your neighbor's swapped his wife
Well, I'm gonna make the headlines
With your private life
With your other wife

[Chorus:]
I write your name on my arm with India ink
Baby I told you once before it's not what you think
I drink it in with a sip
But I really want to chug
You know I take what I can get
Give me a dub, now
[Bridge]
So good, so good
Come on now, I wish you would
Anytime I get together
Get to feeling like I could
I write your name on my arm with India ink
Baby I told you once before it's not what you think
I drink it in with a sip
But I really want to chug
You know I take what I can get
Give me a dub, now
So good, so good
Come on now, I wish you would
Anytime I get together
Get to feeling like I could
[Chorus:]
Woah are you with me [Repeat: x1]
Woah is that the best you can give me
Woah are you with me
I write your name on my arm with India ink
Baby I told you once before it's not what you think
I drink it in with a sip
But I really want to chug
You know I take what I can get
Give me a dub, now
You're even cuter
When you get crossed
Just stamp on your foot
And try to be the boss
I write your name on my arm with India Ink
I'm hanging on every word cause the way that you think
Yes every misstep well it led me to you
I'll do what I got to do to see it through
If you see a shooting star
Celebrate with a kiss
Won't have to wait far
When no one will ever miss
[Chorus]
Woah are you with me [Repeat: x1]
Woah is that the best you can give me
Woah are you with me
I'd carve my name on my arm
But you'd be alarmed
That I did it
I admit it
A big swing and a miss
So I'll keep my distance
Back in it
In a minute
[Chorus]
Woah are you with me [Repeat: x1]
Woah is that the best you can give me
Woah are you with me
Woah are you with me (name on my arm with India ink)
Woah are you with me (told you once before it's not what you think)
Woah is that the best you can give me
Woah are you with me
(Name on my arm with India ink, baby I told you once before it's)

Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
The three-date theory is getting old
Everyone is getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I'll be moving on, moving on
Moving on, and on and on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on and on and on
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

I am, I myself alone,
and realise, I never had to use no-one.
When it comes down to my soul,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
There was a time I was so afraid
Of everything people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows
There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan I thought could not fail
But no power under the sun, could pull it together
I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question
I am, I myself alone
Realise I never nedd to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads,
Freedom puts my faith in none above.
If there's a time, that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there -
To kick at the answer
I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question
I am, I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am, I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy road,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am, I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy road,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
(None of the above)
(My faith in none of the above)
(None of the above)
(I stand by none of the above)
(None of the above)
(I stand by none of the above)

Heaven haunts me; kill for a cigarette
Heaven is all that I got
My god left me without one word of warning
My god left me waiting is all that I got
I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger, crashing down
All my life, I've seen your babies
Crashing to the ground
Needle brought me comfort to keep me stable
Comfort paid for
Comfort is all that I got
My god left me without one word of warning
My god left me
My god is all that I got
I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger, crashing down
All my life I've seen your anger
Crashing to the ground
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger, crashing down
All my life I've seen your babies
Crashing to the ground
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid

Your eyes won't open
And I can talk until I'm blue in the face
I want you to die a simple death
Like a heart attack or a bullet in the brain
To this sound
Every time I turn around you say something
And all I hear are empty words that die
I wish I could have said or felt your stare instead
But I know it's too late for that now
I'm sorry I let you down
And I'm probably the one you'll blame
But I want to die a simple death
Like a heart attack or a bullet in my brain

Come see what we all talk about
People moving to the moon
Stop baby don't go stop here
Never stop living here
Till it eats the heart from your soul
Keeps down the sound of your
Silent sigh
Silent sigh, silent sigh silent sigh
Keeps down all move me down
Could we love each other
Come see what we all talk about
People moving to the moon
Stop baby don't go stop here
Never stop living here
Till it eats the heart from your soul
Keeps down the sound of your
Silent sigh
Silent sigh, silent sigh silent sigh
Keeps down all move me down
But don't love each other
No don't love each other
Never gonna be the same

I think you're amazing
Everything you do and say
Just blows me away
I can't stand to be alone
I can't stand to be without you
Without you
All I do is think about you
I know you're waiting for an answer
I could never tell you
I would never say
This would be easy
But it's okay
'Cause you'll be coming with me
Are we hanging by a thread
Have I pushed you to the edge
Pray to God that it's okay
I hope every thing's okay
And I won't let you get away no no
I know you're waiting for an answer
You say you can't wait on no more
I could never tell you
I would never say
That this would be easy
But it's okay
'Cause you'll be coming with me
So, I'm counting up the days
Like I always do
Yeah, I'm counting up the days
Until I'll be with you
I know you're waiting for an answer
You say you can't hold on no more
I could never tell you
I could never say
This would be easy
But it's okay
'Cause you'll be coming with me
Girl you're coming with me
Yeah, you're coming with me

All to hell we must sail
For the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller
Than the God we once believed in
Till the butcher and his crown
Raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes
That haunt tobacco island
'Twas 1659 forgotten now for sure
They dragged us from our homeland
With the musket and their gun
Cromwell and his roundheads
Battered all we know
Shackled hopes of freedom
We're now but stolen goods
Darken the horizon
Blackened from the sun
This rotten cage of Bridgetown
Is where I now belong
All to hell we must sail
For the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller
Than the God we once believed in
Till the butcher and his crown
Raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes
That haunt tobacco island
Red leg down a peg
Blistered burns the soul
The floggings they're a plenty
But reasons there are none
Our backs belong to landlords
Where branded is there name
Paid for with ten shillings
Cheap labor never breaks
The silver moon is shinin'
Cools the copper blood
Where the livin' meet the dead
And together dance as one
All to hell we must sail
For the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller
Than the God we once believed in
Till the butcher and his crown
Raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes
That haunt tobacco island
Agony, will you cleanse this misery?
For it's never again I'll breathe
The air of home
From this sandy edge
The rolling sea breaks my revenge
With each whisper a thousand waves
I hear roar, I'm coming home
Dark is the horizon
Blackened by the sun
This rotten cage of Bridgetown
Is where I now belong
All to hell we must sail
For the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller
Than the God we once believed in
Till the butcher and his crown
Raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes
That haunt tobacco island
All to hell we must sail
For the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller
Than the God we once believed in
Till the butcher and his crown
Raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes
That haunt tobacco island

I used to see those red tail lights
Heading for another town
And wish that I was on my way
Looking back on those summer nights
I was wasting time, fooling 'round
And there was nothing here to make me stay
Oh, but that night I met you
The night you came through made me realize
There's no way I could leave
You made me believe and now when I look in your eyes
I could walk through fire, I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby, I would walk through fire
It's crazy how these things work out
I used to think I had no chance
And I somehow thought you'd slip away
You pulled me through the fear and doubt
Gave me all I'm looking for
Everything I needed to stay
How could something so good
Something so simple, get serious?
How could someone so right come into my life
And now I just want you to know
I could walk through fire, I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby, I could walk through fire
And I would go anywhere, I would do anything
I do what you want me to, you know that I would
I want you to know that whenever you need me, yeah
Ooh, wherever you are, no matter how far
You know I'll be coming for you
I could walk through fire, I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, to get right back to you
And when the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
And baby, I could walk through fire
Baby, I could walk through fire, right back to you
And I could walk through fire, and I could walk through fire
And I could walk through fire, right back to you, yeah

I hate the way you won't let me go out on friday nights
I hate the way you try and say I need to live my life
I think that I am doing just as well off on my own
Why don't you go away dad and leave me all alone
I remember those times you told me to stay away from dope
Dad take a look at your
Son Now
I hate the way you make me stay in and do all my chores
It's such a hassle it seems that I'm always doing yours
I hate the car lectures you give me on the ride home
While blasting Aerosmith on your fucking radio
I remember those times you told me to stay away from girls
Dad take a look at your
Son Now
I remember those times you told me to stay away from booze
Dad take a look at your son now

I got it in the mail one morning
There was no return address
Just my name in gold leaf on the front
There was no time or location
There was really no info at all
No date no place no time no RSVP
But it said:
You are invited by anyone to do anything
You are invited for all time...
I didn't think much about it
It seemed like a really dumb joke
But later that week it was Friday once again
So I took it down to a disco
That wouldn't have me in am million years
I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink
I really didn't stay too long there
'Cause no one was having much fun
I made my way to a party all the way across town
It was thrown by the friend of an ex-thing
I wasn't sure if I should go
But when I got in the place there were smiles all up and down
I grabbed my ex in the kitchen
I told her I was sorry I came
But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said:
You are invited by anyone to do anything
You are invited for all time...
You are so needed by everyone to do everything
You are invited for all time
I headed home kinda early
The party wasn't all that great
I saw my neighbor out crying on his front porch
I stopped to see what his deal was
I couldn't catch much through the sobs
Something about a party and he didn't go
I thought about it for a second
The invite in my hand
I threw it down at his feet and I said:
You are invited by anyone to do anything
You are invited for all time...
You are so needed if you really want to go
You are invited for all time
For all time

[Chorus]
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Wake up time to fly
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Ah ha, ah ha ha, yeah
Ah ha, ah ha ha, well
Ah ha, ah ha ha
Ah ha, ah ha ha
There's someone knocking on my door
A tall dark figure I've never seen before
His badge shone brightly like a star in the sky
Drag me out to the waiting car
[Chorus]
A flock of vultures spinning round my head
Left me on the roadside for dead
Cars pass by but no one stares
These waking dreams, they never end
[Chorus]
You we gotta try
Lawman on the bank now, honey
Hound dog on my trail
Wake up time for freedom
Before the night prevails
There's someone knocking on my door
A tall dark figure I've never seen before
Yeah, backs on blinding, like a star in the sky
He drag me out to the waiting car
Sometimes, like this, they came
Ah ha, ah ha ha, yeah
Ah ha, ah ha ha
Ah ha, ah ha ha, yeah
Ah ha, ah ha ha
[Chorus: x4]
Wake up time for freedom, baby
Freedom

Whenever I try to hold my baby
She just stand there for a while
No matter how I try to please that woman
She won`t even crack a smile
Lord, maybe you in heaven can help me
`Cause this is one evil child
Oh, I say maybe, maybe somebody can help me
Because this is one evil child
When I buy her flowers or candy
She just looks at me and growls
She say, "You must be guilty or have a guilty conscience, buddy"
Because I`m convicted without a trial
She just grunts when I call baby, hmm one evil child
I said, "Lord, maybe you can help me, because she`s a strange and evil child"
Still, I`m tryin` to please my woman but she's `bout to drive me wild
I buy her hundred-dollar dresses, people
Still she complains about the style
Won`t somebody give me a suggestion?
Help me with this evil child
Oh, maybe the Lord in heaven above can help me
'Cause, I'll tell you, she's an evil child

On my own again, left alone
To remember when
Her love filled my life
Made my life alive her love
Love around me
How can I cope without the love
That I had
(all around me, love surrounds me)
Surround me
The love that I lost was more than
I could hope to find
(love surround me, all around me)
Around me
Did I have love or did love have me
Oo love around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own
Mmm mmmmm mmmmmmmmm
Mm
I gave up our love
But it won't disappear
Oo love around me
Desire
Seems as though
Everywhere I go
Oo love around me
Put your arms around me
Huggin' and a-kissin'
Making the love I've been missin'
All around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own

I'm in the need
Of someone to confide
Surrendering, 'cause I'm not as strong as you'd think
Uncommonly, this desire that holds our eyes
We need to dig deep
You see that I can't put reason our cover up
Better than most
Yes I cover up better than most
I'm surrendering
And I can't believe
You were ever on my side
And who holds the keys?
Of who I am, and why this life
And I want to be free
Indecisions from all sides
You need to dig deep
To see that I can't put reason our cover up
Better than most
Yes I cover up better than most
I'm surrendering
All this blame that we lay on our mothers our sisters our lovers our faults they're ours to hold
So I need to dig deep
You see that I can't but reason
Somebody please give me something to hold
Something to know why I'm feeling alone
Beginning to think that the older we get
The more we think the less we know
[Guitar solo]
I'm surrendering
I surrender
'Cause I can't put reason our cover up
Better than most
Yes I cover up better than most
I'm surrendering
Yes I Cover up better then most
Yes I cover up better then most
I'm surrendering
'Cause I'm in the need of someone to confide
Surrendering, cause I'm not as strong as you'd think

I pulled my kerchief out of my pocket
Wiped my nose and said hello
I bought a tambourine at the millennium dome
It jangled 2000 times in a row
I caught a cold when I was way down south
Standing out in the heat
Now my eyes are all itchy
And I can't tell which way to walk down the street
I'm stumbling through the crosswalk
And I'm humming in the din
And when I get to the other side
I'm gonna jangle my tambourine again
I fished my microphone out of Regent's Canal
Heading from Little Venice to Greenwich
Dirty boy said let's make in love in the water
I said, No thanks, pal.

There's nobody
There's no mountain
There's no tunnel
You can't get from there to here
You can't get from here to there
There's nobody
There's no mountain
There's no tunnel
You can't get from there to here
You can't get from here to there
There hasn't been a change in the atmosphere
Nothing twisting round, burning down, coming round
There hasn't been a change for over a year
Slid it through, ride it through, hiding you
There hasn't been a change in the atmosphere
Shut it up, roll it up, follow you
Pull the tap
Give it a stab
There's no atmosphere
Dig a tunnel
Through the mountain
How many atmospheres are out there
There's a telephone
There to here

There is a statue - out on an island
Lady Freedom's got nothing much to do
Just stands alone, her face set in stone
It reminds me of me... without you
And in case you didn't get my letter
I ain't been making any head-line news
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you
Millions of people... I'm that much more lonely
I'm seeing you - in every single face
My mind's insane, my heart's in pain
Without you here I feel so out of place
And if it makes you feel any better
I ain't been doing things we used to do
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you
Too late to explain - why I came here
It was just something that I had to do
But take it from me - you're all I need
'Cause I'm still in love with you
And if it makes you feel any better
I ain't been making any head-line news
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you

you crawl across the floor
on your hands and knees
to seek revelation
little whip
I pull you up
I grab your hair
I give you hope
little whip
I give the black sun
to sear off your tongue
I gave you a life
little whip
a come on little whip
a come on little whip
a come on little whip
a come on little whip
I pull you up
I grab your hair
I give you hope
little whip
I gave you the world you behold in a dream
I gave you a night cry
little whip
you lick your wounds
and you come right back
I give you nothing
little whip
I send the black sun
and eclipse your moon
I steal your hope
little whip

Smoke stack blowing, there's a fire in the sky
Fahrenheit rising, oh, higher than high
Pressure's building up, sparks are gonna fly
I know where this is going when I look into your eyes
I know where this is going when I look into your eyes
Sweet sweat's rolling down the middle of your spine
Bodies move together, perfect rhythm and time
Baby say my name, I'll write yours in the sky
Higher than a rocket in the fourth of July
Higher than a rocket in the fourth of July
It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Only fools count treasure in silver and gold
I don't want for nothing that these hands can hold
If you need something done, put it on the list
And if I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
If I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
One taste of your lips, every night, every day
I know every curve, but it's never the same
If love is a fire, I'll go down in flames
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Give everything I've got, I can't get enough
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love

We all live
Somewhere near nowhere
On dusty roads there
All soft and free
You said I feel no pain
Where are you going
With number nothing
Unnaturally
It's the feeling that can't be lost
It's another that you can't explain
It pulls on strings like falling in love
Instant love instant love
Only you asked to go lower
And don't you just know it
Dead fingers falls
A star fades out of my heart
But you laughed and just rolled and rolled over
Everything slowly goes
You said you knew and that's what you wanted
If time gone is history
Then this is a victory
A victory worth losing for you
And all you need
It's the feeling that can't be lost
Its another that you cant explain
It pulls on strings like falling in love
Instant love instant love
You said I feel no pain
Where are you going
With the number three

your days of sorrow will soon be gone
but don't worry now it won't be long
we'll make you happy we'll make you stay
you won't get out of here any other way
sign your name on the doted line
because right here is where you start doing your time
the seclusion rooms where you'll stay
for the first seven days 'till we think you're ok
your actions will be charted
everything you do
your doctor will be here to talk to you in person
you've been diagnosed as a chronic depressant
no control of your mind
a disturbed adolescent
pitty and sorrow seem to rule your world
life's vicious circle has taken it's twirl

Unopened door
On the 13th floor
Conspiracy in the corridors
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
What should you say?
What can you do?
Satellites are watching you
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
At this dark hour
Who'll be there?
Open the door
If you dare
Venus fly trap on the stairs
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
There'll be no time
There'll be no tears
The elavator disappears
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
Cripples crown
Cripples crown
Cripples crown
Cripples crown

Well, when I got your letter, I could not contain
The urge to go beyond our inheritance again
And the drug of ages, in pages of your pen
I got to put it down
Maybe you got glazed by all the shit you had
To taste for to descend, to let me in
Maybe it's okay now if you turn and run away
Anesthetic days of crusades and consent, the idiot intent
And though our love was likely your disease is so competent
You're so proud of the few risks you've taken, child
But no it's nothing new, we all continue
Maybe it's okay now
If you turn and run away, well, yet again
Vacant above the din, vacant above the din
[Incomprehensible]
I tried to dissuade the agents in your mind
Who'll rape and campaign until you resign
And I'd return your letter but I'm feeling unrefined
I'd rather put you down
Vacant in the eyes as you conform
And compromise yourself in sense
And like pretense
Maybe it's okay now
If you turn and run away, well, yet again
Vacant above the din, above the din
Above the din, above the din

Mirror in the bathroom
Please talk free
The door is locked
Just you and me
Can I take you to a restaurant
That's got glass tables
You can watch yourself
While you are eating
Mirror in the bathroom
I just can't stop it
Every Saturday you see me
Window shopping
Find no interest in the
Racks and shelves
Just a thousand reflections
Of my own sweet self, self, self
Mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Recompense
For all my crimes
Of self defense
Cures you wiser
Make no sense
Drift gently into
Mental illness
Mirror in the bathroom
Please talk free
The door is locked
Just you and me
Can I take you to a restaurant
That's got glass tables
You can watch yourself
While you are eating
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom

I want to see you with tears in your eyes
You make me petty, sold by your lies, lies, lies
I don't like the shoes that you wear, the air you breathe, the cut of your
hair
I remember nothing
Each fossil sends me from time into mine
A petty revulsion that I cannot hide
I don't like the way you fell down
It ruins my story, twists it around
I remember nothing
We don't have any stories to tell
It's always the same, we take what we find
Don't go down south they don't like your kind
Inside, inside, inside, and you're out of time
I remember nothing
Maybe life is over in the place we have to go
Nothing left to know, nothing left to know

Musical revolution spreading through the land
Big city White boys, ready to make a stand
Angry, tattooed, and scarred,
We're really a nasty bunch
Stand in the way of our pride
We'll give you the knockout punch
Sub-Chorus:
They say we've got freedom of speech
Yet they try to censor our voice
We'll just turn up the volume
We won't give you a choice
Chorus:
We're musical terrorist, angry White males
We're the true Minnesota Vikings
From St. Paul we hail
We like it hard, we like it loud
We shout it out, cause we're White and proud
We're rock-in against the industry,
You can kiss our ass MTV
We're musical terrorists hail! hail! hail! hail!
We're musical terrorists hail! hail! hail! hail!
We're musical terrorists hail! hail! hail! hail!
We're musical terrorists
And we hail you
Turn off the radio come and open your ears
Don't listen to that garbage
That promotes hippies and queers
Open your eyes, be a man, take pride in yourself
For you hold the key, to your heart,
You and no one else
(Repeat Sub-Chorus)
(Repeat Chorus)
We're not the spirit of 69, we're the spirit of 88
We're the true sons of Odin that love to show their hate
Under the deathhead and the runes
We march into this glorious fight
Some may think we're crazy,
But this is our way of life!
(Repeat Sub-Chorus)
(Repeat Chorus)

She's got buttons with their name on it
Lost sounds, well they tell you everything
And it all goes back again
Well
And it all goes back again
[Chorus]
I said
"Victory at Monterey"
She said
"Won't you come down and play"
That's sad
You didn't win anything
That's sad
Victory at Monterey
Happy
Man I got lost in you
Well I'm over these, over these
Gonna find you
I'm so glad
Now that I have you back
Happy, happy
'Cause I know it's true
Now that I have back
[Chorus: x2]

Draw me again into the center of your love
Where I began I know that you are still enough
Lord you restore all the desires of my heart
Just like before when I discovered who you are
I need you more
I need you more than ever
I need you more
Jesus I need you more
I will abide, be still and know that you are God
For you are mine, and in your presence I'm alive
Here in this place, within your shadow I am safe
Every mistake fading into the light of grace
I need you more
I need you more than ever
I need you more
Jesus I need you more
Be my heart's obsession, first and only in my life
In your love alone my soul is satisfied
I need you more
I need you more than ever
I need you more
Jesus I need you more

Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road
He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need
And then very carefully he'd proceed
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white
Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light

Oh my precious ember burning, my sweet glowing light
From the moment I first saw you I was yours and you were mine
Deep down we both knew you were trouble by design
And the echo of my mother's words, "baby don't you play with fire"
I was always playing the part first love only set by a spark
There was no way changing my mind
Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back, no where to run, no where to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god is this real no more time
It's too late, it's too late to say goodbye
I can hear the sounds of sirens circling around
Forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground
Deep down we both knew it was trouble by design
And the echo of my mother's words, "baby don't you play with fire"
I was always playing the part first love only set by a spark
There was no way changing my mind
Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back, no where to run, no where to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god is this real, no more time
It's too late, it's too late to say goodbye
After all the dust has settled, we can settle down
Just the two of us forever, no one else around
No one else around around, around
Now I'm under your spell, trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back, no where to run, no where to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god no escape, no more time
It's too late, it's too late to say goodbye

Sat here thinking about my heart
All of the places it came apart
There's just one thing that I need to know
Why am I always chasing the rainbow
Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uh huh
I ran through the meadow looking for a dream
Truth is never like what it seems
I guess there's always so far to go
Why am I always chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it get it uh huh
Where is the light
Where is the love
Where are the dreams that I once had
Frittered away
Gone in the time it takes to get from there to here
Get it get it get it
Get it get it get it uh huh
Get it get it get it chasing the rainbow
Why am I always chasing the rainbow
I'd draw you a picture cause it just might help
To point out the place where we went so wrong
The only color I'd use is blue
Why am I always chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it get it uh huh
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Why am I always chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Why am I always chasing the rainbow
Get it get it chasing the rainbow
Get it get it get it uh huh

What's that you're saying when you're talking to me?
The feeling's changing why can't you see
You say it's over, well I don't care
You say you're sorry but life's not fair
You broke my heart yeah yeah yeah
That's what you're saying yeah yeah yeah
And now you're sorry yeah yeah yeah
That's what you say yeah yeah yeah
And now you want for me to believe
That we were not meant to be
You said it was over, before it could start
You said you're sorry, but you broke my heart
What's that you're saying when you're talking to me?
The feeling's changing why can't you see
You say it's over, before it could start
You said you're sorry, now you broke my heart

A squat greek sips his ouzo
fingering his gold neck chain
robust corn-fed american beauties
lick the salty rim of margaritas
in the corner lies a comatose musician
dreaming on the job again
you can't buy love
but you can buy friends
upon her breast a shiny crucifix
holier than me i guess
sheds friends like a snake sheds skin
her laughter sounds so venomous
in his corner lies the once proud musician
thinking on the job again

Stay in the light
shadows in the light
We are..
I have burned to throw myself
awake to escape
deny it all
out of the humdrum
there are some who share our views
and some try to deny it all
ignoramus
if it is fate
deal with it
your blood is red
mine is too
just deal with it right away
you deal with the right way
the rat race of the week
I'm fool wonderful I've been doing this since i was in school
dancing dilemmas
do you know that questions can tear your apart in
all directions
beating the humdrum
experiment a little bit
your blood is red
mine is too
just deal with it right away
deal with it the right way
how
the rat race of the week (3x)
round and round
we go around
still our heads get awfully numb
today
a little bit a day

i don't have shit but i don'y t really give a fuck
i'll live a life of misery before i'm giving in
complacency and security
don't do a fucking thing for me
every freedom you think you've got was given
and just the same it can be taken away
ask yourself if your really free
with your pointless job and life of conformity
[Chorus:]
if you think they'll get me like they've gone and got you
then you got it all wrong you got it all wrong
if you think i'm ever giving up or ever giving in
you got it fucking wrong
it's been 23 years of the same old shit
and i still havn't found a way i can deal with it
you've tryed to knock me down with your authoity
but your fucked up fucking laws don't mean a thing to me
you say that i'm wrong but i know that i'm right
because what did any of your laws ever do for me
nothing but protection for the privilleged few
there's something i ain't got and it ain't nothing that i want
those rich fucking bastards still stand tall
while me and you we ain't got nothing at all
working and slaving getting nothing in return
don't you think it's about time the tables get turned
i don't want wealth or the american dream
it's all a sham i won't be part of that sceme
if you think that it's okay and you buy into that con
then fuck you to because you got it fucking wrong

Mexican Moon
Oh, amigo
Here we do things slow
Money, art, a broken heart
Where did you want to go
Senor, por favor
To the hotel, Zona Rosa
What did I come here for
Oh, senor
I run but the damage has been done
Miles have gone away
And my amore he never come
I look up at the sky
I am tired and dry
Uno Tecate and lime.
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moon
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moon
Senor, you are wise
I can see a million years
A million tears behind your eyes
Take me home
Take me to the Zona Rosa
Mariachis and tequila
I will dance the night alone
Just some time
Just a little kiss of mine
Take me where I can forget, senor
You are so very kind
I look up at the sky
I am tired and dry
Dos Tecate and lime
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moon (2x)
I look up at the sky
I will try not to cry
Tres Tecate and lime
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you underneath the Mexican moon (4x)

Mother said, "Come home"
Father said, "Come home"
Sister said, "Come home"
So my friends said "Come home"
And I said, "Let me be, I'm alright
Can't you see, I'm just fine
Little skinny, okay
I'm asleep anyway"
Then I heard a voice
Said "Son you have a choice"
I then slapped my face
Let me be, I'm okay
I'm awake anyway
It's too bright over there
I can shift, cannot steer
So I drive them away
For a while, then I stay
Little skinny, okay
I'm awake anyway
Now I have to go home
Do as, when in Rome
Let me be, I'm alright
Can't you see I'm just fine
Little skinny, okay
I'm asleep anyway
Let me be, I'm okay
I'm awake anyway

Away with the buff and the blue
And away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the . . . and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Her father loves her well, her mother loves her dearer
I love them better than them both but, man, I can't get near her
Off with the . . . and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
If only I could be lying there aside her
While I must bide here, my arms'll be denied her
Off with the . . . and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Her skin is like the silk and her hair is like the silver
Her breasts are deep and cool, they'll warm when I get near her
Off with the . . . and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Ah, this love of mine, oh, this love, I am weary
Sleep I can't get none for thinking of my dearie
Off with the . . . and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Away with the ?gilded? shield and away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Away with the buff and the blue
Away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the . . . and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

I am limbo, waiting on a window
Stuck inside an interval
I know it's unattainable
Covered by a label's name
Labeled by geography
On a dying dark horse
Placing
I am a plagiarist
Feeble picking up a pen
Between a sonic precedent
Any age I represent
Old enough to own the store
The noise I make, like an arrogant ingrate
I'm not noteworthy for a loyalty
The forefathers who are redeemed
Most of whom I never revered
Never needed or never even heard
Emulating individuals
Cloning the new originals
Follow us for king land rituals
I am a spokesman for a derivative
Travelling salesman
Selling old narrative
True sounds of liberty
Straining through my voice
Only heard in their code
One noise
Once an introvert
Spewing my entire worth
Regurgitating their words from it
Second coming, a second strings
They're personating the real thing
The odd guys that wrote bad songs
A drug addict's dead and gone
Who wrote the song that sold my voice
Forcing to make my choices
And the name they chose for me
And the name chosen for me
Finally, here I am
Said to be made again
Posing weathered statues
Standing on old attributes
Getting sick of this
Feeling ridiculous
I'm an overtold joke's punchline
I am limbo, waiting on a window
Resonating old song
You're not so long
Scraping the bread off my forehead
At the speed of nearly dead
I never found what never made
To the sound I've already betrayed
It's the name they chose for me
It's the name they chose for me
Follow us for king land ritual

I smoked a pack of cigarettes before midday
I coughed up a lung around one
I can't see a thing through my eyes that sting
I can't remember having so much fun
I've never had so much fun
Can't drink the water in Sydney
Can't eat the food in Japan
Can't breath the air in Los Angeles
but a million people think they can
These wankers filled up with hatred
Why expect any less
They can't decide about genocide
I think it's time that they took a rest

Maybe you should work for "sick of it all"
Or get a job with the LAPD
Did someone switch your Ritalin with ephedrine?
Just don't take your fucking problems out on me.
I'd buy you a little fuzzy bunny
I'd put you on my x-mas card list
If you'd promise not to take your job so seriously
And realize you don't have to be so pissed.
Life ain't all that bad. life ain't all that bad.
Even if Henry Rollins is your dad.
Life ain't all that bad. life ain't all that bad.
Buck up little camper, don't be sad.
Maybe you could go hunting with Ted Nugent
And see how many animals you could kill.
I'd pay all of my friends just to hang out with you
And take you out to sizzler for a meal.

The best good looking girl in town is checkin' you out
You get your rocks off a cock block 'cause it's a long way down
Let 'em all just wait in line, it's fine, 'cause what they got, she doesn't want
You play it cool, relax, ease back, and get in the zone
The girl's attractive, she knows she's pretty
She gets exactly what she wants it's silly
All the boys fall down but you just stand your ground
Take her to the side and say
Tonight is fine
(Tonight is fine)
Tonight is fine, baby
They all try to tease her and please her and make her believe
But the best thing they going for them is some coke and bad weed, hahaha
The girl's attractive, she knows she's pretty
She gets exactly what she wants it's silly
All the boys fall down but you just stand your ground
Gotta learn to seize the day so you take her to the side and say
Tonight is fine
(Tonight is fine)
Tonight is fine, baby
(Tonight is fine)
Tonight is fine
(Tonight is fine)
Tonight is fine, baby
There should be no hesitation
(Tonight is fine)
When your bid's in for her relations
(Tonight is fine)
When most boys like to talk her up and act bigger
(Tonight is fine)
You make sure you got your back to her
(Tonight is fine)
Now I'm not sayin' along the way you won't get messed up
Every time you do you goin' get more tough
And even when the coast is clear
You gotta pick your spots
Tonight is fine, hehehe
She's so hot, she knows she's pretty
She gets exactly what she wants it's silly
She got you out of your mind and going giddy
Gotta learn to seize the day, so you take her to the side and say
Tonight is fine
(Tonight is fine)
Tonight is fine, baby
(Tonight is fine)
Your place or mine girl?
(Tonight is fine)
Tonight is fine
That's right wooh
(Tonight is fine)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Tonight is fine)
Who am I kidding
(Tonight is fine)
Every night, every night, every night is fine
(Tonight is fine)
That's right... with you

I'd be really pleased to meet you, if only I could remember your name.
But I got problems with my memory, ever since I got a winner in the fame game.
I'm a citizen of Legoland, travellin' Incommunicado,
And I don't give a damn for the Fleet Street aficionados.
But I don't want to be the backpage interview.
I don't want launderette anonymity.
I want my handprints in the concrete on Sunset Boulevard.
A dummy in Tussauds, you`ll see. Incommunicado.
I'm a Marquee veteran, a multi-media bonafide celebrity.
I've got an allergy to Perrier, daylight, and responsibility.
I'm a rootin-tootin cowboy; a Peter Pan with street credibility.
Always making the point with the dawn patrol fraternity.
Sometimes it seems like I`ve been here before,
When I hear opportunity kicking in my door.
Call it synchronicity, call it deja vu.
I just put my faith in destiny; it`s the way that I choose.
But I don`t want to be a tin can tied to the bumper of a wedding limousine;
Or currently residing in the where-are-they-now file.
A toupe on the cabaret scene.
I want to do adverts for American Express cards,
And talk shows on prime time TV;
A villa in France,
My own cocktail bar;
And that`s where you`re gonna find me.
Incommunicado.
Sometimes it seems like I`ve been here before,
When I hear opportunity kicking in my door.
Call it synchronicity, call it deja vu.
I just put my faith in destiny, it`s the way that I choose.
Incommunicado.
It`s the only way.
Incommunicado.

I got greed, it's got me
I got freeze, it's on me
I can't breathe, I can't see
I just bleed, I just be
I can't see straight, I can't be straight
I just want a life of my own
I can't live hate, I don't want hate
I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
You walk away from me
You walk away from me
My soul leaves, my soul breathes
My heart aches, the ground shakes
You can't beat it, you can't feed it
I can't see straight, I can't be straight
I just want a life of my own
I can't live hate, I don't want hate
I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
Yeah, I just want a life of my own
You walk away from me
You walk away from me
You walk away from me

Hey bitchery,
You stole enough from me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go home now
In this misery.
You've had enough of me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go home now
Where there's easy love,
And there's easy life.
Dream on me
When you sleep.
Keep your head
Where you said it would be.
Dream on me
When you sleep.
Keep your head like you said.
Hey bitchery,
You stole enough from me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go home now
In this misery.
I've had enough of me.
I gotta go.
I gotta go home now
Where there's easy love,
And there's easy life.
Dream on me
When you sleep.
Keep your head where you said it would be.
Dream on me
When you sleep.
Keep your head like you said,
And you said, like you said, like you said.
Dream on me [Repeat: x3]

(dokken, hughes)
I could've told you
All these tears, what good to they do
All these years my life's been living
It's a shame you've not been giving
So tell me what to do
And I'll be there for you, only for you
Chorus:
When love finds a fool like me, it doesn't see
When love finds a fool, baby, like me
I could've been the one
Sad empty faces look to my eyes
They seem to know me
I can take the rejection
All I need is your affection
I should've ssen it coming
You should've said 'goodbye'
I guess you were right
Chorus
Solo

Motherfucka let's show up tonight
You can call a taxi
I can ride a bike
Bazooka tube on my shoulder
It's getting colder
I need to hold her
Stop!

When I run through the world
With my dick in hand
When I punch you in the face
With the bass and a plan
You will never be quite the same
'Cause it's AWOL!
You can say my name
You were upside down
You were backside up
With the windows down
When the lightening struck
The great depression of the airwaves
So kill the suit and the DJ!
Motherfucka are you listening to me
Motherfucka are you moving to the beat
Motherfucka time to take it to the streets

Motherfucka time to take it to the streets
Yeah, yeah, yeah

In a political state
Carries no weight
No consideration
Your future's at stake
Yanked out of school
For a factory before you can read
Once the world's shoven down your throat
You'll find that it's hard to breath
They'll march you to work
In sickness or in health
You're never paid what you're worth
No family wealth
Soon your wages
Support the state
Support the party
Then you'll scream
"Forget the C.W.P"
Tell 'em for me
I'd kill to be free
Tell 'em for me
I'd kill to be free
No religion to comfort your mind
The Communist Manifesto will be read all the time
When consumer products cease to exist
That's when the eastern blocks defects
Tell 'em for me
I'll kill to be free
Tell 'em for me
I'd kick ass to be free
Resist 'em communism
Resist 'em fascism
Resist 'em nazism
Resist 'em now

One hundred miles to drive, a word that whispers in my mind
I've found that truth still rhymes sometimes
A soul searches for signs, the highway smiles with our headlights
A Savior smiled in my head
When the light shines on my face, the world becomes so small
When the night finds me this way, I know I'm not alone
When the light shines on my face
A parable is told of seed that fall beside the road
When other ones are sown, a thistle grows to choke the rose
And the good ground shows a vine that grows upon the wall
The vine of life will lead us into a love that frees us
When the light shines on my face, the world becomes so small
When the night finds me this way, I know Im not alone
When the light shines on my face, the chains are broken off
When the light shines on my face, when the light shines on my face
With me come one and all, follow me to this sacred place
Follow the love that falls on every heart to wash away
Every wrong and fault, every bitter thought today
You can find freedom, you could be saved, you will find freedom
When the light shines on your face, the world becomes so small
When the night finds you this way, you know you're not alone
When the light shines on your face, the chains are broken off
When the light shines on your face, when the light shines on your face
When the light shines on my face

Freddy wants to be a cartoon superhero and he never goes outside
His eyes are glued to the TV screen most every day and night
S'not making friends at school, his parents have concerns
But he always tunes in and tunes them out wishing one day he would get his turn
Freddy never ever studies and he's proud of his straight C's
And chain smoking in the parking lot pretending to be James Dean
Kids call him a freak and a weirdo and he won't won't amount to anything
While psychologists get paid to analyze his anti-social tendencies
Late one Saturday night drinking beer and getting high
He got struck by lightening twice and decided to leave that life behind
He always told me that one day he'd be king of the world
And the weak and the meek shall inherit the earth
Better check yourself and watch your step cause
He's the comeback kid...he's coming back
Now Freddy is a young shorthaired suit-wearing corporate middle manager
Making $90,000 a year he keeps his wife knee-deep in pearls
Seems he pulled it together and should be sitting pretty for life
But staring out his hi-rise corner office window, he's not feeling that satisfied
Then one Saturday night working late he started to sigh
Where did the all the good times go, where's that kid I used to know..
He always told me that one day he'd be king of the world
And the weak and the meek shall inherit the earth
Better check yourself and watch your step cause
He's the comeback kid...he's coming back
Quit the job, leave the wife, and get a few tattoes
Play guitar every night and start singing the blues
He always told me that one day he'd be king of the world
And the weak and the meek shall inherit the earth
Better check yourself and watch your step cause
He's the comeback kid...he's coming back, he's making a comeback

I've been down this road before.
It's like the back side of my hand.
And there ain't nothing up ahead
the cow pasture and timberland.
So don't you worry baby I'm gonna take it nice and slow.
I'll keep a tight grip on the steering wheel and my eyes on the road.
Just this one time,
I promise I won't ask again.
It'll be our little secret,
honey I won't tell a soul
and if I see somebody coming I'll be sure to let you know.
Everybody does it, don't you be ashamed.
We'll still make the movie, we'll just be a little late.
Let me love you on a backroad.
Let's make a wreckless memory.
There ain't a house within ten miles of here, no.
So nobody's gonna see.
Take your seatbelt off and climb on over here girl,
leave the driving up to me.
If we get too hot and heavy there's a place where we could go.
Down this worn out huntin trail a half mile off the road.
And we might not make it back there in this little two wheel drive.
But judging by the way you're kissing me it's at least worth a try.
I'll turn this Mustang into an F250 4x4.
And if they catch us back there we'll probably go to jail.
But I'd clear out my bank account and Id gladly pay the bail.
And I promise I'll still love ya, and maybe even more.
I won't think bad about ya girl, I know you're not a oh Lord.
Let me love you on a backroad.
Let's make a wreckless memory.
There ain't a house within ten miles of here, no.
So nobody's gonna see.
Take your seatbelt off and climb on over here girl,
leave the driving up to me.
I'm rock hard, you're so hot.
I think I'm turning blue.
Come on baby please, you know I'd do the same for you.
Let me love you on a backroad.
Let's make a wreckless memory.
There ain't a house within ten miles of here, no.
So nobody's gonna see.
Take your seatbelt off, get a little comfortable, and leave the driving up to me

Fed up with myself
Staying inside
Why bother getting up
Cold hard words
Meaningless words
On just how much a life is worth
I submit to live a life feeling left over
I submit to live a life where I have nothing
Let's blame the mailman
We are numbers
On your frame
The voices in the other end
Who would care
When I give up
As the gold keeps coming in

(welcome home... lets hide away... before they see...i need so much... to be alone with you... i do ... i do...)
"welcome home" she said to me,
"let's hide away before they see. i need
so much to be alone with you, i do, i do (i do, i do)"
"come with me" (come with me) she took my hand, "please try to help me understand"
so pointless when my heart has
turned to stone, i know, i know...
i wish i didnt need you now,
and i wish i didnt need you now,
and i wish i didnt need you now,
i need you now , i need you now...
"i wish we could" she whispered near,
"go someplace far away from here." (go someplace...far away from here)
while hoping, that small voice would disappear ...
that said "welcome, to the end..."

Dreams
All those silver dreams
Though destined to be broken
Still linger in my memories as tarnished pages
Loves
That have been and gone
Left saccharin and ashes
Scattered in a wind of silent indifference
Light the way, light the way
Where do I belong?
Light the way, light the way
Oh, where do I belong?
Tears
Bitter sweetened tears
Have left their burning traces
Of bridges soaked in kerosene and expectation
Light the way, light the way
Where do I belong?
Light the way, light the way
Where do I belong?
Hopes
For a time of peace
Left many broken hearted
For causes that are lost are felt far more deeply
Light the way, light the way
Where do we belong?
Light the way, light the way
Oh, where do we belong?
Oh, where do we belong?

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Standing at the water's edge
I dropped my dreams when I dropped my nets
No hesitation, no regrets
I followed You
But that was then
And this is now
You washed my feet and You changed my name
I swore I'd never be the same
But just like the tides, I guess people change
'Cause that was then
And this is now
I wish I could go back but I don't know how
I remember when I stood my ground
I swore I'd never let You down
I want to be that man again
But that was then
And this is now (Whoa)
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
I watched the blind man lift his head
And look his Savior in the eyes
I heard a dead man take a breath
Dropped to my knees as I watched him rise
And I felt the sea beneath my feet
As I stepped out on the angry waves
But You saw the storm raging within
You reached out and calmed me then
But this is now
I wish I could go back but I don't know how
I remember when I stood my ground
I swore I'd never let You down
I want to be that man again
But that was then
And this is now
Just when I thought my sin has closed the door
I see my Savior standing on the shore
With arms wide open
Just like the first time You called my name
You said that was then
And this is now
My child, I bore your cross, I wore your crown
When you couldn't come to me, my love came down
So take My hand, I'll lead you out
'Cause that was then
And this is now
My child, I bore your cross, I wore your crown
You couldn't come to me so my love came down
Take my hand, I'll lead you out
You'll never be that man again
'Cause that was then
And this is now (Whoa)
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

I was all smiles
When I signed on the dotted line
And after these thousands of miles
I don't know what in life is mine
And what's been taking from me
There's so much I could say
But I don't know where to start
Where to start, where to start
I took the bullet and I never thought twice.
I'm always the coolest when there's money in their eyes
Let's burn down this angel town
Let's burn Hollywood to the ground
Cynics all around
They wear masks I wanna see
They make audible sounds
But never say anything
How can I give you my life
If there's nowhere left to go
When it's over I took the bullet, took the heat, I took the fall
I guess I was foolish to believe after all
Let's burn down this angel town
Let's burn Hollywood to the ground
They took all my dreams and all of my things
My family counted on me
And I can't let them down
Let them down
Let's burn Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood, Hollywood lied
Let's burn down this angel town
Let's burn Hollywood to the ground
They took all my dreams and all of my things
My family counted on my
And let everyone down
I let you down
Let's burn down Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood, Hollywood lied

I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free
But it sure is hard to do
It sure is hard to do
I know they say if you don't come back again
Then it's meant to be (so they say)
Those words don't pull me through
'Cause I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill
Climbin' up a hill
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kinda love keeps breaking a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye
Sometimes I ask my heart did we really
Give our love a chance (just one more chance)
But I know without a doubt
We turned it inside out
And if we walked away
Would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep running on a carousel
Goin' 'round and 'round and never getting anywhere
On a wing and prayer
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kinda love keeps breaking a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

[lyrics:Jason Kohnen]
I hear the music
sweet tunes that caress my soul
music begging for music
it woes my soul ...so...
it enchants me...
...feeding my hunger
but I'm hungry for more
...so much more..
food for the poets thought
ink for the thirsty pen
lust like the ravaging whore
bringing on her final encore

We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say-
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
The foes that oppose me by proxy,
They try to get foxy
They try to rock me
They say they got the 40 cal glok
With the 30 round clip
And they losing their damn grip
Well, I came back from hell so God damn fit
I'll bust your lip, and make you strip
You can play them games
But don't play'em in my park
I'll spill a wild bill, before you get out you Town Car
Ranting and raving, claiming you're armed
I'll do the hit myself and then eat a chicken parm
Mackin' like bumpy, the business is boomin'
I'll chop your ass up like I was Jimmy Coonan
The westy, honey don't test me!
Ooooh - I just ate 5 blotters
And things are gettin' kinda wacked!
If you can't live the lie, let it die
And if you can't live a life full of strife
Just say oops! And jump through hoops,
And get to the end of the line.
And get to the end of the line.
We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say-
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
I got bear huge for my brothers
And I got no love for the others
C'mon kids, you ain't built for bids
You'll get jacked in the ass like a sucker
"Mucho dinero" the man with the hat said
He changed his mind once the crack in his head bled
Movin' and shakin' the brittle illusion
Referring, concurring, and workin' out solutions
We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say-
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
If you can't live the lie, let it die
And if you can't live a life full of strife
Just say oops! And jump through hoops,
And get to the end of the line.
And get to the end of the line.
Know your man, know his game, don't be ashamed from where you came,
If you ask me, I'd rather have money than fame.
We got the crazy crew
You think you coming we say
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
"Na na na" we got the block locked up
Na na na

It was on the news this evening, twelve years for what he did,
kicked to death a four year old, an innocent little kid,
burnt her with his cigarettes, beat her black and blue,
her mother stood by and watched, I call that sick dont you?
I dont agree with killing, morally I think its wrong,
but if were in the same room, dont think hell live for long.
Would be hanging be answer, would child killers take heed?
Or should we just break their legs, and make the bastards bleed?

You spread out the skies over empty space
Said, "Let there be light"
Into a dark and formless world Your light was born
You spread out Your arms over empty hearts
Said, "Let there be light"
Into a dark and hopeless world Your Son was born
You made the world and saw that it was good
You sent Your only Son for You are good
What a wonderful Maker
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God
No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
And we have only heard
The faintest whispers of how great You are
You made the world and saw that it was good
You sent Your only Son for You are good
What a wonderful Maker
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God
You made the world and saw that it was good
You sent Your only Son for You are good
What a wonderful Maker
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God

Well your face still makes my day 'audience applause'
Just like it did in the past when you turned me away
I kept coming back for more
that's the choice I chose
You were so distant
But I stayed close
It feels like we've weathered the storm
But without having the privilege of calm
[Chorus:]
And when we sing I hear another devil dies
When that bell rings an angel get its wings
And if I pushed would you all fall down
'Cause I don't need this on my back
The hatred will tear us apart
If you won't do what you did at the start
Oh no should I go or will you stay
Will find a plan of attack
there's a price to pay for showing our reaction to all the simple things
In time you will know what I know
But for now you win
The hatred will tear us apart
Another devil will take out your heart
[Chorus]
And when we sing I hear another devil dies
When that bell rings an angel gets it wings
And if I pushed will you all fall down
'Cause I don't need this on my back
It seems like we've weathered the storm
Without having the privilege of calm

Ain't no getting up again,
She gonna bring you down.
Love gone up and jump again,
Turn it all around.
I'm goin' to the liquor store,
To get some peace of mind.
Something I ain't done before,
I can't seem to find.
Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
Give to me, a place in paradise.
Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
And never never leave me.
Sister I am suffering, a single desire.
Hell is the shadow cast from a soul on fire.
Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
Give to me, a place in paradise.
Hold me please, Sister Sweetly,
And never never leave me.

Something like giving Time it flies so don't delay
When she's needing Today will soon be yesterday
Giving all there is Tommorrow she might
And remember this Not even be there
Something like staying When she does what she does
When she's lonely And it doesn't fit
Even though you"re late You'll get by if you try
Everything will wait You'll get over it
Ooh, it's something like loving
If she means so much to you
There's not a thing you shouldn't do Ooh, it's something like love
If it will help to show her that you care. It's something like accepting
Everything about a woman
All the bad things, too
She can change for you
Something like loving
Oh, it's something like love, yeah.
It's a brand new morning
Of a brand new day.
It's a brand new chance
To make it all work out some way.
To right the wrongs
Within the songs of yesterday
It's a brand new morning
Oh, it's a brand new day.

She's a neon girl, She follows that buzz
To where it's found, 'cause she's the scene
Tinsel town calls her the queen
And that's alright, but if you demand spotlights
Get ready to blow
'Cause Heaven steps on false attempts to glow
I gotta know
[Chorus]
Will you be there when they roll out
Bright red carpet?
Will I see you by my side?
Will you be there when we walk on
Bright red carpet?
Will I see you by my side?
He's a stylish guy, he steals a room
Even looks good in everything
Soon Hollywood will call him king
And that's OK, 'cause Armani likes the way
You wear your clothes
But Heaven's gate
Is no place for fashion shows
I gotta know
[Chorus]
You try so hard, and you get what you get
But in your heart
I hope you never forget
A selfish soul will never stroll
on red carpet
[Chorus]

Maybe now
My love can get on its feet
You're my baby now
And that's something no one else can beat
Well, we're back to the good old times
And we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Baby, we're back to the good old times
And that's for sure
Breakin' up
Must've done us some good
'Cause makin' up
Made me love you much more than I could
Well, we're back to the good old times
And we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Baby, we're back to the good old times
And that's for sure
Kiss me now
Just like you used to do
And this is how
I tell if you love me too
Well, we're back to the good old times
And we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Baby, we're back to the good old times
And that's for sure
Well, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong
Baby, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong
Yes, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong
Baby, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong

He wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town
Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter
Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch
She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill
She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover
Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale
She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cause she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while
She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master

Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way
Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way
I wait alone each lonely night
Blue hotel
Blue hotel
Blue hotel
Every room is lonely
Blue hotel
I was waiting only
The night is like her lonely dream
Blue hotel
Blue hotel
Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way
I wait alone each lonely night
Blue hotel
Blue hotel

You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold
Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

Breathing in, spitting out
The bittersweet sugar of life
It used to taste better
Sucking in, pulling in
Emotions I just can't hide
Cheap smiles and promises
Cause we're polaroid
We're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
Hanging on, holding on
To cables inside my mind
Cut loose and crashing in
Serenade, the volume raise
Breaking glass heads and hands
I can't go on living
Cause we're polaroid
We're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
Polaroid, she's living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid, paranoid
You gotta set me free
You gotta set me free...
You gotta set me free
Polaroid, we're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
She's polaroid, we're living in polaroid
Polaroid, it's making me paranoid
Polaroid (Polaroid, polaroid, polaroid...)
She's my polaroid
Polaroid, it's missing in polaroid
Polaroid

He's the footsteps in the night
Shadows gone before the light
Never get to see the face
Of spider man
Catcing flies just ain't his style
If you're crooked stop think awhile
Once bitten - never the same
He makes a black widow look tame
Spider man
He spins a golden web
With a golden thread
That never, never let's him down, down, down
And when the spidercatcher comes to town
He ain't around
Solo

As a young fool, he'd sling molecule
Made his pickup down south, took this club-kid trick
He thought she side-kicked for Molly, she partied
But her heart was real, he'd find out that night
When this pig pulled them with enough
MDMA to be put away for life
No way, how could this happen today
She said, "It's gonna work out today"
"Let's go home, now. Open your eyes,
I did it for us, the feeling is
mutual, right?"
[Chorus]
Baby we'll be fine, as God is my witness,
as God is my witness, we can
get through anything
Cause I shared my love, shared my skin,
endless in this predicament
Laughing the cop made his arrest he
pulled her man from the car
She saw sweaty pig glance at her breast
She said, "I'll make a deal with you,
I'll have sex with you"
"I'll do anything you ask, if you let the
love of my life go free tonight"
No way, how did this happen today
She said, "It's going to work out Okay."
[Chorus]

Mr. Jones knows The Stones
Rock 'n' roll is in his blood and in his bones
Shines his shoes, kicks some ass
Counts the booze and laminates his pass
Does some wizz, loves the biz
Your Eric Clapton's and your Nancy's and your Sids
Mr. Jones helped me understand
The worthless piece of lowlife that I am
Changed the rules took control
Bribing the ref and widening the goals
Mr. J's master plan
Fifty ways to patronize the fans
Life is cheap, buy some now
Satisfy the sheep, sacrifice the sacred cow
Born to boogie, disco Tex
Mr. Groovy, the God of groupie sex
Born to boogie, knows the Stones
The only thing in common between me and Mr. Jones
Verbal gymnastics can't help you now
We've got fifty tons plastic
We're gonna laminate your house
Born to boogie, disco Tex
Mr. Groovy, the God of groupie sex
Born to boogie, knows The Stones
The only thing in common between me and Mr. Jones
Mr. Jones, super cool
While you were out
We were pissing in your pool

You squirt out red and turn so yellow
And then you made me kill my own
I'm not afraid
(Coming, coming)
But I'm afraid
Blood in your eyes again
Bravery, the face of man
Blood on your mind again
Chivalry, the face of man
Blood in your lies
Enemy, the face of man
Blood in your eyes, again
Is this the only path of glory? If so then I won't go alone
Follow the trail
(Running) follow the trail
I'm not afraid
But I'm afraid

I see you're runnin', baby, out of time
I see you're runnin' babe, we're out of line
You got another and you'll go to her
You got another and you'll go to her
Babe it ain't funny, we've got a lot of love
And only God knows where the hell it come from
You got another and you'll go to her
You got another and you'll go to her
I see you're runnin', baby, out of time
I see you're runnin', babe, we're way out of line
You got another and you'll go to her
You got another and you'll go to her
Babe, it ain't funny, we've got a lot of love
And only God knows where the hell it comes from
You got another and you'll go to her
You got another and you'll go to her

Princess is gone, where did she go?

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

I got high on scrapings from my nails
Now I'm back down my eyes are growing dark
My burnt spoon has dried beneath the bed
And I'm dreaming of dirty blue balloons
I've waited so long without you
I've waited too long for you
He came in, he didn't speak my language
I paid him with everything I had
And promised next time he opened up his mouth
And then they floated out dirty blue balloons
Nothing helps and no one else
Can make it feel okay float me through the day
Nothing helps and no one else
Can make it feel alright float me through the night
I can not let 'em go
Dirty blue balloons

I got a car full of stash and I want to sell it
I got some tickets and hash and now I want to sell it
You wanna take out the trash, you wanna go around and tell it
I got a car full of stash, now you can go to hell with it
'Cause I'm about to get myself home
I'm about to get on the plane
So come on over and see it
Just come on over and see it
We want to take your gold
We want to take your gold
Move right in and steal the mold
We want to take your gold
I got some shit on a boat and I want to move it
A crate of guns and a goat and I want to move it
You wanna put on your hat yeah, you say, you need to prove it
You wanna see where it's at, I'm gonna tell you to prove it
Well, I'm about to get on the plane
I'm about to do it
We want to take your gold
We want to take your gold
Move right in and steal the mold
We want to take your gold
And we're gonna get your soul
We're gonna get your soul
The weights are on the scale and they show
That we are here to get your soul
I got a box at my house
And I want you to get it
You know that box at my house
Hey, I don't want you to fret it
For I'll call 'em up in advance
I'll put the key around your neck
I'll be here doin' my dance
And you can pick a card
You pick a card from the deck
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We want to take your gold
We want to take your gold
Move right in and steal the mold
We want to take your gold
And we're gonna get your soul
We're gonna get your soul
Get it in a move so bold
We're gonna get your soul

You feed me all I think I need
You held my hand through all the pain
How come I can't let go of you
Nothing you do for me is real
Whenever I trust in you I lose
Ending it all right here
I can't take no more
Losing it all right here
Although I've tried since we last met
I wish that I had never seen
How good you make me feel I'm numb
Noghint you do for me is real
Whenever I trust in you I lose
Ending it all right here
I can't take no more
Losing it all right here

(ferry/leonard)
I know you - inside me
Like poison like wine
Now theres no sense in falling
Say youll be mine
Give me the world around you
Give me the time
Only a dream without you
Say youll be mine
Ive got - inside me
In darkness entwined
I would be lost without you
Say youll be mine
Reflected in water
Imagined by fire
I will be waiting for you
Say youll be mine
Beware bte noire
Beware bte noire

See the lonely man there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know.
But he waits every day now.
He's just waiting for something to show.
And nobody knows him, and nobody cares,
Cause there's no hidin' place,
There's no hidin' place
For you.
Lookin' everywhere at no one,
He sees everything and nothing at all, oh.
When he shouts, nobody listens,
Where he leads, no one will go, oh.
He's a lonely man there on the corner.
What he's waiting for, I don't know.
But he waits every day now.
He's just waiting for something to show.
And nobody knows him, and nobody cares,
Cause there's no hidin' place,
There's no hidin' place
For you and me.
Are we just like all the rest?
We're lookin' too hard for somethin' he's got
Or movin' too fast to rest.
But like a monkey on your back, you need it.
But do you love it enough to leave it all?
Just like the lonely man there on the corner,
What he's waiting for, I don't know.
But he waits every day now,
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show.

(Just one sec)
(Lavalamps are good)
Traveled on the F train down
The people press and crowd
They start to fade like footprints worn away
Only stop and still I'm waiting
A thousand faces look the same everyone
A thousand different names
They come on two by two
People fade as people do
Came here of my own volition
Could be my decision
Could be
We may still get by
We may still get by
Wandered down on avenue A
The coffee shops, the sweet cache
Of thoughts, and words, and laughter gone
Never-ending stream of what you've
Known so long and long ignored
Don't think so hard, just smoke your cigarette
And fade off into blue
'Cause people fade as people always do

I don't want to urinate
On myself
I don't want to urinate
On anyone else
Well, I guess that really
Doesn't matter anymore
Because I can't control
My bladder anymore
Well, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)
Step back into life
No more soiled nights alone
But I guess I don't have a care
Because there's not a load
In my underwear
I'm sick of offending
Everyone I meet
(Go, go, go, go)
I'm sick of crying myself to
Sleep on rubber sheets (go)
I had an accident today
I left a soil on a bus seat,
I didn't know what to say
But, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)

Hey! What can I say?
Something's on my mind like every other day
Hey! You slow down, I can see you're headed for a breakdown
Go! Go! Take another pill and a real big swig to forget about me
Don't you know by now, you're under my skin like six feet under ground..
Hey yeah, oh yeah, Let's go, the Next Big Joyride [x4]
Now I'm half asleep, now I'm awake
Thought it was a daydream
I'm so horrified 'cause now you see the real me, deep inside
Then I say it's black, she says it's white
I say it's day, she says alright
It's time to run, it's time to hide, get ready for the next big joyride
Hey yeah, Oh yeah, let's go, the next big Joyride [x4]

I see a point and a mountain; I am a drop and a lake. I am a speck and a beast; I cause a quiver, a quake, look close and you will find a place where small is large. In different space the rhythm that the world sustains unfolds and then unfolds again. I saw a tree inside a seed, phi the sky and shells and hives a sky alight a secret world alive. Invisible leaders, invisible laws of two sides; we take none and turn the third way through the wall a thousand times. In a thousandth time a million eyes see the scions rise a billion sons. Apogee begun a trillion hidden lives, perihelion colored lines and scented signs lead us between what we combine afreet. I see the world with clarity hidden world seen by the third eye, the opulence of a clear blue sky. Heaven's been kind enough to grant us entrance to this enchanted land

With a face of stone my wounds are showing
In my room alone my fear are growing
Have I lost my place? Did I fall behind?
Did I fall from grace? Did you change your mind?
Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away
Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away
'Cause time is slipping away
Couldn't seem to change to suit you better
What a waste of time we were together
When I lost my place, I was left behind
Didn't fall from grace 'cause I changed my mind
Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do, I should give it up
Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away
Thanks to you, I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love

Stop wasting time 'cause time is slipping away

All that you want, and all that you need
Don't bother asking, just come to me
I know I'll see you, I'll see you again
Just keep on talking, listen when you can
Love reign down on me
Love reign down on me
Love reign down on me
Love reign down on me
Oh, Down On Me
It's something you find,yeah, you'll never lose
A feeling so fine now, just thinking of you
Take your time son, take it slow
Sooner or later, you'll get where you gotta go
Love reign down on me
Love reign down on me
Love reign down on me
Love reign down on me
Oh, Down On Me

I don't know why I don't see happiness in this town
Everyone I meet seems so ... they frown
What good's live in where dreams come true if nobody smiles?
Everyone's chasing latest star, the latest style
Take me to another space and time
You take me to a higher place so
I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you
I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this so wrong
That's the dream to sing the perfect girl the perfect song
All I know is I can keep on ...... the sky
When you're the only one that sees worth within my eyes
Take me to another space and time
You take me to a higher place so
I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you
You take me to another place
You take me to another place
You take me to a higher place
Take me another space and time
You take me to a higher place so
I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you
I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
Yeah, all I know is everything's nothing if I don't have you

oehoehoehoehoehoeh 2x
Took a while then I realized that nothing a boss now I'm drinking at home
And no one knows where we wanted to go old Tuesday night feel so slow but
I know that people say I'm lazy but I don't really care
Oh I can think of better things to do than to waste my time and go back to the zoo
I'm the hero of our time
Cause I'm the hero of our time
oehoehoehoehoehoeh I guess it should be battered
oehoehoehoehoehoeh then I'm the hero of our time!
Oh I'm a motorrunning I've been skinning bones
I've lost my pride of the seas I've known
I keep falling for the same mistakes
And I my best friends say "I told you so boy"
I know the time is moving faster if you don't really care
I ain't got money but I'm in my pride so I don't get bored tried to waste my time
I'm the hero of our time
Cause I'm the hero of our time
oehoehoehoehoehoeh I guess it should be battered

I lost my mind and now my heads a tent
And I spend the time wondering where it went
I want it back 'cause I got to live
This twist of fate I cannot forgive
I met a man not too long ago
And what he said to me I didn't want to know
I saw his bag and when he turned away
I reached inside, and then I lost my mind!
It's gone away, so far away
Yeah
I'm looking back, there's nothing left
In my head & I can't forget
I know it well, there's no way out
I lost, I lost, I lost my mind!
He's so unkind
It's gone, gone, gone away
It's gone, gone, gone away
Yeah I lost my mind

Haven't we both heard enough babe
This is what we're gonna do
Let me put my arms around you once more
There's nothing left here to prove
Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will
We ever learn to let it go
Break Through to the other side
I keep wondering when were you
Ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted
Something else in life
What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going
Right the troubles in your mind
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on
Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know
You better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side
What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing
What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all

I would wrap the world in clover
But to make me see my way
And I would die for you tomorrow
Would you come to me today?
Sing a song of sadness about the girl with the happy face
And dance upon the water with no ripple or a trace
Love is here (ain't) a cloud in the sky
Would you be my flushing bride?
I don't think so
But I never met a girl like,
I never met a girl like,
I never met a girl like you before
I'd climb the highest mountain
To the sunrise from your face
Light a million candles
To flicker to your name
Scream aloud with vengeance
With the wind beneath my breath
Do you understand the madness?
Do you recognize the grace?
Love is here (ain't a) cloud in the sky
Would you be my flushing bride?
I don't think so
But I never met a girl like
I never met a girl like
I never met a girl like
I never met a girl like you before,
Oh no I never met a girl like you before
Oh no I never met a girl like you before
I'd surely die (in limbo)
Waiting for your every call
Will I ever see your sunshine?
When I'm done playing it all (or any other thing at all??)
A boy with no companion
Lost for baby blue (must remain in blue??)
(Words have only meaning)
(When they come from one like you)
Love is here (ain't a) cloud in the sky
Would you be my flushing bride?
I don't think so
But I never met a girl like
I never met a girl like
I never met a girl like
I never met a girl like you before,
Oh I never met a girl like
Never met a girl like
Never met a girl like you before
Oh no I never met a girl like you before
Oh no I never met a girl like you before
Oh no I never met a girl like you before

You turned to me
And all at once
I knew I was betrayed
My eyes met yours just down the darkened path
Where both of us had strayed
Nothing good can come out of this
I know it may not be
But just then you turned to me
And I thought for a moment
Like the fool that I've become
I might be the one
To turn these lights back on
Just as I began to say
It's never worth the price you pay
I was going there anyway
You turned to me
And all at once
I knew that you had seen
How I was lost in something quite like love
When all I did was dream
Now as evening becomes the dawn
I wonder where you'll be
And just why you turned to me

Your bags out on the bed
Your closet's all cleared out
You say you're goin' to Jacksonville
Cause our love's all worn out
You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years
You might still look pretty
In that lacy little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess
I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
It's like a prime time movie
You play the part so well
You do believe you're Heaven sent
And livin' here is hell
I hear it's hot in Florida
And it's raining here tonight
But the sun's gonna shine tomorrow
And I'm gonna do alright
You might still look pretty
In that lacy little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess
I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh, and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
You might still look pretty
In that lacy little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess
I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
And darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave

In the morning, cold gray dawn
Shines through my window on my bedroom walls
Even in the light it's hard to see
Why no woman's sleeping next to me
Well, I best not lose myself
'Cause then I wouldn't have nobody else
To tell the things that a dreamer dreams
When he's down and life is being mean
Take a walk down Bleeker Street
(There's people down, it seems I'm not the only)
Trampled underneath the feet of lonely
If I wasn't such a comely man
It wouldn't be so hard to understand
Why every time I find someone
I wind up reeling from her smoking gun?
It gets hard to be myself
When I've got to keep my love on the shelf
'Cause even deserts need a little rain
To end the drought and wash away the pain
Take a walk down Bleeker Street
(There's people down, it seems I'm not the only)
Trampled underneath the feet of lonely
If I wasn't such a comely man
It wouldn't be so hard to understand
I've tried so hard but I can't see
Why no one waits at home for me
Spent time watchin' falling rain
Count the droplets on my window pane
Looking for a lover in the chilly wet
Rainy days are gone I haven't found her yet
I ain't hard to satisfy
No, I never been the kind to justify
If I deserve a little misery
Well, then I guess I'd better let it be
Take a walk down Bleeker Street
(There's people down, it seems I'm not the only)
Trampled underneath the feet of lonely
Well, if I wasn't such a comely man
It wouldn't be so hard to understand
I've tried so hard but I can't see
Why no one waits at home for me?

I can't stand to think about a heart so big it hurts like hell. Oh my God I gave my best but for three more years to end like this. Well do you want to fall apart? I can't stop if you can't start. Do you want to fall apart? I could if you can try to fix what I've undone. Cause I hate what I've become.
(Chorus) You know me, oh you think you do, you just don't seem to see. I've been waiting all this time to be something that I can't define. So let's cause a scene. Clap our hands and stomp our feet. Or something, yeah something. I've just gotta get myself over me.
I could stand to do without all the people I have left behind. What's the point in going around when its straight line baby. A straight line down. So let's make a list of who we need and it's not much if any thing. Lets make a list of who we need and well throw it away cause we don't need anyone, no we don't need anyone.
And I hate what I've become. You know the night life is just not for me, cause all you really need are a few good friends. I don't want to go out and be on my own, you know they started something I can't stand. You leave for the city, well count me out. Cause all this time is wasted on everything I've done.

Well, it's been said
That she's got a certain fascination.
But she's a one-way ticket
To a final destination.
She's comin' out to get you
With a love that will tear you apart.
She's comin' out to get you.
Well, you better watch out.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
Well you can find yourself with her
In a sticky situation.
But she'd stab you in the back
Without a moment's hesitation.
She's comin' out to get you
With a fear that will grip you inside.
She's comin' out to get you.
She could drive you to suicide.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's comin' out to get you
With a love that will tear you apart.
She's comin' out to get you.
Well, you better watch out.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
She's got the devil in her heart.
Ah.

Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy.
Wounded in the line of duty,
Parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties,
Urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles.
Leave it all and like a man,
Come back to nothing special,
Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,
Silver bullet suicides,
And messianic ocean tides,
And racial roller-coaster rides
And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry.
I know you need your sleep now,
I know your life's been hard.
But many men are falling,
Where you promised to stand guard.
I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor.
But then I overheard your prayer,
That you be this and nothing more
Than just some grateful faithful woman's favorite singing millionaire,
The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair,
Working for the Yankee Dollar.
I know you need your sleep now
Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are,
And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child.
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come
Till every taste is on the tongue,
Till love is pierced and love is hung,
And every kind of freedom done, then oh,
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love,
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love.

I can't stop killing songs you like
You look at me with eyes
Beat the sunrise in a contest, no question
Well, talk to all the others
And bring me back to earth
I'm thankful for your mother for what it's worth
Oh, all the memories we had
Framed in our minds like photographs
Take a second, take a second and make this last
Here where the future meets the past
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again
I can't stop moving 'cause I'll feel dead
Give me a second
And I'll turn into a year that you won't forget
We'll make them read our stories
And we'll make them eat their words
We'll make their lives seem boring for what it's worth
Oh, all the memories we had
Framed in our minds like photographs
Take a second, take a second and make this last
Here where the future meets the past
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again
I'll drink your poison and say
I'm still not going away
I'll swallow all your bombs and grenades
And love you like a tsunami wave
Wave, wave
Oh, all the memories we had
Framed in our minds like photographs
Take a second, take a second and make this last
Here where the future meets the past
And I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again
Oh, all the memories
Framed in our minds
Take a second, take a second and make this last
Here for a while
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again
Oh, all the memories
Framed in our minds
Take a second, take a second and make this last
Here for a while
I can never fall in love again
I can never fall in love again
Again

In the front of the line
Now I'm back at home
I want to live my life
In a bathtub
Roll a dirty dice
And you're playin' blood
Stole a maxipad
Because I abandoned love
It reminds me of salty candy
Semen shanties
Sailboats grindin'
Up against your back
I don't need no sentimental
Penis stencil
Feelings rising
Opposites attract
She made me feel so small
I had no say at all
She looked so cute they say
But I don't know her that way
Heaven hold me back
Got 20 lives
Got my jesus jammies
Need some exercise
Take a walk at night
Past the dating bar
I want to live my life
Like a trackstar
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na
Na, na na na na na Na, na na na na na

Oh, girl on my mind
Please come back to me
I love you with all my heart
With you I want to be
I want you to be near me
Is that too much to ask
Whoa, girl on my mind
Please say you will be mine
You're the one and the only
You are mine to have and to love
No one could ask for more
You're mine to adore
Girl on my mind
Please say you will be mine

[Chorus]
I used to know that the world was round
I relied on the speed of sound
Gravity used to hold me down
But now, what can I believe in?
You were the constant one true thing
You made me sure of everything
I can't believe this is happening
You and your brand new beau ( I think it's time to go)
I was under the distinct impression
That we were swinging in the same direction
But you've got a predilection
This truth is stranger than fiction
The way you touched me, I had no suspicions
But evidently, you've no inhibitions
Your body took you on a covert mission
Why am I the last to know?
[Chorus]
I walked in it was just around midnight
It was snowing, so they canceled my flight
Two empty glasses in the dim candlelight
I heard you mention my name
And then I heard another voice that shocked me
He was saying "is the front door locked?"
He saw my face and you tried to block me
My life won't every be the same
[Chorus]
You could have offered me some dignity
And not pulled the rug out from under me
I thought I was your queen
I thought I was your queen
[Chorus: x2]

When I was in my mothers womb
Social structure seemed a simple thing
After birth I cursed my luck
Then went down to breakfast
What I know fills me up
It is an everlasting cup
What I believe will never change
My consolation for the night
Mother had for me an egg
I understood the relations of production
She always provided for me
That's where I lost my naivety ?
Stability is in my mind
I associate with my kind
Charity, it fills my heart
To help the poor in Africa
[Chorus: x6]
Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world

Early warning
Stranger on the radar
Ripple in the wavelength
Leave it in the hands of fate
Nobody noticed the difference in the readout
The sadness in the answer
A twist in the logic
P.E.R.S.O.N.A.L.I.T.Y.
P.E.R.S.O.N.A.L.I.T.Y.
Low-key discussions
Rumble round the test-bed
Egg-heads in a huddle
A softening of the solid-state
Static alphabet
Rigid stabbing monotone
There's positive or negative
But no inbetween
Are you blind?
Are you looking through a broken pair of eyes
Are you ill-equipped to hear me?
Random brainwave
Groping for receivers
Are you deaf?
Are you one of the cogs
Too busy probing the pleasure centres of dogs
To get near me
Nobody noticed
The difference in the readout
The sadness in the answer
A twist in the logic

Don't believe anyone.
Don't read your mail.
Make light of every word you hear.
Turn off your radio. quit your job.
Do something different. disappear.
Do something different. disappear.
Think like a child. laugh at cocaine.
Never ever ever do what's proper again.
Understand everyone crystal-clear.
Rid yourself of fashion. disappear.
Remove yourself from fashion. disappear.
Reverse your morality. listen to bands
That play only music you can't stand.
Forget how to worry. enjoy your fears.
Stop your life insurance and disappear.
Stop your life insurance and disappear.

Take away the moment
That began the lonely night
Take it away
And you'll be back in my life
'Cause I need you back in my life
Take me back to the time
When I could live in your light
If that's the only way to live in your love
Take me back
If that's the way for me to live in your love
Take me back
If I must cling to someone
Then you must be the someone
On my own, on my way
Lookin' back to the day
Back to the day when I could live in your love
Take me back
I got to find a way to live in your love
Take me back

The body's not secure,
The truth will not absorb,
And this crumbling apart,
Is no good for you at all..
Sound, there's order in the sound,
The sound that you don't know..
And with eyes that never look,
Past the time under foot,
And this reading in the cards,
Is a caution to the birds..
Sound, there's order in the sound,
The sound that you don't know..

Don't ever think you're the first one who did it
Dos Bros, Dos Bros did it
And you wouldn't believe you're add the new
Dos Bros, Dos Bros knew it
They came, they saw, they took, they shook
No one can stop them go, go
Don't ever think so
From the outside they're handsome devils
From the inside they're true burn rebels
Woh, woh
Got a cross vanguard let's go Dos Bros
Woh, woh
Let the freak flag flag Dos Bros vamonos
Hey give up do commo do loquo
Viva Dos Bros I need your vachaleo
Hey give up do wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos
Don't ever make Dos Bros your enemy
They're unbeatable, they're uncheatable
And if help breaks loose you will understand
It's here to have friends in a rock band
They rule, you drewl, they rock until you're drown
No one can stop them, blow blow
Don't ever think so
From the outside they're pure gold getters
From the inside they're real jet setters
Woh, woh
Got a cross vanguard let's go Dos Bros
Woh, woh
Let the freak flag flag Dos Bros vamonos
Hey give up do commo co latso
Viva Dos Bros I need your vachaleo
Hey give up do wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos
Let me ask you this shut up
I got a question be crazy
You better never ever mess with Dos Bros
Because you're messing with the loss Dos Bros
Don't ever think you're the first one who did it
Dos Bros, Dos Bros did it
And you wouldn't believe you're add the new
Dos Bros, Dos Bros knew it
They came, they saw, they took, they shook
No one can stop them go, go!
Don't ever think so
Woh, woh
Got a cross vanguard let's go Dos Bros
Woh, woh
Let the freak flag flag Dos Bros vamonos
Hey give up do commo do loquo
Viva Dos Bros I need your vachaleo
Hey give up do wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos

never did much to restore
my self-confidence
and you said i should have more
i was only kidding when i said
blind date
sitting in your car
you got angry and hit my arm
dashboard hugs from drunk boys
got angry and hit the dashboard
i didn't want to talk about it
you didn't want to hear about it
stare at the road i'm honored
there on the road my solemn word
stare at the road i'm honored
stay in my blood too long
i'm there on the road and honored
fear of the road my solemn word
it stayed in my blood your honor
too long
said you liked hugs from boys
but i never saw them
i never saw them
but i knew they were there

Mama said "Watch out son! Skinny top, heavy bottom!"
Oh I see it's easy to tell that girl is putting you through hell
Papa said "my turn, step outside, you gotta learn
women and girls will make your head turn!"
but Daddy I'm doing fine without her
Love is unkind (3x)
Couple comes up to me
they're in love it's plain to see
take a step back and start to laugh
you know love can never last
Love comes in then falls out
that's when you learn what's it about ... Love is unkind (3x)
I wanna talk about love I wanna talk about love
because all my life I've been told that love will keep you together,
love is all you need, and all you need is love
love is the answer
and I remember the time when my mama sat me down
and she looke me in the eye the little pea-bone with a smile
and her smile turned into a laugh and her laugh turned into a cackle
and you know what she said, you know what she said ?
Love is unkind (3x) /It don't like nobody/ it don't got no friends
Ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna prove my point tonight
I'm gonna tilt my head up to the sky
I'm gonna look at the good lord in the eye
and if the good lord wants to strike me down tonight
and I haven't found my true love if I haven't found her
if I haven't found my true love then baby....
if the good Lord wants to strike me down tonight
and I haven't found my true love
I'M GONNA DIE A HAPPY MAN !!!

The photographs don't lie
We can't be alone
We can't be
Dangerous and sublime
Don't try this at home
Don't try this
We used to be invisible
Unlike you I like movin'
I like movin'
Used to be invincible
Before you I liked movin'
I liked movin'
I get so nervous
Waitin' for a natural reaction and
I can't stop thinkin'
You've exposed ??
Leave me a nervous wreck
A nervous wreck
The longest ??
It keeps me afloat
It keeps me
New York City I know
Don't pick up the phone
Don't pick up
You used to be invincible
Unlike you I like movin'
I like movin'
Used to be invincible
Before you I liked movin'
I liked movin'
I get so nervous
Waitin' for a natural reaction and
I can't stop thinkin'
You've ??
Leave me a nervous wreck
Oh oh oh
I can't stop thinkin'
Oh oh oh
I can't stop thinkin' (I can't stop thinkin')
Oh oh oh
I can't stop thinkin' (I can't stop thinkin')
We need to be invincible
Unlike you I like movin'
I like movin'
Used to be invincible
Before you I liked movin'
I liked movin'
I get so nervous
Waitin' for a natural reaction and
I can't stop thinkin'
You've ??
Leave me a nervous wreck

I must have sneezed
On knees I freeze
I mean I just choked up
Somehow I slept
I dream, I mean
I dreamt of nothing
Able to breathe a sweet relief
Now that you're here for me
A northern degree
Dove into me
Now I'm recovering
[Chorus]
I only want you to see
My favorite part of me,
And not my ugly side...
Not my ugly side.
Hook up a C.B. Wave a way
For conversation flow.
I'm shoved in your cage, to wage this rage,
Don't let me go.
A kick and a scream is all that seems
to mean a log thus far.
I won't let you on my stage, my page,
You can't know, yet you have to know.
[Chorus]

I have been feeling below par
and I can not even find the green
I'm feeling under the weather
That is to say it's on top of
me. I don't feel good today
I can't help it anyway.
I can not help my emissions
even if maybe they're a social faux pas
gastromonical extradition's
I shouldn't have spent all my time in the bar.
Hakimashita, I've soiled myself again.
My stomachs subsiding it's about time
I'm thinking of returning to duty now
Hang on I'm sure that's such a
good idea I might return to the bowl,
I don't feel good today
I can't help it anyway
Hakimashita.
Langauge has never been much a
barrier when it applies to this
There's not many misunderstandings that
arise following a vomit kiss.

Cotton candy, two for a quarter
See if the fat man can guess your weight
A big stuffed tiger is what I bought her
And I'm going home 'cause it's late
Roller coasters make me dizzy
And cotton candy makes me sick
I wish I had some Bromo fizzy
Now that would do the trick
Everyone knows that the clowns aren't happy
And everyone knows that the people don't care
I wish I could laugh at the way that they're acting
But I'm so sick, I just don't dare to
High wire dancers kick and balance
White silk horses step in time
The tattooed man displays his talents
I'm not the talented kind
I always go to the circus on Sunday
And there I can laugh at the people I see
But when I leave home in the morning on Monday
Everybody laughs at me
I make other people nervous
I guess that's why they laugh at me
But to me my life is a three-ring circus
And I can see it for free
Have you seen my wife Elvira?
She can tame a lion, you know
Well, I once had a bushy mane
But that was so damn long ago
Tight-collared clowns in plastic buildings
Have happy families as their fate
Happy jobs and happy clubs
And happy people they hate
Everyone's juggling and everyone's acting
With smiles of grease paint three feet wide
Everyone's caught on a carousel pony
And one time around is a lifetime ride

Dead red eyes flickering half bright went on for ride (? )
In slick silk. they were on to my circumstantial slide,
Blow by blow chipped off shell and bone. tripped and talked around
It could not walk through the crowd of careful lies busting open wide.
Sensible fact or fable, watched us fall from your favor.
Since you knew too much about it dressed in wax you lit the town in
Candlelight, flickering half bright. well I held it in my hands and now it's
Gone gone gone.
Saw it with my own two eyes, just pass me by.
Took a walk through a town of half stoned clones (?)
Bound and gagging. joke by joke they spot erase you,
Heard their news but it did not phase you one little bit,
Not one little bit. so I meet you by the light of main street
Stranded ghosts where I've been waiting. kill it 50 times or more,
Before I'm through I'll kill it 50 times more, just to bring it back to life,
And bust it open wide again. well I held it in my hands and now it's
Gone gone gone.
Blinded by the neon in your dead red eyes.

You were born in a southern fall
it might of been Sunday but I can't recall
all the birthdays I must have missed
your first steps and your first kiss
I don't even know if you know my name
but you should hear the truth before it's too late
so I hope this finds you
on some highway
Cuz I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
forgive my indiscretion
it's the only way I know
a million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
so turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
I played for tips and I played for less
I played a pretty southern girl right out of her dress
she danced until the lights came on
but there's a reason she's here instead of being at home
she said the songs you sang made the whole room cry
and that night I told a young man's lie
when I said I would call her
and I said I'd write
Cuz I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
forgive my indiscretion
it's the only way I know
a million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
so turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I'm sorry for the promises that turned to lies
if I could turn back the hands of time
I'd take you back and try try try
to make you understand
that this is who I am
I met a devil in an old motel
it seems I ain't got much of a soul to sell
my glass is empty
my hands are blue
and the doctor gave me about a month or two
well I thought I would make it to you this year
so forgive me one last time my dear
and tell your mother
I won't be coming home
Cuz I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
forgive my indiscretion
it's the only way I know
a million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
so turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
turn the radio up when your heart breaks down

Hell yeah
Yeah Woh oh'.
Well I got up early this mornin'
And had a song come to my mind
Yes and the woman I had was grinnin'
Says I didn't have the time
Too many people
Keep hangin' on my back door
Yes and they're always askin' me
Can I have a little more
Aww you know what I got to say 'bout that
Ohh keep runnin' baby
All my dreams are sorrow
Sometimes they're hard to bear
Lawd when I think about tomorrow
Woh why should I care
Well I'm always into something
Yes you know that's right
Well everybody's always running
Time to take a free ride
And I feel like I'm
Like I'm flyin' high
(Flyin' high)
And I feel like I'm so
Lawd I'm so damn high
And it seems like that day
Just ain't ever gonna come
(Seems like I'm always on the run)
Well I never sing alone
And I love to be the star
And travellin' on the road
Has left it's battle scars
Well I feel my world is movin'
Lawd It's just around the bend
My song was born on the highway
And that's where it's gonna end
And I feel like I'm
Like I'm flyin' high
(Flyin' high)
And I feel like I'm so
Lawd I'm so damn high
And it seems like that day
Just ain't ever gonna come
(Seems like I'm always on the run)

Take my hand
Maybe we should run away
Maybe we should disappear
Leave everything behind
Like the useless things
Boxes labeled memories
The sudden health emergencies
Yeah we can leave those things behind
Show me,
Show me arms that reach for all we can be
Through understanding, tried forgiveness,
I faced the past,
It's what I witness
Why do I only feel the chills when I'm with you?
I only hear your words that you say are true
But you keep thinking it over, thinking it over
You could catch me if you wanted to
Why you gotta say good bye
When you know you could come with me....
"No!" Can't afford to leave and stay
(i cant' afford it)
We're gonna have to just build one way
(look , i cant afford it)
So tell me, tell me all the things
You told me we could be
Through understanding, tried forgiveness
I faced the facts,
It's what I witnessed
Why do I only feel the chills when I'm with you
I only hear your words that you say are true
But you keep thinking it over, thinking it over
catch me if you want
I only feel the chills when I'm with you
I feel it so high,
I feel it so high
Ca-Catch me, Ca-ca-catch me
"Why does the heart always have to break?"
(When you're trying way too hard)
"have to break?"
(Yeah she'll see right through you)
"have to break"
(All Communication, and the conversation, it breaks down)
"Now there'll be nothing to talk about"
Absolutely nothing just blah,blah,blah
Why do I only feel the chills when I'm with you?
I only hear the words that you say are true
But you keep thinking it over, thinking it over
You could catch me if you wanted to.
Catch me,
Ca-ca-catch me.

The spring is over, no more golden race
All the ease and the peace has suddenly faded away
I live a century filled with sorrow and sin
There's no rights, no wrong, such a godless state I'm in
Another live saint gonna take my place
You say a cheap prayer to my pretty face, yeah
You better pray for rain, yeah
Never too old to contain my rage
The silver age, the silver age
This is how I'm gonna spend my days
Gonna fight, gonna fuck, gonna feed
Gonna walk away
Stupid little kid wanna hate my game
I don't need a spot in your hall of fame, no
What a fucking game, yo
I'm wiping my face of the shit you say
In the silver age I walk away singing
The silver age is calling out a melody
Breaking me was hard to do
I had to break away from you
But since you found my switch
I've been falling on my face
And now it comes so clear
The love sigh I hear you sing
The silver age is calling out a melody

We'll hold this off to build these machines
Crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder
Just look out of your window and you'll find us here
We can make a stand to stop the uproars
If you can fight in wars for that
Crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder
If you could give us the answers now
Help us to end all the suffering
We'll clean the blood from all of our eyes
Take the rage away from us
If you could us the answers now
We could crush these empires to ashes and make them wonder
I hope that in time that I'm okay with all of this

crusty eyes and greasy grins
inhaling smoke from the valve gasket again
coffee 4am, drunk again by noon
shit stained couch through the midwest
blasting 80's tunes
ups and downs, vague smiles and frowns
in a van they last forever
complications take control
when you're not so clever
what matters now is floorspace
inside jokes and sleeveless t-shirt tans
cardgames I'll never understand
14 cents, cue ball in hand
laughing at all the latebreak bands
drugs are boring, the world's exploding
sometimes nothing's ever changing
I swore I'd never grow up
sick and slowly aging
what matters now is floorspace
one more city, another name
I can't quite put the face to
four digits to a club, we're 2 hours late to
one quick set with no soundcheck
but no here's nostalgic yet
I thought I had this life figured out
I'm dumber than the dumbest fuck
so full of complex feelings
and so shit out of luck
what matters now is floorspace

Is it just a passing phase?
Do your methods change each day
False are stating your reason claim
No one's listening what a shame
Oh, so never mind
Oh, so never mind
Oh, so never mind
Oh, so never mind
The big intention's fallen flat
So try to break your way out of that
Create an image so contrived
Nothing at your side ...
Oh, so never mind
Oh, so never mind
Oh, so never mind
Oh, so never mind
Never mind x 14
Is it just a passing phase?
Do your methods change each day
Forgiving nothing is being kind
You turn your back and you left us behind
oh so, never mind
oh so, never mind
oh so, never mind
oh so, never mind

Day is dawning
Almost sounded like a warning
Wind was rushing through the trees almost falling
I never thought that I'd become
The proud father of my three sons
Years of fragment
Between the shame and the sentiment
For all the years that I might have been absent
I can't do what can't be undone
Oh no, my three songs
I love you more than I can say
What I give to one, the other cannot take away
I bless the day you came to be
With everything that is left to me
Here's your pillow
Go to sleep and I will follow
May you never have anymore sorrows
That's not something that you can count upon
Still I want it for my three sons
My, my, my three sons
Deep in the night I turn cold and sick
But I only curse arithmetic
I bless the day that you came to be
With everything that is left to me

Clothes aren't what they used to be
They don't seem to fit you and me, anymore
Modesty is out the door
Flaunting what we've got and more is in
Yeah, it's in
They're sayin'
"Don't ask why, just wear what we say
You'll look like a model if you'll only obey
To get the attention, just do what we say"
Pay so much for clothes so small
Was this shirt made for me or my doll?
Is this all I get?
I looked so hot but caught a cold
I was doing just what I was told
To fit in
Clothes aren't what they used to be
They don't seem to fit you and me, anymore
Modesty is out the door
Flaunting what we've got and more is in
Yeah, it's in
We're sayin'
"Let's ask why, don't wear what they say
Don't want to be a model; they can't eat anyway
That kind of attention will fade with the day
So, I'll stand up and say
Clothes that fit are fine
Won't show what's mine
Don't change my mind
I'll be fine

She's out of sync
And everyone around her
Knows that something is wrong
She's out of sync
She's got all the symptoms
Of a girl who skipped a beat
She's out of sync
A piece of ancient history
She's a walking mirage
She's out of sync
She entered through the exit
And never stopped to think
She's out of sync she's a half
Step behind
She's out of luck her body split from
Her mind
She's out of orbit she'll never connect
She'll run out of time before she
Accepts she's out of sync
She's out of sync (sync)
She's out of sync (sync)
She's out of sync
Everybody senses
There s a distance to keep
She's out of sync
And totally committed
To living in a dark age
She's out of sync
Constantly undoing
What's already been done
She's out of sync
Trapped in a silent movie
And she's on the brink
She's out of focus
She's a warp in time
She's discontinued
A break in the line

Inside a rolling stone
I look for you
Inside a stolen thief
I listen closely
Murdered by yourself
No one else
Like a fake eyelash I lie to myself
A moon is shining high above your way home
A vampire on your mind drinking the water
That falls from your eyes and your heart
When will she notice me and no one else

Let's keep the curtains closed today
And hope that everyone will stay away
This is our first day for quite a while
Let's keep it just for you and me
I hope that there's no sadness in your heart
Could this be just the start of coming home
Alone again we'll find if we were near
Or was it just the fear of being alone
So I won't promise, weep, or lie to you
The answers hide in what we do
Just wish you well and hope that you don't cry
And never, never say goodbye
There's just one thing
I ask of you
There's just one thing
I ask you not to do
Never, never say goodbye
Never, never say goodbye

I'm fixing a drink in the morning
With a wavy tongue
You may have stayed too long
You're splitting apart at the seams
From the hospital call
You've known him so long
If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you got something to fall back on
Deep in the heart of the country
Was a house I built from logs
A raven and a lady hawk
Quiet and calm through the day
See the sun burn through the fog
Approaching was a yellow dog
If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you got something to fall back on
And what are people really for?
Does any body even care?
I'll bet you get a lot of compliments down there
If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you got something to fall back on
And do you got something to say?
Isn't something coming over you?
Do you got important things still left to do?

I may seem wise I may seem old
Feels like I just came into this world
I beg and lie and then regret,
I run and grab and soon forget
I can feel I see two skies above
One to be with, one - to love
I envy them. They never lose,
'Cause they have a choice not to choose
I can feel I see two skies above
Clouds and clouds and clouds are passing by
Watch the clouds, while they cross the sky
If I should choose among them all
I'd be confused, I'd feel small
Clouds and clouds and clouds are passing by
I may seem wise I may seem old
Feels like I just came into this world
I beg and lie and then regret,
I run and grab and soon forget

I harmonize with a million screaming laughs
That haunted those before us
Preaching symphonies while the chorus yelled, "Unity"
It's based on facts, it's based on facts
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay
Will you watch your step?
The boring story's left
"You're feeling lost in here," she said
Come in here, the pain won't last
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay
Take this weight off my shoulders
And move it to my brain
Take this weight off my shoulders
And move it to my brain
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then packaged it away
You spitshined my corroded halo
Then left it to decay

I'm glad I'm alive am I
I'm glad I'm alive
I'm glad I'm alive
I'm glad I'm alive am I

Hello honey, how is every little thing?
Sure I'll be glad to meet you at the beach at ten
I wanna be your brown-eyed handsome man
Plant my feet in the sand
Maybe you could be the Sunkist queen
In your cool Raybans
Ooohweee, you and me babe
Here comes another summer of love
And we're a fine pair of coconuts
Oil me up, buttercup
Park your towel over here
With your things n' stuff
I'm gonna work on my major tan
I'm gonna get it perfect yet
You go ahead, hon, and jump in the lake
Let me know if it's wet
Ooohweee, you and me babe
Here comes another summer of love
And we're a fine pair
Under the sun
Where there's only one plan
Build a condo in the sand
And maybe we'll be fried again, oh man
Oil me up now coconut
I just love to feel your hands
Oil me up now coconut
I wanna be your man
Ooohweee, you and me babe
Here comes another summer of love
And we're fine coconuts

Never did I find a nest for my soul
We have made all the bans we imposed
We have thrown
On ourselves
In memory's manner
The weakened will
Raise their heads
To mellow their somber faces
This day you will
Be in your camp
In the streets of your people
You are at
The summit of the honored
Decorate yourselves
Decorate yourselves
Decorate yourselves
Crazy man, stand to attach
No friends listening
Crazy man, stand to attach
No friends listening
All I ever
Wanted was to
All I ever
Wanted was to
All I ever
Wanted was to see your face
And contemplate

Wanted was to see your face
And contemplate
Never did I find a nest for my soul

"Well let me heip you in here so you can rest by my fire...
so strong cold out here."
"Thank ya. It has been a cold winter, hasn't it."
"Yip."
"Hah... There was ice this morning early when I left the house. I seen it on the ditches as I passed."
"Yip"
"I said to myself; Jack Frost has been here."
"He sure has... Can you make it?"
"Yes sir, I can make it."

Were the ones
with the runaway eyes
Were the ones
who can improvise
is there doom
in the hard situation?
We believe in
positive stipulations

Log on.
We are the young
with the modern attitude
breaking down the walls
breaking all the rules
Tomorrow comes
and we might go away
so we dont worry
bout the price we pay
We are the young
oh!
we are the young

Every street
is an arcade of dreams
I go on downtown
exploding at the seams
with lights and sounds
and a soul parade
light and blue color
promenade

We are the young
with the modern attitude
breaking down the walls
breaking all the rules
Tomorrow comes
and we might go away
so we dont worry
bout the price we pay

Another way to gain control
a brand new day to rock and roll

Another way to gain control

breaking down the walls
breaking all the rules
Tomorrow comes
and we might go away

bout the price we pay

We are the young

When I leave
I wanna wait for the silence
You gave me all you've got
But now I stand here waving to you
But still you smile
You're still looking back
Maybe I just wasn't kind enough
I'm fighting urges to fall again
Yet I stumble, Yet I stumble
These roses died, three days since
Black roses died, we said goodbye
These roses died, three days since
I'm sorry, I miss you
How do I remain complete?
When all we bled is lost
We could've burned the earth and sky
A second chance, the seconds spent
Each other's shadow, should have known
I'm fighting urges to fall again
Yet I stumble, Yet I stumble
These roses died, three days since
Black roses died, we said goodbye
These roses died, three days since
I'm sorry, I miss you
These roses died, three days since
Black roses died, we said goodbye
These roses died, three days since
I'm sorry, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
Hear this, I'm yours
I'm at your feet
Hear this, I'm yours
I'm at your feet
(inside this heart you still remain
But faded letters are erased)
Hear this, I'm yours
I'm at your feet
(inside this heart you still remain
But faded letters are erased)
These roses died, three days since
Black roses died, we said goodbye
These roses died, three days since
I'm sorry, I miss you
These roses died, three days since
Black roses died, we said goodbye
These roses died, three days since
I'm sorry, I miss you
These roses died, three days since
These roses died ,three days since

Maybe on the street
Maybe on the beach
Maybe I'll see you at the mall
Jesus was right
Yeah, I don't want to fight at all
I want to be alone
I want to be inside my headphones
I skate for transportation
Play guitar for elevation
Into a state of my own
I like distortion when I bar-chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board
Maybe on the beach
Maybe on the street
Maybe I'll see you in the hall
I want to be alone
I want to be inside my headphones
I skate for transportation
Play guitar for elevation
Into a state of my own
I like distortion when I bar-chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board.

Ah hear my mother call
I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough
I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ah)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, "Father, father it's for the kids (Ah)
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong"
Then the devil sang
"Would you like to dance with me? We're doin' the cosmic slop"
She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!
Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She says, "Father, father it's for the kids
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord!
(Ah)
Hear my mother call
(Ah)
Hear my mother call
She says, "Father, father it's for the kids
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Hear my mother call
Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Hey!
I can hear my mother call (ooh-ah-ooh)
Mother, mother
Late at night
Calling me
Mother
I can hear my
I can hear my mother calling me
Late at night I hear my mother
Hey!

Take me far away
And make me lose control
For now I need to pray
Think of forgotten souls
Disappear from every sphere
Watch them high
Then slowly die
Then slowly die
If you shut your eyes
You'll float through the blackest hole
So sure in night time sky
You see forgotten souls
Disappear from every sphere
Watch them high
Then slowly die
Then slowly die

Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP
Back in the schoolyard life wasn't so hard, but I couldn't wait to leave.
I left school at sixteen, tired of the routine, money is what I need.
I got into the job line, but there's no work for my kind,
No school tie and no degree, no chance for me.
I found some employment, but still no enjoyment, I worked in a factory.
I picked up my wages, fhe first time in ages, it don't seem enough to me.
The years go by in slow time, became a man in no time,
You came along, the time was right - turned on the light.
Gonna love my life away, I wish I could, (I wish I could)
Girl, you're leadin' me astray, I've been misunderstood (been misunderstood)
Oh oh, I'm in my second childhood, oh oh.
Back on the breadline, seemed like a long time, the waiting was all in vain.
I spent my vacation down at the station, waving to all the trains.
After this deep depression, I shoulda' learned my lesson
I found you in the nick of time, who'll buy the wine?
Gonna love my life away, I wish I could, (I wish I could)
Girl, you're leadin' me astray, I've been misunderstood (been misunderstood)
Oh oh, I'm in my second childhood, oh oh.
{Erik - Slide Solo}
It's hard to act my age now, I'm going through that stage now.
You make me feel good - you make me feel good.
Now I don't feel so grown up, 'cause everytime you phone up,
You make me feel good - you make me feel good.
(conversation)
{Instrumental}
Gonna love my life away, I wish I could, (I wish I could)
Girl, you're leadin' me astray, I've been misunderstood (been misunderstood)
Oh oh, I'm in my second childhood, Oh oh, I'm in my second childhood,
Yea-ee-ya,
I'm in my second childhood, whoa oh.

I don't wanna hear another plastic love song
And I don't need no more triviality
Cause I know there is more
That love could be
But you know that's not to say that I know just what I want out of
life
It doesn't mean that I feel hopeful everyday I'm alive
But when you smiled at me I felt many things
Like lust and fear and dreams
And though it could hurt I've gotta try it anyway
When the door is flung wide open you don't stay inside your room all
day
You go where there's a chance of losing the awful empty lie
That it's better not to need anyone than to take the crazy uncertain
ride
And it's a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain
But at the best price you can
I don't know much more than your first name
But I might stick around till I know everything
Because who we could be remains to be seen
Is it the joke now or the dream
And I like the new beginning the slow show and tell
Sometimes I think the expectation is sweeter than the love itself
It's alright I'm gonna take my time I'm gonna take your mistery
You know it's simple don't you try to ignore take your freedom when
you're given the key
Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain
But at the best price you can
Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain
Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain

Hope unknown, sometimes just waking is surreal
I walk right through the nameless ones, I know that hope's unknown
Sometimes the water feels so real
As I walk through, it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning
This day never seems to end, this pain, never
This day never seems to end, this rage I can not let go
I hear them calling, I feel them gnawing out holes
All through out our flawless souls, so alone
Sometimes I swear that I can hear
The taunting of the voiceless ones
I fear that I alone fear those who finally ceased to feel
That they're alone inside this place, I am the misplaced
I hear them calling, I feel them gnawing out holes
All through out our flawless souls
Now every face, it looks familiar, then every face would melt away until
Now everyone, do you know I know your deception?

Who's gonna do what Simon say?
I'm gonna do what Simon says
I'm gonna do what Simon says
I'm gonna do what Simon says
Of course we should what Simon says
I'm gonna do what Simon says
I'm gonna do what Simon says
I'm gonna do what Simon says
Of course I'ma do what Simon says

SHADOW DREAM SONG
WITH GREG ALLMAN
I meant to call her name
I meant to take her hand
I meant to be the same and understand
Just what was happening
In the evening
Between the princess and the prince
Oh yeah
I can't be bothered now
Cannot eat or drink
I can't remember how I used to think
What was that song she sang
In the morning
About the princess and the prince
Yeah, yeah
It's a crystal ringing way
She has about her in the day
She s a laughing dapple shadow
Yes, she's a laughing dapple shadow
In my mind
Mmm hmmmmm yeah
If I could hear her voice
If I could see her face
If I could wish and be most any place
Be where I saw her last
On that evening past
With the princess and the prince
Yeah
The princess and the prince

The iron hand it ain't no match for the iron rod
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
It is only He who can reduce me to tears
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn
Like a thief in the night, he'll replace wrong with right
When he returns.
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that is passes through
He unreleased His power at an unknown hour that no one knew
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice ?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness ?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride ?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease
Until He returns ?
Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask
How long can you falsely and deny what is real ?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal ?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned
He's got plans of his own to set up His throne
When He return.

Once there was this kid who
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed him so hard
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
But both the girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that
'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Oh oh
Oh oh

Two days have passed.
And all I want is to feel better.
They won't be back.
And a long weekend is coming up.
I left the house.
It was just to see you for an hour.
Hoping for two.
I was short of breath,
As I passed the doorman for a second time.
And it rained all day.
I don't have a raincoat of my own.
I then arrived.
Ten minutes early with no smokes.
And I was broke.
Without a smoke.
All of the time.
I thought I was crazy cause you told me so.
It was profound.
Yet the piano I was humbled by.
I touch what you've touched.
But all I remember was your nose.
And I suppose,
All eyes are closed.
Two days have passed.
And all I want is gone for good this time.

Thought I was lookin' good
So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood
Was invited by a skinny girl
Into her high class world
Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose
My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point
[Chorus x2]
I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here
I'll have me a real good time
Dancing madly round the room, yeah
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune
Was escorted by a friendly slag
'round the bedroom and back
Wandered across to the door
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead.
[Chorus]
The skinny girl made it clear
That she only came here for the beer
The vicar simply reeked of gin
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle
(good party)
I was glad to come, but I was also glad to get home

The diamond that was stolen held the code that melted
Water into letters spelling, where it had been taken to
In fact, I had a vision of the numbers
Corresponding with the letters, T H E D I A M O N D
They're suspended like a prism splitting floodlight
To poles of primary colors clawing the veil of the vacuum
There's a picture of this given to authorities, the sentence
"I'm an architect and here's my prison" written on it
With schematics so meticulous the measurements
Of super-impositions of a room within the window
Make a dream that ends up being such an entity in your
Reflection, you are the dream to it, you are the prism
The mirrors in the corner throwing images
Against the other mirrors made counting corners impossible
The breaking news had counted one, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven corners of the mirrored corners
Why have you done? What you have done something
Is so sinister when staring at the diamond something
You have done sinister why have you done this am I in the mirror?
Am I what you have been staring at, am I a diamond?
Just like a reflection of a friend of mine
I am a reflection of an enemy, am I a reflection of an enemy
Just like a reflection of a friend of mine?

Convict pool, in the land of salvation
Is where you find this masterpiece
Of a right-wing kidney punch
Escape, convict pool, escape
Executions are nearly flawless
So riding forever in the deep
Or taking it into the shallow
Is not a problem
Escape, convict pool, escape
Convict pool, escape
Check the underwriter killers
For video surveillance of the convict pool
In the warden son's private collection
Escape, convict pool, escape
Social fool, we evade
I forget to mention
That the coping of this baby's like butter
So stand up and grind far
Escape, convict pool, escape
Parental fools, we evade
Tony and George, avoid the nipple
Protrusion on the wall
With a backside hurricane
Over the death box, we fall
And escape, convict pool
Escape, social tool
Evade, courtroom duel
Escape

If I want to walk home with you
Hearing every word, thinking it's true
In a barren field for us to cut through
On our victory lap cross an old street cat
That turns to stop and see you
A small stone somewhere in your shoe
All day long
All day long
Long
The old folks wake up for the day
Seeing the monsters have lingered from the past
And a great bird is flying away
From our family tree something wrong with me
I've got a secret or two
Hiding somewhere but
It won't take long
No it won't take long
Long

Jangling Jack

Visits the home of the brave
Hails a fat yellow cab

I wanna little umbrella too
Jack flops on his stool
Sees the grinning man laugh
So Jack laughs back
Jack raises his glass
Says, God bless this country
And everything in it
The losers and the winners
The good guys and the sinners
The grinning man says, Buddy
It's all Yackety Yack
Whips out a little black pistol
Shoots a bullet in Jack
Jangling Jack
Do Da Do Do Da Do
Jangling Jack
How do you Do Da Do
Jangling Jack Flies off his seat
Crashes through the door
Lands in a heap on the street
Hears his mother's voice
Going, Do do do
Jack is shouting
Mummy is that you?
He sees the berserk city
Sees the dead stacked in piles
Sees the screaming crowd
Screams, Where am I?
Going Do da do Going Do da do
Well Jangling Jack
As a matter of fact
Crawls through the crowd
Back into the bar
Jack crawls to his stool
Jack drags himself up
Falls back down on his arse
In a puddle of blood
Going Goodbye Mummy
Goodbye Goodbye
Jack doubles over
And he vomits and dies
Going Do do do Going Do do do

A blackout they peel him off of the floor(frenetic amnesic) he's delirious he thinks hes been here before (frenetic amnesic)no recall not one familiar face (frenetic amnesic)the molded man has been completely erased (frenetic amnesic)
[chorus:]
Everybody's after me, you could be the enemy, you seem too happy to reveal yourself there's no resentment here (frenetic amnesic)
Completely in the dark try to pave a way with no chance (frenetic amnesic)and no reason not knowing who you are looking for the truth it aint (frenetic amnesic) there and you cant believe them

What you see is what you get (you get) 2 seconds later i forget (forget)You seem too happy to reveal yourself theres no resentment here

Have you got a fine place to slip to
When you're feeling down
Have you had a week or two
Just to get your troubles down
Found a lot of life and laughter
With a grandfather in the bowery
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen
She had a mind of forty
I met her on a cold day
In a city far away
With the worlds about zero
And i saw at once,
Into her soul
She's gonna call me her hero
Never like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
With the grandfather in the bowery
'Cause i like her like the world

I sit reflecting
I feel the end has begun
It seems my days now mirror the setting sun
So many places that I have been
This ride that was long seems so short in terms of now and then
For All that has been
And All that is
All that's to be
Lord, I'm just killing time
And time's killing me
Dead man breathing, just taking up space
Calloused and weathered like the lines on one's face
Dead man breathing, my conscience is bare
The lining of my soul is torn yet I no longer care
For All that has been
And All that is
All that's to be
Lord, I'm just killing time
And time's killing me

This is a song I made for you
This is a song I sing for you
This is a song for punx and Skins
This is a song to make you sing
A WAY OF LIFE x4
This is a song for the Funeral crew
This is a song for the Hardcore Youth
This is a song to stand proud and strong
This is a song to singalong
A WAY OF LIFE x4
This is a song for the drinking boys
This is a song oi oi oi
This is a song you sing in the pub
this is a song drink pogo and fuck
A WAY OF LIFE x4

See this ancient riverbed
See where all our follies are led
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
I was just some towhead teen
Feeling 'round for fingers to get in between
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
Sweet descend this rabble round
The pretty little patter of a seaport town
Rolling down the water and rolling down the old main drag
All dolled up in gabardine
The lash-flashing Leda of Pier nineteen
Queen of the water and queen of the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
Down by the water and down by the old main drag

You're either dipping your toe, or you're drowning.
You're either dipping your toe, or you're drowning.
Is it better never to start than to
End the pain of having to start
Of having to start
Halfway to the bottom
It's to be forgotten
I never thought it would come so easy
I never thought it would go so quickly
Is it never never to love than to
Risk your heart having to lose?
Having to lose.
Halfway to the bottom
It's to be forgotten
Halfway to the bottom
It's to be forgotten
I don't know which to grow.
Is it wiser never to speak than to
Risk your voice and never be heard?
Never be heard.
Never be heard.

pulverized

when they've got you beat before you start
when it seems you're all alone
you've got nowhere to go
beaten down again

and fly

now fly the flag

This way to the methylated spirit
Such a thing that you ain't get with it
This way to the trippin' easy
Toke comes out break, keep it breezy
And you know the long term plan
Is to stay there for as long as you can
You know the shortest route
Twin carbs between your leather boots
So, this way to the trippin' easy
This way to the trippin' easy

Old John Robertson
He wore a Stetson hat
People everywhere would
Laugh behind his back
No one cared to take
Any time to find out
What he was all about
Fear kept them out
Children laughed and played
And didn't know his name
They could tell when he
Was coming just the same
Walking slow with old John's
Crippled wife by his side
Then she sighed, then she died
Magic words from him
Entrancing children's ears
But they laughed at him
When he went to hide his tears
All in vain was no game
For he'd lost an old friend
In the end, in the end
Old John Robertson
He wore a Stetson hat
People everywhere would
Laugh behind his back
No one cared to take
Any time to find out
What he was all about
Fear kept them out

What do you think they would say
If I stood up and I walked away
Nobody here really understand me
And so I'll wave goodbye I'm fine
Tones of home said
You don't know the way I'm living
You don't like me
Tones of home, tones of home
And so I'll wave goodbye.
I'm flyin' I'm flyin' home
And I always thought this would be
The land of milk and honey
Oh but I came to find out
That it's all hate and money
And there's a canopy of greed holding me down.
See I'm so high to you, so I'll fade away
I said your on your own
Your mom and daddy said,
That your sister said, and your brothers saying
Everybody is saying
Everybody, is saying I, eye God I gotta go!!

My blessed son, you...
You've got a lot to learn.
So I'm your best friend,
You love me, and
Well I'll tell you something:
"We're on the road to messy."
Now the bees behind my eyes sing "beware,"
But my bee-stung tongue wants in there.
Beware, beware, beware of me.
If your heart is not on my side,
if your heart is not on my side,
if your heart is not on my side,
You're not on my side anymore.
I steal a piece of your diary.
I don't think that looks like me.
Am I so cold, now that I'm older?
I tell you stories,
That doesn't mean you know me.
Now the bees behind my eyes sing, "beware,"
But my bee-stung tongue wants in there.
So come at me with mouth open wide,
And I, like a jerk, I crawl inside.
Beware, beware, beware of me.
If your heart is not on my side,
If your heart is not on my side,
If your heart is not on my side, you're not on my side anymore.

Gone away, gone away forever
Not to come back home
I did stay all the night through with you
Without knowing you, gone
Without time for the world to breathe on
The changing dust it woke
Glimpses of all the life you poured out
Till the vessel broke
Don't know if I'll see you
When it's my turn to come home
Don't know if I'll see you
But I hope so, but I hope so
Parting now at our own Grey Havens
The words you left the debris
So be still, knowing that
He'll see you across the sea
Don't know if I'll see you
When it's my turn to come home
Don't know if I'll see you
But I hope so, but I hope so
To be woken from the long sleep
Of this world's night
Don't know if I'll see you
When it's my turn to come home
Don't know if I'll see you
But I hope so, but I hope so
Don't know if I'll see you
Don't know if I'll see you

When the everywhere-eye
Asks you
Who is the emperor
Of the sky
Take the Archangel's Thunderbird
Go to Edgar Allen
In the tower of sleep
He'll tell you a story
Which makes you to creep
The echo of your cries
Is falling so deep
Rent a destroyer
And sail to Cape Cod
There lives a lion
They call him God
There is no elevator to Eden
But a hole in the sky
In shock-corridors
People are standing
With their eyes in their hands
But they don't understand
Why their confessional folding-chairs
Go into the narcotic flight of stairs

The feelings linger on
The clors flashing
The way we've been let down
Was like a wave crashing
Thrown against the shore
In a foreign country
With all my memories
Scattered in the storm
Blown away
Blown away
Washed away so many
Glory days
And all we have is now
All we have is now
So let the tears we've cried
Be the doorway
So we may carry on
Float away
Float away
Break the fever dream
Of yesterday
'Cause all we have is now
All we have is now
So let these tears we've cried

WE ARE THE ENEMIES - OF THIS SOCIETY
To the deprived
And the neglected
To the unwanted
And all the ones discarded in this world
SOCIAL OUTCAST - SOCIAL OUTCAST
WE ARE THE ENEMIES - OF THIS SOCIETY
No matter what's needed
Or how great the hurry
As long as there's rebels
You don't need to worry, we're standing beside you

[Chorus:]
Lately I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you
Lately I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way
I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
[Chorus]
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
When love comes over you

You've got a sad face
You don't show it
And you're smiling it, too
Even in deep, deep outer space
There's something for you
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
The world is a rock that's spinning so fast
It'll give you jim-jams
I'm just a real love diplomat
Won't give you no flim-flams
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
How many stars girl
Can you both count
And then classify?
I'm standing here in this big swirl
Singing this lullaby
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby

He's on the level if he's inclined
The son of a devil, he wants mine and more
Ooh, he's a high, high climber, not just a clinging vine
He made the grade, he made his marks, senor
And guess who's keeping score?
Rush rush, got the yeyo? Buzz buzz, gimme yeyo
Rush rush, got the yeyo? Uh, oh
Yo yo, no, no, yeyo, uh oh
He's a real speed demon, he's one of a kind
Watching, waiting, winking over his shoulder
He's running out of time
Rush rush to the yeyo, buzz buzz, gimme yeyo
Uh, oh, yo, yo, no, no, yeyo
Go, go, rush rush to the yeyo
Never, never take a chance
Before you know he's in a hurry
Better better make your mind up, boy
He's faster, he's faster, he's faster, he's faster
Rush, rush, gimme yeyo, buzz buzz buzz
Gimme yeyo, uh oh, no no, gimme yeyo
Yo yo, dame yeyo, uh, oh
Rush rush, gimme yeyo
Buzz buzz buzz, gimme yeyo
Uh, oh, no no, gimme yeyo
Yo yo, dame yeyo, uh oh
He's a real speed demon, he's one of a kind
Watching, waiting, winking over his shoulder
He's running out of time, time, time, time

Lock up your shed because Juanito's coming
Just crossed over into Mexico
Lock up your pigsties and your daughters
'Cause if it moves, you know old Juanito
Young ladies, he likes to ravish
He knows how to make them wet
And if he can't, he know he'll dig himself a hole
Or go looking for your favorite pet, ole
They call him Juanito the bandito
Lock up your things, you'll be robbed
They call him Juanito, the randy bandito
Oh, how many people have sobbed his name?
He wears a soft sun-soaked sombrero
A droopy mustache to his chin
He will hold up, stab or shoot you
So that he can get it in, okay
They call him Juanito the bandito
Lock up your things, you'll be robbed
They call him Juanito, the randy bandito
Oh, how many people have sobbed his name?
They call him Juanito the bandito
Lock up your things, you'll be robbed
They call him Juanito, the randy bandito
Oh, how many people have sobbed his name?
My son, I tell you, don't bother
I'm going downtown with the guys, okay?

Life is cruel, no choice but to play
We're up to our necks in yesterday
We all know that thief called life
Leaves us with grief at night
And I'm trying to tell you
You don't try
No one cares
And I'm dying to tell you
You don't listen
You don't care
I can tell you everything that you need to know
You've gotta face your past
See how long you can last
We will be remembered for everything that we did wrong
We will be forgotten for everything that we did right

This Better Be Good
By Fountains of Wayne
I saw you holding hands
With some guy wearing light blue Dockers pants
And I thought that I might just give you a chance to explain
What the hell is in your brain?
You know you pretend youre going to Seabright for the long weekend
but something dont seem right
And your best friend Renee keeps on saying she saw you at the Gap with somebody in a baseball cap and you know
This better be good
This better be good
Yeah, this better be good now baby
Cause you sure dont act like you should
This better be good, good
I thought you could be trusted but I guess you confess but youre totally busted
Cause I swear you were sharing a hot dog with mustard after work with that same old polyester shirt and you know
This better be good
This better be good
Yeah, this better be good now baby
Cause you sure dont act like you should
This better be good, good

I don't want to get back into the ring
But I feel like these gloves are glued to my knuckles
And every time, and every time I try to stand up for myself, yeah, yeah
I start to feel, I feel my knees start to buckle, buckle, yeah, YEAH!
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
And as I step, and as I step, and as I step, and as I step
And as I step, and as I step, step, step into the ring
I see my opponent, he is 10 feet tall and 500 pounds
Yeah, this is getting kind of frightening
And as we knock gloves, and as we knock gloves
And as we knock gloves, and as we knock gloves
He said don't you think your moves could use a little lightning
That's when he turned to me and said, and I quote: "BOY!
Use a little less whitening, whitening, YEAH!"
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
YEAH! a da-dat, a da-dat, a da-dat
A da-dat, a dat-dat-dat-dat, WAAAAA-HUH-UH!
Cause I've got everything I want but losing my mind!
YEAH! l-l-l-la, l-l-l-la, l-l-l-la-da-da-yeah!
Body blow, body blow, knock him out!
Dat-dat-dat, dat-dat-dat, dat-dat-dat
Dat-dat-dat, Dat-dat-dat, dat-dat-dat, YEAH!
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many blows to the head, yeah
Left me for dead, but still I fight on
One too many, one, one too many blows to the head
Left me for dead, but still I fight on

In this world I don't belong
But I'm living it
I've found the words to heaven's song
Now I'm singing it
Songs of freedom, words of love
Reveal the saving grace of God
The sound of Heaven on this earth
We'll sing
To God in heaven be the glory
To God in heaven be the glory
Great things my Saviour, He has done
And greater things are yet to come
We've got this treasure in our hands
And we're bringing it
A hidden church bell in this land
Now we're ringing it

Okay maybe you know it better
Oh oh, reality sucks
Nobody helps you to make it feel better
Oh oh reality sucks
And you're a dropout that stays away
Might be that evil took over
Oh oh reality sucks
You're getting to old now
To cause a stampede
Oh oh reality sucks
Oo you're boozing your life away
You're blown your brain away
Reality sucks
Oh ho reality sucks
Now you see your life has passed you by
Oh oh reality sucks
You took a shortcut
Through the junkyard of life
Maybe that's why reality sucks
Now you're boozing your life away
Blowing your head away
But dreams didn't make your day
'Cause reality sucks
Oh oh reality sucks
Reality sucks

Well she wants to be a singer in the band,
Maybe I'll give the girl a hand
And a microphone.
Looks like she's all alone.
She can bring a friend,
Though she's not my kind of friend.
She keeps on staring me out with her
Ole black 'n' blue eyes.
And I can take her dancin'
Just to give the girl a chance 'n'
I was never that good
At being nice when I should.
I guess that she'll forgive me
Right before she tries to kill me
'Cause I sold her on yesterday's
Come take me home eyes.
And I can take you waltzin'
Just so she could kick my head in.
Oh, I do believe I was drunk
And both of my heads had shrunk.
I guess her name was Tina,
'Cause before I'd even seen her
I was lost in her "What's your name?
Just get me...
Oh take me home eyes.
And Chelsea says she's got nowhere to go,
And if she does she's gettin' there slow,
And I can help her out but I've got somewhere to be,
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me.
Young soul shagger,
Beggin' me to bag her
Filthy heart and swollen hips,
And she said, "Oh, my dearest,
I'm not pretty.
Isn't it a pity
That you won't kiss these rotten lips?"
Oh take me home eyes.
Ole black and blue eyes.
And Chelsea says she's got nowhere to go,
And if she does she's gettin' there slow,
And I can help her out but I've got somewhere to be,
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me.
Do do do do do do do do do....

We lived up here in Cambridge
And browsed in the hippest newsstands
The we started our own newspaper
Gave the truth about Uncle Sam
We loved to be so radical
But like a ragged love affair
Some became disenchanted
And some of us just got scared
Now are you playing possum
Keeping a low profile
Are you playing possum for a while
Then you moved to the country
Bought a farm and tilled the land
Then you took your books to India
And got hooked on a holy man
But the wells they do run dry
And the speeches turn to words
And the woods are full of tigers
And freedom's for the birds
Now you run a bookstore
And you've taken on a wife
You wear patches on your elbows
And you live an easy life
But are you finally satisfied
Is it what you were lookin' for
Or does it sneak up on you
That there might be something more

I need some sleep
You can't go home like this
I try counting sheep
But there's one I always miss
Everyone says I'm getting down to low
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spinning round
Everyone says I'm getting down to low
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go

you're such a sweet girl
i'm so sorry when ni lose my cool
seems like sometimes i most appreciate that
when i'm far way from you
and i know that's not how
it's supposed to be, o.k.
and it's usually not, but
somehow it is today
you're such a cool girl
and i really think that every day
and just to prove it's true,
i'm dreaming of you
when you're a thousand miles away
and i know that's just how
it's supposed to be, o.k.
but i forget when you're
close to me
i'm sorry sometimes
don't build up walls of
toughness to protect your
self from me
i'm still the boy you love,
and you're the girl for me
those walls are going to fall
those walls are going to fall
i'm sorry sometimes

The keys to your heart open the door to the world
You've got to give me two days
And woman I'll make you a girl
Sometimes you've got to rewind to go forward
There's some good times around the corner
But have you fed the fish today?
Have you made your wish today?
I need a new eiderdown
I want some binoculars
Don't want to be obvious
I want to surprise myself
I've killed all the mockingbirds
I've wrestled the octopus
I came out with extra arms
To carry your baggage
Sometimes you've got to rewind to go forward
There's some good times around the corner
But have you fed the fish today?
Have you made your wish today?

When I first met you
You were not house trained
A backwoods trier
The world's your oyster
Your time is mine
What's yours is mine all mine
There's no honour
Amongst thieves
So we worked together
A varied rich
and famous crime
You had your motives
I had mine
For a soul to find
Little piece rub off on mine
Trinkets, memorabilia
Diamonds for the taking
One mans treasure
never meant a thing
When I was housebreaking
Took a buckshot landing
From my most famous client
Must have lost it in the fall
Came away empty handed

Look around the country, an abundance you'll find of
Mediocre minds
Sift trough the fodder as the sane justice declines because of
Mediocre minds
Shrouded under cover, the most flamboyant guise hides a
Mediocre mind
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
When the cry foul you had better watch out because you never know which
aptitude they're griping about
Don't act too smart for their stenoscopic ways
You'll be discarded away
Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
So many sighted people act so helplessly
Blind from their
Mediocre minds
If you want attention then you will be asked to bend but the surest
insurrection is enlightenment
Then you can live outside inharmoniously
An enemy
They want to keep me locked away
'cause I'm an overactive brain
Leaders, presidents and the nightly news guys cater to
Mediocre minds
Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
The only natural thing that I despise are
Mediocre minds

Never felt like this until I kissed ya
How did I exist until I kissed ya
Never had you on my mind
Now you're there all the time
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya, uh-huh
I kissed ya, oh yeah
Things have really changed since I kissed ya, uh-huh
My life's not the same now that I kissed ya, oh yeah
Mmm, ya got a way about ya
Now I can't live without ya
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya, uh-huh
I kissed ya, oh yeah
[Chorus:]
You don't realize what you do to me
And I didn't realize what a kiss could be
Mmm, ya got a way about ya
Now I can't live without ya
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya, uh-huh
I kissed ya, oh yeah
[Chorus:]

Casey is an old man who wants to be a teen
He goes to all the dances and they call him cha-cha King
He cha-cha's when the band is playin' rock and roll
He tries to keep in time but the beat leaves him cold
Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray
Chicks told Casey, you better move man
This is only a one night stand
Casey wasn't in time but he was dancin' awhile
Till a cramp caught his leg and he had to change his style
Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray
Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray
Casey finally learned to do the hoochie koo
This might have been fine back in '22
Now, I'm gonna give you fellows just a little tip
If you wanna keep your girl you'll better get hip
Or, you'll be too pooped to pop, too old a soul
You hips are gettin' weaker when you'll try to do the stroll
And every time your feet gettin' to go in one way
Here comes a new dance you'll be left to stray

Lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down.
Oh, drinkin' beer in a cabaret
Was I havin' fun!
Until one night she caught me right
And now I'm on the run.
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down.
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody!
Oh, she kicked out my windshield
And she hit me over the head.
She cussed and cried and said I lied
And she wished that I was dead.
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down.
Lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
Pappy made a batch of corn
The revenuers came.
The draught was slow
So now they know
You can't do that to Mame.
Lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, singing songs in a cabaret
Was I havin' fun!
Until one night it didn't seem right
And now I'm on the run.
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe.
Lay that pistol down.
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down.
Oh, pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down.

There's no-one watching over me tonight and I'm afraid to turn out the lights,
If I close my eyes, it'll all go away and I don't wanna see it end this way.
There was a time when truth and trust meant so much more to each of us
And all the dreams that once we had have seen the sun and left us feeling bad
Now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard
I'll keep my business, but I'm a little bit afraid
Through the years one thing hasn't changed
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey
I would run through fields of fire,
I would crawl on broken glass,
Just to swin in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance
That's all I ask
Now feeling good is not good enough, I know they've changed but not that much
Midnight time has left us feeling beaten up, I never was one who needs to give enough
I ain't a hero who gets the girl, but if I had my chance to save the world
I won't blow it now, I guess I'll understand
This boy becoming a man
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey
I would run through fields of fire,
I would crawl on broken glass,
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance
That's all I ask
Well, look at your hands if you hear what I said.
Can you count on your fingers each of your real friends
I know that I'm lucky, I know I'm right.
Fingerst turn into fists, we're here to take on the night.
That's right
Now I'm staring at an open door, we've had a lot and I want much more
You can keep all the money, and the streets that's painted gold
If someone gives me back my soul
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-hey
I would run through fields of fire,
I would crawl on broken glass
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance
I would run through fields of fire,
I would run through fields of fire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I would run
All the way back home, I would run,
Baby come along

Let's see a mortal type
Receiver!
This new one's made of skin,
I can see her!
She will get eaten up by
All kind people!
Avoid the eye of contact!
She's seen it before
And she still wants more
Help came, but you can't fight fate
Can't help the skin receiver!
Crawling in, through your flesh stew,
The brew's in all of you
You're flying out of reason!
Sexy wings you beware
They'll come with reason!
The stampede crushes you!
She's seen it before
And she still wants more
Help came, but you can't fight fate
Can't help the skin receiver!
She's seen it before
And she still wants more
Help came, but you can't fight fate
Can't help the skin receiver!

One hundred and twenty five
Beats to, beats to the minute
One hundred and twenty five
You get the notion with the motion
Then you're out on the floor
Fahrenheit, one hundred and two
Centigrade, it's getting to you
Your heart is beating, eight to the bar
You can't control it so you hold it
Then you're out on the floor
On the floor
You feel it coming to ya
On the floor
You know it's getting through ya
On the floor
You can't control the feeling
Let it go
See the faces passing
Smile in time
See the faces passing
All in line
You say, Hey! Can I take you home tonight?
But she knows that you're throwin' a line
She's heard it before, she'll hear it again
It's the same pitch every time
Change your line of patter
Make her laugh, not at her
Change your line of patter
Make her laugh, not at her
She tells you her friend wants to say hello
But say that you don't want to know
It's her that you're throwing your glances to
Her that you want to know
Don't let her stray it's a Saturday night
The Boys are after trouble
You're in for a fight

Smile in time
She says if you're lookin' to take her home
Well I'd better not be in late
But the look on her face
And the smile in her eyes say
Baby I'm gonna wait
See the faces swimming
Hear the music dimming
Well I'm all danced out, I'm all done in
And I'm starting to talk out of tune
We can go on a ride, we can jump in a boat
We can dance by the light of the moon
One hundred and twenty five
Beats to, beats to the minute

Forget everything I'm about to say.
It's important you appear startled.
I didn't survive the crash.
This is nothing personal.
I just had to stop shaking.
I'm sorry, but I don't feel as if I'm in any shape to comfort you.

Diane...Down deep inside I cry
Diane...Without your love I'd die
Diane...You know you drive me wild...Diane
You're such a little evil child ya ya ya
Ya, I wanna pack and leave and slap your face
Bad girls like you are a disgrace
A way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die
I should drag you down 'cause you're no good
You're two-faced, your heart's made of wood
A way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die
Listen to my heart
Oh you're tearin' it apart
Oh why don't you understand
Why don't you stop it! stop it!
Stop it if you can
I want to spread the news that you're untrue
But Diane what good would it do
'Cause way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die, I'd die
Ya! Don't you understand Diane
I said ya, ya, ya
I said listen to the beat
Oh I feel it in my feet
Now it's my heart Diane
Why don't you stop it! stop it!
Stop it if you can
I want to spread the news that you're untrue
But Diane what good would it do
'Cause way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die, I'd die
Oh yeah

in the quest for the test to fulfill an achievement
everybody's only in it for themselves
when the fact of the matter is they just don't care
to extend a helping hand to anyone else
so tell me why, did you have to lie
and try to make me all confused about the U.S.A.
when the fact of the matter is you just don't care
to comprehend or understand a single word I say
I don't want to have I go against I
oh let me tell you
the same old story, no factual glory
I against I against I against I
and I say I don't like it, and I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I
almighty watching, almighty watching
I against I against I against I
and I say I don't like it, and I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I
I said who's gonna tell the youth about the drugs
about the drugs, mugs, bugs, and the police thugs
about the rotten stinkin' rackets and the fantasies
around the nation, around the nations
oh baby what you gonna do
I tell you the truth is looking straight at you
I got a brass continental with a 300 Z, two color t.v.s,now a video too
I got a rest home in Jamaica for my fantasty, for my family
around the nation
around the nations
what you gonna do.

Baby, how could I have been so vain
To make you think that you're the only one to blame.
For all these distances and all of this pain
Baby, how could I have been so blind
To presuppose that your needs were just like mine
You've been a prisoner for a long, long time.
But now you run from me
And I will set you freeIf that's the way it must be.
I tried so hard to make you part of me
That every time I looked at youI thought I'd see
Someone that you could never ever be.
So full of pride that I could not see straight
I thought you'd changeIf I could only wait
I see the truth now but it's much too late
Cause now you run from me
And I will set you freeIf that's the way it must be.
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean
Oh--oh.
Is there nothing left but silence in between.
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean
Oh--oh.
Is there nothing left but silence in between.
Baby how'd we hold on so long
To something both of us must have known was wrong
We're either fools or must be terrible strong.
Cause now you run from me.
And I will set you freeIf that's the way it must be.
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean
Oh--oh.
Is there nothing left but silence in between.

The world's gettin' worse, gettin' worse so they say
But I just don't see it
'Cause I see a miracle everyday
When I look in my own fate
I'm tired of all this pain and negativity
I know it's tough for us all
Don't tell me I can't fight, I'm dumb enough to try
Maybe we'll fall or maybe we'll fly
Life's like music, I won't turn it down
Gotta live it loud
And love's a groove that keeps us spinning round
In this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful, in this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful, in this beautiful messed up world
Oh, people say, people say that the world is so cruel
But I just don't buy it
There's in beauty in everything life throws at you
If you're looking for the truth
I'm tired of all this pain and negativity
I know it's tough for us all
There ain't no guarantees but I'm dumb enough to dream
Whether I wake with a smile or a scream
Life's like music, I won't turn it down
Gotta live it loud
And love's a groove that keeps us spinning round
In this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful, in this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful, in this beautiful messed up world
Keep your head in the sky and your feet on the ground
Let your voice become part of the sound
So be right, so be wrong, be whatever you are
In this beautiful messed up world
Life's like music, I won't turn it down
Gotta live it loud
And love's a groove that keeps us spinning round
In this beautiful messed up world
Life's like music, I won't turn it down
Gotta live it loud
And love's a groove that keeps us spinning round
In this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful, in this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful, in this beautiful messed up world
In this beautiful messed up world

For the last year
I've been searching
I needed something to believe
I'm a gambler
With my fortune
Trying to keep you up my sleeve
When I'm away
I fill my heart with
Dreams
I lose myself
Keep my silver dreams of you
Are you lonely
Are you crying
Are your tears for me
When I come home
And I touch you
What will our eyes see?
For the next year
I'll be traveling
Roads that take you far from me
Time can take love
Time can fade love
I hope that you'll remember me
When I'm away
I fill my heart with
Dreams
I lose myself
keep my silver dreams of you
I lose myself dreaming silver dreams
I lose myself dreaming silver dreams
Silver dreams
Silver dreams
Ah

If you wanna go and leave your man
Go on, Ill understand
But then the night gets dark, all is still
Pray for me, I know you will
Hard row to hoe all by yourself
We hit the city and it swallow you whole
You got no friends darlin to satisfy your soul
And then the sidewalk ends, lights all red
You say it yourself, better off dead
Hard row to hoe all by yourself
Walk out on me, walk out on him
You need no man to do you in
But if the night gets dark, all is still
I'll pray for you, you know I will
Hard row to hoe all by yourself
All by yourself, all by yourself, all by yourself

If you get the opportunity, you won't take it I don't get it.
It might look better on the other side, you won't go there you're not known there.
chorus:
And now it's falling in on you.
If there was anything that I could give you,
you know I'd give it all to you, but you've got to find it for yourself.
If you get the opportunity, you won't take it I don't get it.
It might look greener on the other side,
you won't go there you're not known there.
chorus (2x)
No-one else can find it for you!

I stopped and asked a strange old man who was looking to the East,
if perchance he knew the time of day.
He looked at me so suddenly and with such a fiercesome gaze,
that I could see the wisdom in his eyes.
"Having eyes to see," said he,
"can you not read the signs that are written in the sky and on your soul?
For now the sky is burning red and there's just one thing left unsaid:
Apocalypse isn't future tense, apocalypse is now.
Apocalypse in the present tense, apocalypse is now."

Along this path of sorrow
Along this winding road
I find myself travelling
Where sorrow is unknown
And chaos calls to chaos
Below the waterfalls
All Your waves crash o'er me
I'm crushed beneath it all
But I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering
Sometimes I often wonder
If You have let me down
Why does it seem I walk alone
Where trouble finds me out
But sorrow as my company
I fix my eyes on You
Soon again I'll praise Your name
And feel my soul renewed
As I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering
Oh I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering
A traveler never reaches
That sacred place alone
A light to always guide you
Along the narrow road
So steadily I keep my stride
Through every briar and thorn
Although my flesh will falter
My hope is in the Lord
Because I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering
Oh I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering
Oh I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering
Because I know, I know
You remain the same
Even in, even in
My wandering

There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman
She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star
She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
Ooh I had a strange kind of woman

Save the Weak (5:30)
D. Davidson
Take a look at what you have, and the things you own.
And thank God that you've grown.
Children starving and lonely, no place to go.
I really feel that there's hope.
Feelin bad I'm feelin sad, let's lend a helping hand.
Oh save, oh save, save the weak.
With a little love, that's all they need.
All the love in your heart and the love inside.
A people cruel and cold yeah.
Children starving and lonely, no place to go.
I really feel that there's hope.
bridge, chorus, lead, chorus out.

You think I clog up the drain
That it all sounds the same
You hear the strange sound
This is what I am
No apologies
You say you are the real
You say you are the real
No one wants this
Nobody but you
Incapable of waking up
Emnity
Its you or nothing
Id take a blank wall any day
No more wasted breath
No more
If its so simple
Everytime
I die in your conflicting mind
If its so simple
Everytime
I die in your conflicting mind
You say you are the real
You say you are the real
The real coward

No the doctors didn't tell you,
that you were dying.
They just collected their money,
And sent you on your way.
But you knew all along,
went on pretending nothing was wrong,
you said I will keep my focus, till the end.
And in the journal you kept,
by the side of your bed.
You wrote nightly in aspiration,
of developing as an author.
Confessing childhood secrets,
of dressing up in women's clothes,
Compulsions you never knew the reasons to,
Well everyone, you ever meet or love,
be just relationship based on a false presumption,
despite everyone, you ever meet or love,
in the end, will you be all alone?
As the disease spreads slowly through your body,
pumped by your heart to the tips of your arms and your legs,
your greatest fear was that your mind wouldn't last,
your coherency and alertness would be the first things to fade,
as your hair thinned, as the weight fell off, as your teeth blackened,
as the lesions spotted your skin,
as you fell to your knees in the center of the stage,
as you offered witness to mortality in exchange for the ticket price,
as the lights blended into the continuing noise,
as all hope was finally lost.
Adrenaline carried one last thought to fruition.
Let this be the end.
Let this be the last song.
Let this be the end.
Let all be forgiven.

The walk home from barbecue is very long when I'm walking with you
The sun is coming up, and it is coming to light
That me and you were never that tight
And then you stand there with your old botfriend
And message after message, and you can send, send, send
You Know I will definitely ignore them all
You're having a shit night, well I'm having a ball
You showed you're face at the aftershow, how did I know that you would say you will go, it's because you're always listening to him, He's only average looking and a bit too thin

You got me right where you wanted me
So what do we do if I can't hold this pose for too long?
Do we shoot again, or does the whole operation shut down and we go back to the board?
I practiced all my lines, oh yea I'd feed every child in the world
But it's a one night stand baby
We gotta keep on
If you got it all then you got it right
I'm gonna do what you say and get way out of line
Nobody's gonna stop me now
It's not how it looks unless you saw nothing
We all agree this proposal's been sentenced to death
Are we baiting the right hook to catch your attention?
The media needs another blackout
We've been calling
Flooding hotlines
We've applied mascara to the radio but that's just a quick fix and we need a little more
Does it matter to you at all?
Are you listening or have you tuned out?
We've gotta get it together
But first we drink and we take it all apart
Everywhere we go we're the local boys and we're back in town
Well that's the way it is
It breaks my heart
We've applied mascara to the radio, but that's just a quick fix and we need a little more
Does it matter to you at all?
Are you listening or have you tuned out?
Get by
Get gone
Get high
Get wronged

Take me through this darkness
Carry me through this world
Insane and lost confusion
Forever always pushing for more
No, you can't cry
Oh, you can't cry
When you're too tough to die
This grave which bares my soul
This grave which bares my name
Lord I ask no questions
Hold me once again
Forever high
Always high

loose yourself in it.....
loose yourself in it.....
loose yourself in it.....

All right!
Break me down, you got a lovely face
We're going to your place
And now you got to freak me out
Scream so loud, getting fuckin' laid
You want me to stay, but I got to make my way
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Take it off, the paper is your game
You jump in bed with fame
Another one night paid in full, uh
You're so fine, it won't be a loss
Cashing in the rocks, just to get you face to face
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Get the video
fuck you so good
Get the video
fuck you so good
Crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Crazy, bitch
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back, come on
Baby girl
You want it all
To be a star
You'll have to go down
Take it off
No need to talk
You're crazy
But I like the way you fuck me
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
Hey
You're crazy bitch
But you fuck so good, I'm on top of it
When I dream, I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on
You keep me right on
You're crazy
But I like the way you fuck me

There's only one bar in this town I get drunk at,
still I have open tabs at two.
I dated the waitress at the third bar I'm thinking of,
and there's four bar in this town I can't even go into.
My friend Kenny used to tend bar at the fifth one,
still tends bar at the sixth one too.
The seventh bar on this block has a kick-ass jukebox,
the eighth one will let you smoke inside after two.
I've sung songs in about nine bars in east Nashville, Tennessee, but I know I've been to at least ten.
I'll always go back to good ol' eleventh street bar in New York City, when the twelve bar blues has got me down again.
I got, twelve bar blues, too many bars to choose.
Well I will drink tonight, and get me feeling alright
How many roads must a man walk down, to find an affordable bar in the city of Los Angeles
Or even more so to find some affordable company,
seems you have to pay for the conversation there in one way or another even if you're not directly involved.
You're always overhearing that story about the one that got away, or the movie script that one is writing that's gonna change everything.
Feel like if writing stuff down ever changed anything,
a lot more people would know who Philip Levine is.
He was an american poet laureate, one of my teachers forgot to tell me about him in school, probably 'cause his poems got bad words in them.
Talk about board of education, American style.
I got, twelve bar blues, too many bars to choose.
Well I will drink tonight, and get me feeling alright
So hang some taxidermy up on the wall, mute the TV.
That pool table over there gives out every other game for free.
Don't tell anybody though, the manager doesn't know anything about it.
That's kind of the way it is at our bar,
it's a litte broken and it aint that great but hell man,
it's ours.
One time this guy came into our bar,
sang karaoke style Hootie and the blowfish.
We had to ask that guy to leave.
Not cause we don't like Hootie though.
Hell man, I hear Hootie is an alright guy.
So Hootie this beer is for you my friend,
shine on you crazy diamond.
Don't let the bastards get you down,
hold my hand, I only wanna be with you.
I got, twelve bar blues, too many bars to choose.
Well I will drink tonight, and get me feeling alright
Don't you know I got, twelve bar blues,
too many bars to choose
Well I will sleep tonight, and get me feeling alright.

The archers come to the edge of ferns
The wind it floats so cold with words
You're in and out of sleep tonight
It lead you to the shed to hide
Breathing in the dark
They're finding where you are
If you are, then you know the phone's tapped
The last of the maps are breaking codes
You've seen the night thieves
Like sharpened knife bleeds
Through the moon shows, you're in reverse
The moon shows that you're in reverse
Breathing in the dark
They're finding where you are
Breathing in the dark
They're finding where you, you are
Breathing in the dark
They're finding where you are
Breathing in the dark
They're finding where you are

When I called you in the morning
You were struggling for sense
You were journeying through memories so vicious
You made all your dying wishes
Come true
But, I know you're gonna try
To live without love by and by
But that's not living
That's just time going by
Going by, my love
Another ship in the bottle
Has got no place to sail
To see the waves getting darker every hour
The stars have lost their power
In the sky
But, I know you're gonna try
To live without love by and by
But that's not livin'
That's just time going by
Going by, my love

Time to get busy for some rock'n'roll
You better get your ass into it, just lose control!
Stockholm, Sweden, everybody's bleeding
I need some action so give me satisfaction
Turn on the radio, turn it up
I wanna show you the station with the heavier rock
'Cause I'm a B A N D I T
Gonna bang that head that doesn't bang and do it for free
So baby be my bandit wife, I'm so damn hardcore
I'm a bandit for life
Stockholm, Sweden, rock home leading
The one you overlooked but always believed in
Turn on the radio, turn it up
I wanna show you the station with the heavier rock
'Cause I'm a B A N D I T
Gonna bang that head that doesn't bang and do it for free
So baby be my bandit wife, I'm so damn hardcore
Well I'm a bandit for life
You wanna play my game? I'd love to see you play my game, punk
So if you play my game, you're in the game
I see you love the change, we'll I stay the same
I'm a devil in disguise with a fat cigar
I rock and I roll right behind that bar
So don't tell me how to live my life
If you want to become my dear bandit wife
If you can't come out 'cause you're feeling sore
I'll just start a moshpit outside your door
'Cause I'm a B A N D I T
Gonna bang that head that doesn't bang and do it for free
So baby be my bandit wife, I'm so damn hardcore
Yeah, so damn hardcore
Yeah, so damn hardcore
Well I'm a bandit for life

Last night while i was asleep i washed
Away my pores and had my last
Conversation with you the way i usually can.
There were whirring little spinners
That tickled the rough of my hands
And a weekend exchange of what i want
You to know just in case you
Wanted me to take your hand
Well i can see the blazing good
And my love for your mellow soul
And i can't hate you 'cause you're free
And you'll be wealthy when you're old
Kissing in the flaccid points between our
Sin soaked night, and we spin wax with favoring dream mixing our heads
Up with weak, there were moments which i would regret and then later ask why
And when i went outside as if nobody knew
But the sky, to whom i made shady deals
Regarding money and girls
And i can't be done with cheap thrills
And when i thought i felt safe
While i could scrape at my old love
There was a mountain of new taste
Hey motion eye, oh how you've turned
Into a certain type of ugly person
When your ship has sailed then all
Of your shit will fly away

Young, so far
Fine form
And your force
Is gold
Youth so rolled
The boy
And your form
A lucky guy
With thousand town
With thou's own town
Wisconsin Beach
I'm talking, no
And if I'll face above
I'll call back honest of
And just let Pete be free

Please, don't flatter yourself
You're not the only one
Whose heart has ever fell
Please, don't exaggerate
Don't tell me you're okay
Okay, okay
[Chorus]
I will admit if you'll admit it
It's harder than we both thought
It's easier to fall apart
Look where we are
I can forgive it, I can't forget it
You left me here with all these scars
And you can't deny the hardest part: I'm not in your arms
We're hurt more than we appear
The world will never know
We both have taste in tears
My dear
You're denying what I say
Don't act like it's okay
'Cause it's not okay
[Chorus]

Where did you go?
I can't see you
Hiding behind your charade
Was it hard to
See that I would
Carry your weight
When the road was too dark
To navigate, love
Heard me crying
In the bathroom
Leave and dreaming
Didn't you, oh didn't you know
All I needed was my best friend
To come back from wherever he go
Babe when we ran through the halls of hotels
And love that we made was a love hotter than hell
And your arms, my blanket at night
The touch of your lips was my paradise
All of this time I should have stuck up for myself
It's a crime, was so bad for my mental health
I remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect
Babe there were times I felt lonely
Lying next to you at night, that wasn't right, no
Should have let go of your ego
Turned to see the girl you loved when we first met
Babe when we ran through the halls of hotels
And love that we made was a love hotter than hell
And your arms, my blanket at night
The touch of your lips was my paradise
All of this time I should have stuck up for myself
It's a crime, was so bad for my mental health
I remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect
I was still there
Hiding somewhere
Me with my anxiety
Forgot to breathe
It was so hard
Just to let you know
You're up in your adrenaline
After the show
Babe it's a shame that the game went the way it did
I've loved you forever
Both you and your kid
-- the fifth floor if it ain't you old age
And after the last time that you leave the stage
Though I loved you for everything, all that you are
Though I've settled all the lonely you sustained
All -- so skin to skin
My best friend, lover, my company and I
Remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect

Head hurts
back here again, I
painted the walls,
the cracks remain, and
I fear,
to close my eyes,
become accustomed,
so dig in.
Every time,
I breathe this air,
the sick stench,
never seems to go away.
You fail,
You break,
You freak,
You falter,
You lie,
You kill,
You burn,
You're nothing...(x 2)
to me...
Head hurts
back here again, I
painted the walls,
the cracks remain, and
every time,
I breathe this air,
the sick stench,
it never seems to go away,
...go away . . .
You fail,
You break,
You freak,
You falter,
You lie,
You kill,
You burn,
You're nothing...(x 2)
I feel it changing,
the air...clean...
it's you...
You fail,
You break,
You freak,
You falter,
You lie,
You kill,
You burn,
You're nothing...(x 2)

We lay the night in anguish, snakes drawn out by the tide
The compass of decision falls always on one side
But many went before us, and still the cries are clear
There is no beauty here, just the stench of wine and beer
We save no souls
We break no promises
We can do nothing more than move on headlong through the gloom
The thorn between our lips is the missionaries tune
Men with open arms turn their faces half away
Observe as we approach that we have not come to save
We stand as thick as vines, though the fruit is torn away
There is no beauty here, friends, just death and dark decay

"Sink Into The Underground"
I can't breathe I can't get this out
Don't know and I can't explain
But still I feel that I will... I'll be the only one now
Can't seem to penetrate
You can talk about the only way out
I know it's gonna get me again
Why do you have to tell me
The things you tell me
Power can instigate
But I suppose that you'll expose and you'll open up wide
Can't seem to penetrate
Still talking about the only way out
I know it's gonna get me again
I hope the demon doesn't dwell inside you
I know it's gonna get me again
No don't drop me now
I'll sink into the underground
(Lead those sheep to the slaughter)
So alone don't drop me now
I'll sink into the underground
(Can I keep my head above the water?)
Yeah
Still talking about the only way out
I know it's gonna get me again
I hope the demon doesn't dwell inside you
I know it's gonna get me again
[x2]
No don't drop me now
I'll sink into the underground
(Lead those sheep to the slaughter)
So alone don't drop me now
I'll sink into the underground
(Can I keep my head above the water?)
Yeah

(sambora, bryan)
Hey mister can you tell me
What this world's about
It might just help me out
I used to be a dreamer
But my dreams have burned
You know how luck can turn
Sometimes it's hard to find a friendly face
Feel like a stranger to the human race
It's such a lonely, lonely place
I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger, a stranger in this town
Everybody loves a winner
Till the winners lose
And then it's front page news
Nobody loves a loser
When you're down and out
You know there ain't no doubt
I'm just a victim of circumstance
Please mister give me a helping hand
Brother won't you understand
I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger, a stranger in this town
I'm just a victim of circumstance
Please mister give me a helping hand
Brother won't you understand
I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger, a stranger in this town
I mean no danger, I'm a stranger, I'm a stranger
I'm a stranger in this town...
I mean no danger, I'm a stranger...
I'm just a stranger in this town

Lady in Albania works for fifty cents a day
Like her momma's momma did
And if she tried to leave
They'd surely shoot her dead
Right here in my own backyard
There's a little boy who's face is scarred
His daddy says he fell from a tree
'Cause that's what his own daddy said when that little boy was he
Break The Circle
Mr. Smith he's never there
But nobody seems to care
Mrs. Smith wears diamond rings
And the kids are busy playing with their precious things
Break The Circle
That binds us to our destiny
I ask a child on the bus
What will you be when you grow up?
He said I'll do what my daddy does
Stay at home in bed and get my money every month
Break The Circle
That binds us to our destiny

let's go undercover
like young lovers should
cause I can kiss you better
then this letter could
and you say
at least under
these covers
I listen to you
And all this music about you
I hope it finds you smiling again
till never begins
or till forever ends
I'll still be lost in poetics
or lost in the mail
can nobody tell you
these guys have a passion for fashion
but are sincere like a statue
and if you have to choose
I am gonna lose
I always do
we always do
nostalgia is drunk
and frustration can be gorgeous
but can i keep my mouth shut
(I listen to you
And all this music about you
I hope it finds you smiling again
till never begins
or till forever ends )
cause sometimes gorgeous can be frustration
when your life is nothing
but an honorable mention
on a radio, on the radio.
maybe i'm a baby
but i think it's time to grow.
you're everything i live for
-ever got shorter.
i'll know on a radio better
I'm a quitter than a starry
tortured soul
the lips I kissed now shape songs of sadness
hold me dear when I'm away
and I'll know when I hear your name
even if I have to sing it to myself.

Nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
A change in the season
It comes like a thorn in my side
Lost in a maze, lost in a maze
I looked for you, I was invisible too
Sleeping on Sunday
Avoiding the pale afternoon
Deep in a dream, deep in a dream
But nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
When I awoke
I saw a face in the smoke
Chilled by the evening
Caught up in the undertone
I call your name, I call your name
Out of the blue
That's when you walk in the room
A shift in the darkness
You ask me if I still want you
Of course I do, of course I do
But nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
Nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
A change in the season
It comes like a thorn in my side
Lost in a maze, lost in a maze
But nothing seems right
Except for the music at night

When you start your journey, you go and meet your driver
You shake his hand, and hope he's feeling well
The things to come may be somewhat unfamiliar
Like eating herring where the sun does not go down
Our driver calculates what time we'll hit town
And every time a border comes
We go inside and meet with someone
Perhaps a form will need to be filled in
Then we can go and restart up the engines
Plumbing often varies in the various different countries
I like to crouch down and turn on those bidets
I'll have a cocktail, pick at my fingernails
And then I'll squat down for a wash to end the day
Our driver recommends we try the souffle
And every time a border comes
We go inside and meet with someone
Perhaps a form will need to be filled in
Then we can go and restart up the engines
Then we went down under, and we were told of farmers
Who brought some pigs here from the old country
But pigs eat turtle eggs and turtles eat jellyfish
And now you get stung if you're swimming in the sea
Our driver gestures out behind the palm trees
And every time a border comes
We go inside and meet with someone
Perhaps a form will need to be filled in
Then we can go and restart up the engines

You're a little too lazy for genius
You'd rather stay in bed
Rest your eyes
Rest your dreaming eyes
While I'm gone
Rest while I'm gone
You're a little too great for greatness
You couldn't help yourself
Sometimes the world
It gets the best of us all
And it's not your fault
You're a little too lazy for genius
You'd rather stay in bed
Turn in your sheets like a roasting pig
You're greedy, greedy
Could have been the one who saved the world
But you let the world save you instead
But I can't blame you I've done the same
I've done the same damn thing

As I open my eyes for the new dawn
I realize how lost we are
Today's the day when we open the new door
I think that I'm losing my mind
So, release me now
Different ways we have in this life
Our common life is far away from love
Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done
When you open your eyes for the new dawn
I'll be gone and you now know how to live your life
Different ways we have in this life
Our common life is far away from love
Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done
Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done
I think that I'm losing my mind so release me now
Too many lies for my pride, so I say goodbye
Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done
Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done

Nothing ever changes
Except scenery arrangements
In the affectionate hands of
Horse powered assault
Best keep your pants on boy
Behind the armor of fault
Homeless make shift triggers
You'll never walk again
In the choked mouths of rivers
Parted like a sea of loaded infidelity
Best keep your stitched lips
Starched in a giggle
Homeless make shift triggers
You'll never walk again
In piles of clothing sleep the
Stitched lips starched in a giggle

(Instrumental)
In the end of the song are monks, singing a prayer.
''How many years I share the pain younger brother,
how much time I suffer with him.
Know we will win, renew as two of the Phoenix from the ashes,
we will be happy and healthy.
Just have patience.''

Lady Luck, have we run amok?
tripped the snare with my rabbit foot?
Jumped for joy only to be employed
by our worst fear
Lady Luck, have you given up?
Are you scared of my rabbit foot?
Jumped for joy only to be employed
by our worst fear
Didn't it feel better
when we were being bigger?
Didn't it feel stronger
when the love was honest?
Didn't it feel kinder
when you were walking beside her?
Lady Luck, there is plenty of
love to spare and foolhardihood
It's a choice
to feel the heavens rejoice
It's a charm so make it your own

Dragged down into lowercase
Trying to get your cops to talk right
But they can't put the paper in your face
You're just trying to walk by
So now I got a new game baby
No one's gonna recognize it
Your broken English over their flat, tired remarks
Still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life
Isn't it pretty? yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
I can do everything that your man does except for better
Got no interest now in undressing your kids with cheap angst love
Letters
You write your name in all of the places no one goes
Some can't be satisfied until everybody knows
Isn't it pretty? yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
Isn't it pretty? yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead (come on)
Isn't it pretty? yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead

You horrify and petrify me, to wear the crown that just astounds me, you terrorise and paralyse me, you've lost the plot and should be shot down.
You have it all.
You're just a whore and nothing more, your smile is pain yet you remain, walking tall and that appalls me, you're bred like swine but still you'll die in our arms, 'cos you have it all.

As I lie here in the bathtub
I ponder
And I wonder, why did they take her
And squeeze her life away
Paparazzi on mopeds
Fresh air in their heads
Paparazzi on mopeds
Cotton wool balls in their hair
So ugly, so ugly
Why, you just can't justify
So ugly, so ugly
Why, they even watched her die
So ugly, so ugly
Why?
Who was to blame
Was there too much champagne or wine?
It could've been fine
Still I knew about deja vu
Another celebrity dies
And it still mystifies the people
Another icon is destroyed
So ugly, so ugly
Why, you just can't justify
So ugly, so ugly
Why, they even watched her die
So ugly, so ugly
You can't, you can't justify
Justify

I never thought you'd be a junkie
Because heroin is so passe
But today
If you think that I don't know
About depression and
Emotional pain
You're insane, or you're
A fool who hasn't paid attention
To a word that I say
In a way, I can't
Help but feel responsible
I always knew that you were insane
With your pain
I never thought you'd be a junkie
Because heroin is so passe
But I never thought you'd be a junkie
Because heroin is so passe
Now a-day
You never thought you'd get addicted
Just be cooler in an obvious way
I could say, shouldn't you have got
A couple peircings and decided
Maybe that you were gay
In a way, I can't
Help but feel responsible
I always knew that you were insane
With your pain
I never thought you'd be a junkie
Because heroin is so passe

Candle lit, and my eyes are slits
Jumpin' now, paper clip
Make a move, sail a ship
Tap it in, tap it in, ruby lips
She's a mixed up shook up girl
Got me so strung out, I don't know what to do
She's a mixed up, mixed up shook up girl
Take a breath, out at night
Hurry over, she said
But there was no one in sight
Break away, is in her eyes
You know that little girl, she cut me deep,
Inside
She's a mixed up, shook up girl
Got me so strung out, I don't know what to do
She's a mixed up, mixed up shook up girl
Hey, you, I remember
Was all the empty streets
Fill me now
And though you're gone away
I know it's not forever
Why don't you just come over here and tell me, baby
Is it over now?
She's a mixed up, shook up girl
Got me so strung out, I don't know what to do
She's a mixed up, mixed up shook up girl
She's a mixed up shook up girl
She's a mixed up shook up girl
She's a mixed up shook up girl

When I close my eyes
I can see your face
And I want to scream
And I want to chase you out of my dreams
But there is no bed where he used to sleep
And it gets so cold where the one as heat
Now only in dreams
But there's nothing to say
At the end of the day
I'm wasted away
I found necklace that you used to wear
I found a sweater I still smell you there
Now only in dreams
I want to save you anyway I can I'll steal your rings and make these your hands
Yeah only in dreams
But there's nothing to say at the end of the day.
I'm wasted away
Wasted away
I'd rather waste away
I'd rather waste away
Id rather waste away than see you
Only in dreams
Oh
Oh
Oh
But there's nothing to say
At the end of the day
I'm wasting away
Wasting away
I'd rather waste away
I'd rather waste away
Id rather waste away than see you
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams

I'm on a midnight death trip
I'm on a mission from God
A stolen car and a death wish
To hell on Highway 1
Four on the floor, a hundred miles per hour
I'm gonna fly 'til the tires can't fly no more
C'mon!
I've got my blues, gonna make a racket
Nothing to lose but this strait jacket on too tight
I'm alive!
As the wind comes off the ocean
And my hair is combed just right
I'm in a stolen locomotion
Straight out of 1965
So, pass the bottle, a hundred miles per hour
I'm gonna fly 'til the tires can't fly no more
C'mon!
I've got my friends and a sharkskin jacket
Nothing to lose, gonna live it up 'til I die
I'm alive!
Whoo!
Well, on the night before the supper
And I'm gonna smash the glass just right
So, give me one good dose of thunder
Before I fall on my ass tonight
Four on the floor, a hundred miles per hour
I'm gonna fly 'til the tires can't fly no more
C'mon!
I've got my blues, gonna make a racket
Nothing to lose but this strait jacket on too tight
I'm alive!
C'mon!
Ha ha ha!

He can't sleep, he can't eat
He keeps thinking about her behind the locked door of her bedroom
As she knowingly tortures the shell that is left of her bridegroom
And what did he do to deserve
This whore of a wife who parades her disgrace to his face now
When he loved her and gave up his life in more ways than she knows how
And all I can say is that
Love is a terrible art, it's a hook in the heart
That can drag you on broken glass
And as you protest the shards in your flesh
The hook tears out your chest until you're just a broken mess
Where is God in this rot?
Depraved she commits the most heinous of sins and breaks her vows
But he loves her despite all the crimes she devises in his house
Where is God? I've been taught
That He's close to the broken, it's true I have spoken with Him some
When I look in my brother's eyes I can see where his love comes from
And all he can say is that
Love is a terrible art, it's a hook in the heart
That can drag you on broken glass
And as you protest the shards in your flesh
The hook tears out your chest until you're just a broken mess
But he has mercy on her lover and does not bleed him dry
A credit to his self control if it were me that monster would probably die
Love is a beautiful thing, she can make your heart sing
When you're walking on broken glass
She will open your eyes, make your heart feel alive
Point you toward the sunrise
Help you leave all this broken mess behind
Love is a beautiful thing
Will you leave this broken mess behind?

Sunny Sunday at the amusement park
See the fat kids spill their pop, ooh babe
Lots of flags and balloons
But someone sabotaged the rollercoaster last night
Ran a turn and then it smashed right down
Through the crowded haunted house below, oh no!
Human hamburger, no
And it's crushed little kids
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the board-
See the tourists drop their jaws and cones
See the owners smell a big lawsuit, oh, police!
Call your lawyer first
Make the witnesses go home and they'll turn on the TV
And see crushed little kids
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk

It's so real that you can taste
This whole world has gone to waste
You feel crippled
It's not real what you've become
(Hypnotized so many times that you're paralyzed)
(You won't take another look away)
Never meant to be so
Tied into all these clones
You feel criminal
It's not real what you've become
(Hypnotized so many times that you're paralyzed)
(You won't take another look away)
(Know)
You've been warned
(And know)
There is no escape
(You'll see)
When the curtain falls
I swear you've all been warned
It's covered across this world
You're confused about your place
You feel crippled
It's not real what you've become
(Hypnotized so many times that you're paralyzed)
(You won't take another look away)
Never meant to be so
Dressed up in witches clothes
You feel criminal
It's not real what you've become
(Hypnotized so many times that you're paralyzed)
(You won't take another look away)
(Know)
You've been warned
(And know)
There is no escape
(You'll see)
When the curtain falls
I swear you've all been warned
We're lead through the fear
So afraid to be alone
(You won't take another look away)
Here we crawl through life
So afraid
(You won't take another look away)
(Know)
You've been warned
(And know)
There is no escape
(You'll see)
When the curtain falls
I swear you've all been warned
(Know)
(You won't take another look away)
(And know)
(You won't take another look away)
(And know)
(You won't take another look away)
(And know)
(You won't take another look away)

Believe you me the price is clear
A child born the mother near
To death and life as hand in hand
A failed life exposed the man
Who led her off into the flame
To cast her back to hell again
But hear you me the break of dawn
Will wash away the sins thereof
Unto the lake beyond the tree
The child waits alone is he
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains
The flame is gone the fire remains

The wind of life and air from above smells of death.
Angels sing of the end.
Nothing you say and nothing you try can change time.
Human race prepares to die

You seem to be wanting
Everything yesterday
Always the impossible
That's what you seem to portray
Give me one good reason
Why, even if I stay
You won't walk away from me
Tomorrow today
You seem to be wanting
Everything yesterday
Why, all of a sudden
Are you acting in this way
Leave me as you found me
Astound me no more
Who cares what today's like
The morning before
Did you ever stop to ask him
Where he's going
Has it not occurred to you
Without you knowing
You're reducing me to no more
Than a wreck
I cannot stand the pace you're keeping
What's you're meaning

We sailed along the fields of green
I didn't know it was my last scene
Nay, goodbye, nay, adieu
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view
Maybe light caught in my eye
And we were thrown into the wild rye
I hope you know my love was true
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view
There is a hole
For every soul
I slipped right through
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view
Nay, goodbye, nay, adieu
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view

The charade is over now
Still you're trying to hide it somehow
Am I wrong when I say a piece is missing?
Inside is screaming you stay quiet
No one is listening
You're picking up a shell
No one will ever tell
The difference and so the indifference will come
You can't climb out of your empty box alone
Grab your hair but you can't lift yourself up
Still you're telling me to shut up
Don't you get fed up with your own pride?
Realize we're on the same side
You are not the first one
Who lost track of the sun
You can't see that now I know
Don't want to sound superior
But even though I know this is not a cave can't you see the light
I'll walk beside you tonight

Oh baby, bring my gas mask here
Oh baby, honey bring my gas mask here
I got a real bad feeling
You know my mind's not there.
Well I'm full of problems
And now I got a pair
I can not drink the water
I could hardly breathe the air.
Oh mama, honey what's a poor man to do
Well I'm goin' down slow
Got those Ecological Blues.
Come on hit it!
Well it's down by the ocean
I like diggin' by the sea
I caught myself one dead fish
Full of mercury.
Oh baby, honey what's a poor man to do
Well I'm goin' down choking
Got those Ecological Blues
Tell you what you should do:
Oh mama, honey better stick out your hand
Oh mama, honey better stick out your hand
Better stick out your hand
Here comes the garbage man.

I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner, in the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck, ooo
Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims
And the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so, ain't that so
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Meal ticket
Gotta get a meal ticket
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket

Remind me how we used to talk
Remind me how we thought
That somewhere we had
A place to get to
A place that lasted
With nowhere past it
We'd never leave
Where are our precious plans?
Where are those future-less precious plans
Where we had a place to get to
A place that lasted
With nowhere past it?
We'd never leave
A place to get to

Well you watched the sun
Gazed a star and it won't be long
It won't be long
Before you rust, come try your luck
It's just a plan Kafka said
Well careless driver steps on the brake
Better love the envy that you create
Better watch yourself
Watch yourself
Are you ready or not, maybe let's go
Kick your head back and watch it in slo-mo
For all you pretty ones, ya hum along in oblivion
Afraid to be alone, all made up to be someone
Oh, you pretty ones, fade away and come undone
Got to find a better way, to mold your skin or so they say
That's right
Such lofty hymns, a kiss to the world
And take good care, like you ever cared
It's bittersweet and a kiss goodnight
Elevator to the bright side of life, that's all you know
The story goes
Tightropes walking much tripping on clovers
Dissolution yourself from your brothers
For all you pretty ones, ya hum along in oblivion
Afraid to be alone, you're all made up to be someone
Oh, you pretty ones, you fade away and come undone
You've got to find a better way, to mold your skin or so they say
That's right
Oh that's right
Yeah, are you ready or not, maybe let's go
Kick your head back and watch it in slo-mo
For all you pretty ones, ya hum along in oblivion
Afraid to be alone, all made up to be someone
Oh, you pretty ones, you fade away and come undone
Got to find a better way, to mold your skin or so they say
To mold your skin or so they say
To mold your skin or so they say
That's right
That's right
That's right

When a room becomes an altar
and what beast that must exist
it flies with music from our lips
and steals a kiss and blows it
out into the mist
where castles stand on cliffs
and cobbled streets they wind and drift
and moods are made and set but shift
this place where skies are low
and birds are big
We went to sleep in day
and woke again the same day
we have learned to cheat the time
and find the hours
that the clocks cannot define
as I looked up from that stage
I felt the thing that had been made
And how it raged
And how it raged
How to explain?
Something makes me howl
and shiver to the core
ah outside if it was raining
then inside there'd be a storm
we've got a pair of hands for climbing
and a pair of knees to spring
and a pair of balls for strength
and a pair of lungs to sing
and these simple chords
that say: music is the language of us all
To write these songs is to be written
ah the chorus always knows
what is in store
and what is more the thing that sings us
is the thing that makes us roar
I felt that beast 'kisso my neck
we clapped our hands
and heard them spread
there was a trumpet and a call
a pack of Spaniards screamed for more
music is the language of us all
music is the language of us all
music is the language of us all
music is the language of us all
I find it hard to speak emotional
cos these things are the things that
can't be said
and when it's struck it strikes
the memory from our heads
once I wrote to play's
to be immortal for a night
and despite the unknown hours
something happens
when the light turns out the lights
then we fade and yawn
to music that's the language of us all

(Put the little kids in the corner with their face and their eyes in the corner)
My favorite band is a witch
Find themselves in poet corners, and they still like to dick
It's of course, they're afraid, it's a fine, complicate
You can find, demonstrate, slip along, demon ways
My favorite band, is a witch
Find themselves with perfect mornings, and they still try to live
The menstruation, pull it surprised a masturbation, a little morning cries
I wish on thievery of corners
Admit the cries, I know he's saying, I know he's saying so tired
They'll have to put the little kids in the corner with there eyes and face on the floor
You're so fucked up now, you're fucked up now
Put the little kids in the corner with their eyes and face on the floor
Put the little kids in the corner with their eyes and face on the floor
I know you want me to keep on going
You want me to keep on going
And you know wherever I am

Another F again I fret
Another cocky hypocrite
Another dirty look from a passerby
Kiddy porn and lunatics
All the things that make me sick
Another suicide from a sad rock star
So get the fuck out of my face
And disappear without a trace
You annoying little prick
I'll reach into my bag of tricks
And then I'll pull out a hand grenade
Your machoism fades away
But I will not pull out the pin
Because that's mean!
With judgment day not far away
You're sniffing all your days away
I don't know who to blame
Is it me or is it you?
Violent death and viruses
And lack there-of of consciousness
Another shitty song on the radio
Lets go!
I'll kick the teeth out of your face
I killed the cat, there's no more chase
You push on me. I'll push you back
So come on girls, let's go attack
Don't look at me, I've had my fill
Don't find yourself inside a pill
But I will not pull out my gun
'Cause I don't have one!
Why can't you let me be?
Said, Why can't you just let me be?
Why can't you just let me be?
Why can't you just let me be?
Why can't you let me?

got caught kicking the canvas down
i had plans but they never seemed to work out
wide-eyed and on the lookout
got caught tearing the whole thing down
i was halfway done
but then you know this painted scene
could never leave me
oh please believe me
caught killing a camera
now it seems calming and clear to hire
a cast of kittens, the cats we've been kissing
for the cameras we're lowering here
got caught tearing the whole thing down
i was halway done
but then we sang it for memphis
the new slang in frame and canvas
just for the cameras
when we are awake we sing "never... ever"
this is where you must make up your mind
should beauty be design this time?
this time you decide cause we go with whatever
we take our time
got a cough
my throat kills from singing
my ears are ringing
the stage is slowly sinking
and we're all thinking the same thing
let's not settle for satisfaction
we are women and men of action
let's stop clapping let's start doing
a dream for the teens and in-betweens
and twenties yet unseen.

They were called The Runners Four.
Always slipping through the back door
When they come ashore
Sneaking through their precious load,
Cheating customs in a speedboat.
When they come in from far away
Oh they never can stay.
They fly away to other skies
With the sun in their eyes.
Make their entrance two by two
Bringing us a thought that's so new
Whistling secret tunes

Riding high, then shot down
I load my guns to fire another round
I look deep into your eyes
And cant run there's nowhere left to hide
Don't stop, no its much too late
When the night comes I cant wait
Oh I live, love to loose control
It makes me crazy I want to let you know
[Chorus:]
Oh, no, I don't want to fall
Oh, oh, cant you hear me calling
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me I'm the one
When I'm next to you, next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you.
There's a thrill, in the chase
We wont lose when we meet face to lace.
Love, games a means without and end.
I go down but Ill be back again
Through the night with no retreat
When you're with me in my sleep.
[Chorus]

New jersey bounds, When sound asleep
They'll find You at your most vulnerable
Poll position, Speak up let out
When down the street the corner boys fuck shit up
Scream loud scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine will you follow me home?
Scream loud scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine will you fuck me back home?
Let's fire it up, haha now
Don't let them scare you...
When you're down on the floor bleeding bastard
You'll be getting home real soon and I'll pray For you high health
Don't let them scare you when you're down on the Floor bleeding bastard
You'll be getting home real soon
Speak up let out caught in the crossfire
Compared to the step to the bone that might break
It's too late to find a better way out of this
With the finest regards that I lost in the cracks of this street
Scream loud scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine will you follow me home?
Scream loud scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine will you fuck me back home?
Don't let them scare you
Take me home when you run they'll follow you.

There's a place,
I think that you could take me there.
If you only showed me where...
Cause I've been waiting in despair
If there's a need
To lose my rights and change my name
It is the creed
Cause these rooms starts to feel the same
If the fire comes too close, don't bother
Cause the tides swallows one after another
Sometimes your shadow
And I will hold it by the hand
Cause when darkness fell
I picked it up and did first hand
If the fire comes too close, don't bother
Cause the tides swallows one after another
If the freezing starts to win, don't bother
Cause I'm your follower and you're my lover
Picking up the card my lover
Roll the curtains and the cover
I will line up in your shadow
Sweep the dirty road I follow
Picking up the card my lover
Roll the curtains and the cover
I will line up in your shadow
Sweep the dirty road I follow
If the fire comes too close, don't bother
Cause the tides swallows one after another
If the freezing starts to limb, don't bother
Cause I'm your follower and you're my lover

Sugar boy its all over now,
Sugar boy its all over now,
Ain't your loving,
But the things that you do,
Listen boy I'm getting tired of you,
Sugar boy what you trying to do,
Well I told you I loved you,
Now what more can I do,
Told you I loved you,
You beat my heart black and blue,
I told you I loved you,
Now what more can I do,
Do you want me to lay down
And die for you.
Sugar boy its all over now,
Sugar boy its all over now,
Went to the doctor,
Told me something was wrong,
Listen girl you shouldn't feel so alone.
Sugar boy what you trying to do,
Well I told you I loved you,
Now what more can I do,
Told you I loved you,
You beat my heart black and blue,
I told you I loved you,
Now what more can I do,
Do you want me to lay down
And die for you.

That night I still remember
It was warm in the middle of summer
Your voice like a lullaby, so low, so sweet
Thought you had me but I'd never been so free
Now you're scared but you don't know why
You keep running but there's nowhere to hide
You never thought I'd ever be
Something you want, something you need
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can't get over me
We'll spend the night watching movies in the dark
You're playing bands I've never heard of
And I know you tend to always overthink
But tonight it's as simple as just kiss me
Now you're scared but you don't know why
You keep running but there's nowhere to hide
Scared to care because then you lose
Try and hide how you feel but I feel it, too
You never thought I'd ever be
Something you want, something you need
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can't get over me
Take all of your doubts and throw them away
We're falling tonight tell me that you'll stay
You'll stay
You never thought I'd ever be
Something you want, something you need
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can't get over me
You never thought I'd ever be
Something you want, something you need
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can't get over me

Well once we were concerned
The we grew up to be bored
What once resembled rules
Sure enough turned into jokes
We tried to stand for nothing
Now there's nothing to stand for
What started as a game
Became a chore before too long
I don't mean to sound tight
But I see it's hard to fake
So rather this than talk
Get your keys and get to work
'Cause them that do nothing make no mistakes
Where once we asked for lessons
Now it's all to be ignored
How do we trust the speaker
When his calling is to call?
I don't mean to sound tight
But I see it's hard to take
So rather this than talk
Get your keys and get to work
'Cause them that do nothing make no mistakes
Well once we all were told
And we took it all as truth
If we worked hard and behaved
We'd be anything we'd choose
And we used to all be happy
While pretending that we weren't
Now the smiles upon our faces
Show how much it all must hurt
I don't mean to sound tight
But I see it's hard to fake
So rather this than talk
Get your keys and get to work
'Cause them that do nothing

I sit and watch my days disappear
Waste away in fear
Will you wait? Won't you wait?
Will you wait? Won't wait for me?
Do you still believe I'll free myself?
Site in my cell
Sunlight breaks, oh well
Can't you see, what this place has done to me?
Do you still believe I'll free myself?
Did you wonder? Did you notice
How I slept today? Did you wonder?
Won't you just break me out?
I said, break me out
Won't you break me out?
I said, break me out
Won't you wait? Won't you, Won't you wait?
Why can't? You won't
I am, you don't, break me
Save me, liar, I am
Will you wait? Why can't?
You won't
Won't you wait for me?
I am, you don't, break me
Save me, liar, I am
Did you wonder?
(I am, I am, I am)
Did you notice
How I slept today? Did you wonder?
Won't you just break me out?
I said, did you wonder? Did you notice
How I felt today? Did you wonder?
Won't you just break me out?
I said, break me out
Won't you break me out?
I said, break me out

It All Belongs to You
How did I wind up on the ocean floor
Where Id give anything just for one more
Final breath, to tell you how I really feel
Is this it, or one more step to something real
You found me like a treasure lost at sea
And you take my hand; as I cross into the deep
You are with me
I open my eyes, floods of blue skies
Flow like rivers of ten-thousand year-old love songs
And it all belongs to you
Consciousness
The sun rays fade behind the waves of blue
And I found you just like a treasure lost at sea
And you take my hand; as I cross into the deep
You are with me
I open my eyes, floods of blue skies
Flow like rivers of ten-thousand year-old love songs
And it all belongs to you
I open my eyes, floods of blue skies
Flow like rivers of ten-thousand year-old love songs
And it all belongs to you
Fever Fever Kingdom EP lyrics

Thirty candles on the birthday cake
She tries to blow 'em out
Does her best but leaves the one still burning
It's hard to figure out
It's hard to figure out she says
Picking up the knife
When she considers how the one still burning
Best describes her life
She runs her thumb along the knife blade laughing
And cuts the bad part away
Reverend father on the t.v. set bringing her to god
She never met him never held his hand
She thinks it's pretty odd
She thinks it's pretty odd she says, picking up the gun
Blue pistol in the screen light glowing
There's a job needs done
She runs her thumb along the gun sight laughing
And blows the bad part away
They found her hanging in the neighbor's barn
Swinging in the breeze
Long legged with her toes near touching
As pretty as you please
As pretty as you please she says picking up the axe
She's walking out beyond the woodpile claiming
She's gonna bring her back
She runs her thumb along the axe head laughing
And chops the bad part away

If I cried out loud
over sorrows I've Known
And the secrets I've heard
It would ease my mind
Someone sharing the load
But I won't breathe a word
We're two of a kind
Silence and I
We need a chance to talk things over
Two of a kind
Silence and I
We'll find a way to work it out
While the children laughed
I was always afraid
of the Smile of the clown
So I close my eyes
Till I can't see the light
And I hide from the sound
We're two of a kind
Silence and I
We need a chance to talk things over
Two of a kind
Silence and I
We'll find a way to work it out
I can hear the cry
Of the leaf on a tree
As it Falls to the ground
I can hear the call
of an Echoing voice
And there's no one around
We're two of a kind
Silence and I
We need a chance to talk things over
Two of a kind
Silence and I
We'll find a way to work it out

I don't believe this we've been friends for so long
It's so hard to see
That you'd do this to me
You came round asking just to mow the garden
You're a clever guy
'cause you did it for free, FREE!
You think I don't already know
What if I told you
I'm watching you
I've seen you too at the movies
And in the late night ja'causeees
You're screwed
And I'm done with you
So stay well clear and leave my mum alone
Leave my mum alone, mum alone, mum alone
I came home and your car was in the front yard
I went to see
What the fuck was going on?!
And I knew
I didn't ever think things could be so wrong
You unzipped your flies
Now I can't believe my eyes
You think I don't already know
What if I told you
I'm watching you
I've seen you too at the movies
And in the late night ja'causeees
You're screwed
And I'm done with you
So stay well clear and leave my mum alone
Leave my mum alone, mum alone, mum alone
You did it to;
Stephen and Ethan
Joey and Nathan
Josey and David
Peter, John and MIKE!
Alison, Alister, Monica McCalister,
Maddison, Harrison and the guy from Sarrissons
Is so they don't already know!!!!
What if I told you
They all hate you
I've told them about the movies
And all the late night ja'causeees
You're screwed
And I'm done with you
So stay well clear and leave my mum alone,
Leave my mum alone, mum alone, mum alone
What if I told you
I'm watching you
I've seen you two at the movies
And in the late night ja'causeees
You're screwed
And I'm done with you
So stay well clear and leave my mum alone,
Leave my mum alone, mum alone, mum alone.

There's a place
A local roadside shack
A poor man's Paris with a parking lot in the back
There's a girl there
She knows how to unwind
She don't talk much but she knows just how to act
I said, don't tell me she don't love me
The money's just a mere formality
Every day, every night
Somethings going on, something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Any place, any time when I'm fading
My love lies waiting
Down the road tonight
When I was younger
All the older boys
Would drive me way out past the county fair
They'd laugh and point out
This roadside trailer
And say something wild's going on over there
They said, what they're doing
Don't mean nothing to you now
But someday it'll mean everything
There were movies in the parlour
They were dealing one-eyed jacks
And when I said I loved her
She said, just keep coming back

Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
I read the bible everyday
To see what you have got to say
It doesn't make no sense to me
I'd rather read the beano!
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
So what if I dont go to heaven?
It's all a load of '27'
I'll have a better time in hell,
Don't want to be an angel!
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
The things you preach are out of reach
I'm getting crucified!
How viddy he bog as a rabid dog
Selling fucking lies!?
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
Oh Bog!
Oh God, you are my hero,
You're my main man.
Oh Bog!
[til end, some variations]

Flies through the air with the greatest disease
Takes little pills and calls them trapeze
I know you're right
Everything you do is right
Everything I do is true
Bluebell to hell
Lo and behold a girl with a goal
Looks so old she's made out of gold
I know you're right
Everything you do is right
Everything I do is true
Bluebell to hell
I want to live in the smallest corner
In the densest mind in the fuckmost room
And sing "The stars they swing from
Their chandelier strings"
I know real love
You know who you are
You're deadmeat motherfucker
You don't try to rape a goddess

Surprise!
Party!
Yeah, we just thought we'd drop in!
Where's your icebox?
hey, where's the punch?
Ew, house-a-tosis!
Who's to blame when parties really get out of hand?
Who's to blame when they get poorly planned?
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo-ooooooooo
Crashers get bombed, slobs make a mess
You know sometimes they'll even ruin your wife's dress
Crashers getttin' bombed
Who's to blame?
Can you pull it back in line?
Can you salvage it in time?
What can you do to save a party?
Parcheesi, charades?
A spur-of-the-moment scavenger hunt
Or Queen of the Nile? (aah, who turned out the lights?)
Bombed, crashers gettin' bombed
Crashers gettin' bombed, bombed, bombed, bombed, now, who's to blame?
Who's to blame when situations degenerate?
Disgusting things you'd never anticipate?
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo-ooooooooo
People get sick, they play the wrong games
You know, it could ruin your name
Crashers gettin' bombed
Who's to blame?
Can you pull it back in line?
Can you salvage it in time?
Whooooooa!
It shouldn't be difficult!
Try not to condemn!
Okay, who ordered pizza?
I'll be tactful when making the rounds
Be tactful when making the rounds and maybe
You can save a party gone out of bounds (party gone out of bounds)
Party gone out of bounds (gone out of bounds)
Party gone out of bounds
Gone out of bounds

I was really good to her
But now she broke my heart
She looked so young and she seemed so sweet
But I was wrong from the start
She has a way about her
That makes her run around
Now I wonder if she'll ever
Want to settle down
Oh oh
Oh oh
I waited so impatiently
It didn't do my mind any good
I never thought she would set me free
I did all the things that I should
Then all at once I would fold her
'Cause she could not be found
Now I wonder if she'll ever
Want to settle down
Oh oh
Oh oh
I didn't think that I
Would wait for her very long
But I didn't realize
My love for her was so strong
She might be going from heart to heart
She might be puttin' them down
The way she took me all apart
And made me the laugh of the town
She has a way about her
That makes her run around
Now I wonder if she'll ever
Want to settle down
Oh oh
Oh oh

The chips are down, you're in the game
But win or lose you feel the same
Another bottle in the hand
You're sick of life and its demands
You're taking off in the night
You're coming in when it's light
You make it up to the wife
You say you're wrong when it's right
You think you got me all worked out
I"ll see you off you and your crowd
Another bottle takes a man
Sick of life and its demands
Come to me where I can see
Way beyond the stars
So my friends what's here to me
Open up your arms
[Incomprehensible]
I'm coming up, I'm coming up

Can't pretend that you're nothing special
You've got to look at all of your options
You can't decide what to go for
When it's all about trust
You see yourself on the tv
You read your magazine
You can't explain how it's come to be this
Stop and think...
When it's all about trust
This coverage, your centre spread
Your neon light daydream will
Shatter and break
And if you think I'm thinking of
You're value here
You're the one who's losing control
This eventual stop, this break in the mould
I scream down this hotline
Just to feel something
This situation isn't getting any better
I see that look in your eyes (the look in your eyes)
You want to see a pretty face?
There isn't anything wrong with giving up
And for what it's worth
I still hate you

feline
i hope you're lying
cause if these things come so easy
then why am i trying
so hard
i thought it best
to let it simmer
then deliver
pour the facts and feelings
from a fever pitcher
of smoke
a cough and a choke
i can feel you smiling
but you're too far to see
and june is here, june is here
but she's laughing without me
i want to see your eyes
inches from mine
at both nines
we drink up the anger
like wine
laced with sugar
and smoke
i cough and i choke
(so take my hand
we'll jump up together and land
just like the cats can)
these are the things that make us laugh
these are the things that make us cry
these are the things that make our knees shake
for fear's sake
and make our hearts break
it's me and me and baby makes three

You'll never know the hate that I've known
Though you'll pretend that you hear
You're privileged You could never understand
So I will hurt you and you'll see
Desperate indignant with life's how I feel
Struggling to cope with it
Can't let them break my beliefs
Try hard (but) must realize
Life is just passing me by
Nothing comes easy in this world
Uphill battles ahead
Must correct the gross misuse
Of justice and liberty
We must stand up before it's too late
While they bitch and moan and say
That it offends them or someone else
Then we'll become a silent tolerate state
The want to better our way of life
To accept and not to question it
They say that's the way it should be
I think therefore I disagree
Anything I say is wrong
What they decide is what it must be
The sheep are quick to believe
My hate no one can take that from me
Anger the pain the strain
Brewing to explode
Anger the pain the strain
I look towards the future and see
That there's nothing set aside there for me
But a lonely death
With no one to mourn for my passing
Because I'll be another rebel dead
That made no difference in this nation
That doesn't like to hear the truth
Which is
Anger the pain the strain
I'll leave a fuckin scare
Anger the pain the strain
In this elitist life
Anger the pain the strain
In this elitist life
Anger the pain the strain
Cause my hate will overcome
Anything that ever stands in my way
Blinded why can't you see what I mean
The writing is on the wall
Open your eyes to the truth
Open your eyes to my truth
Open your eyes to my hate

Sit back and relax
Crawl into the maze
Within your mind
Leave it all behind
Now allow yourself to
Slide into a world
As real as you want it to be
Actual fantasy

1
close windows and drapes
to avoid flying glass and
water damage
2
close room door and
evacuate to the nearest
designated shelter area
3
do not use the elevator
4
seek protection from window areas
do not go outside the building
this is not a test
in the event of an emergency
don't forget to salvage the scene
a laundry list of spitfire items
and the ring you never wear
hall walls are painted planted
hall walls never sweat
hall walls can manage damage
but we never forget
5
assume seated position in a
shelter area and await notification
that the danger has passed
hall walls are cornered in corners
hall walls stay staked
hall walls can contact coroners
hall walls don't break

I thought you'd tell me the truth
But when you opened your mouth
Out came a family of flies
the book was already read
Could never help us from
Your conglomeration of lies
You probably beleive what you told me
A never ending cycle of greed
Pass it down to each generation
Another flock of sheep to mislead
Scratch me harder
Till I bleed
God the father
Spreads his seed
Liars,Liars
You sell it all to me
Liars,Liars
I'm what you'll never be
And it feels so good when you've
Sold another plot in the sky
Like your teacher before you
Really know how to sell your life
Scratch me harder
Till I bleed
God the father
Spreads his seed
Liars,Liars
You sell it all to me
Liars,Liars
I'm what you'll never be
Give me something
Something real
Everything I see is nothing I can feel
Give me something
Something real
Everything I see is nothing I can feel
Liars,Liars
You sell it all to me
Liars,Liars
I'm what you'll never be

all I want
all I get
let it be captured
in my heart
world on fire
world of pain
find myself wanting you again
all I want
all I need
let it be captured
in my heart
slip my head
up
inside
cradle the soul
that you hide
from my eyes
I can see
so many things
that you want
that you need
I can give
let it be captured
in my heart

In the hour before the devil finds I've died
I'll move slow as my ending descends from the pines
Because I couldn't stop for death
She kindly stopped for me and she stole my breath (Emily Dickinson)
If I'm bound or gagged
If I'm lost or loosin'
I might want to leave from here
Until then I'll still be cruisin'
High above the atmosphere
Well I walked through that hour in a drawn out sleepless bliss
Blinking possibilites shuttered and ceased to exist
Like a prisoner of my personality
My time had come and my body was set free
I went easy from my body but harder from my ways
I lived tall in this life but I was naked at the end of my born days
When desperation rang long through me
Horses whispered in the distance and my body was set free

You know the state
Mind I'm in
How could I get so low?
Erase it from my memory
The hands of fate
They move too slow
I'm goin' down
So hard to fall
I've got to find some peace
And I have got to save myself
You know my Soul will
Be released
You Kill me like an Animal
you kill me
And I won't, no I won't
I won't be no Beggar Man
I won't be no Beggar Man
And I won't, no I won't
I won't be no Beggar Man
No more, no more...
Here come the deep down
Cryin' pain
Now you can taste my blood
And I can see the shallow grave
My malady misunderstood
The Chasm that I lie beneath
Has all but took my pride
But I've been pulled by gravity,
Connected to the storm inside
You Kill me like an Animal
you kill me
And I won't, no I won't
I won't be no Beggar Man
I won't be no Beggar Man
And I won't, no I won't
I won't be no Beggar Man
No more, no more...

[Chorus]
Thank the good Lord for rock and roll, thank the good Lord for gin
Thank the good Lord that women are made to satisfy their men
Thank the good Lord for Black and Red and our good buddy Will
Thank the good Lord most of all for good old Bad Eye Bill
Bad Eye Bill from Mary Ville, got a yellow dog named Black
A blond haired wife called Red, that runs around behind Bill's back
Bad Eye Bill and his buddy Will are known to take a drink or ten
Will would pick up an old guitar and Bad Eye Bill will sing
[Chorus]
Bad Eye Bill got locked in jail 'bout a week or so ago
Swore to the jailer and the preacher that the good Lord had saved his soul
Bill went home found Black and Red in bed with his buddy Will
He shot 'em all and he started singin' and he's still singin' in jail

Something ugly this way comes
Through my fingers sliding inside
All these blessings all these burns
I'm godless underneath your cover
Search for pleasure search for pain
In this world now I am undying
I unfurl my flag my nation helpless
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your kings and queens
All your sex and your diamonds
As I begin to lose my grip
On these realities your sending
Taste your mind and taste your sex
I'm naked underneath your cover
Covers lie and we will bend and borrow
With the coming sign
The tide will take the sea will rise and time will rape
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your kings and queens
All your sex and your diamonds

The way is dark up ahead of me
The way is dark and I cannot see
What I love the most is a flashlight beam
Lighting up the way when I cannot see
The way unfolds like an open hand
The way unfolds like I didn't plan
And only in looking back do we understand
That the way was true as an open hand
Over trials and trouble I've already come
And the net appeared when I needed one
Yes the road is dark and the ground is rough
Most the time a flashlight has to be enough
We move forward one step at a time
Wide-eyed and hopeful, lost and half blind
Mistake by mistake, we all learn to be kind

Better sit down kids
I'll tell you why, kids
You might not understand, kids
But give it a try, kids
Now how should I put this
I've got something to say
You mother is staying
But I'm going away
No, we're not mad, kids
It's hard to say why
Your mother and I
Don't see eye to eye
Say your prayers before you go to bed
Make sure you get yourself to school on time
I know you'll do the things your mother asks
She's gonna need you most to stay in line
Keep in mind your mother's gonna need
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before
No more fights over little things because
I won't be here to stop them anymore
I know you don't want this, neither do we
But sometimes things happen
That we can't foresee
Now try to be calm, kids
And don't look so sad
Just cause I am leaving
I'll still be your dad
Just remember I love you
And though I'm not here
Just call if you need me
And I'll always be near
Better sit down kids
I'll tell you why, kids
You might not understand, kids
But give it a try, kids
Now how should I put this
I've got something to say
You mother is staying
But I'm going away
No, we're not mad, kids
It's hard to say why
Your mother and I
Don't see eye to eye

You're losing a friend, you got it all wrong
It's not about revenge but you're losing a friend
I didn't see it coming with my head stuck in the sand
But now I'm loosing a friend and it's keeping me up
It's the ribbons I tied, I would rather just die
Go to hell and crawl back than let you go
You're losing a friend, you jeopardize me
Bad, bad blood on your hands and see, you're losing a friend
I'm fickle and I'm vain and you trick me over and over again
And now I'm losing you and it's killing me
It's the strings that I tie, I would rather just die
Go to hell and crawl back, then let it all go
My mistake to lose you
Oh no, oh no
So this the end now, I'm losing you
Oh, look at you

Into the Valley of Death,
You'll take your last breath.
But you don't realise,
That the heat can fry your eyes.
Down in the Valley of Death .. ..
Not a soul can live,
Because the heat's too much to bear.
If you battle in the sun,
You've got no chance, it's already won.
There's nothing there to be found,
'cept skeletons on the ground.
You can stand there and weep,
Over things that used ot be sheep.

Inside always trying
To get back inside
But it's so hard
To penetrate pig-thick skin
I'm 'bout as low as I can get
I'd leave but I can't forget
Still I wonder why it ain't right
It ain't right, oh
Ain't right, it ain't right, yeah
'Bout as low as she can get
She'll leave me but she won't forget
And she wonders why
She ain't right, she ain't right
Ain't right, she ain't right
Now we're as low as we can get
Can't leave and can't forget
We ain't right, we ain't right
Not right, we ain't right
Well it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you
When you can see you were only high
It's all up to you so you gamble
Flat on your face and into the fire
Well it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you
When you can see you were only high
It's all up to you so you gamble
Flat on your face and into the fire

We're breakin' out this time
Makin' out with the wind
And I'm so disconnected
I'm never gonna check back in
We're gonna start a new life
See how it goes
Before we're tired and too slow
We'll never get any other life
There's too far to go
So together we make this whole
Can you remember the moment
Did you forget that time?
We were switching a ride in the car coming by
On a Saturday night
You said there's nothing to wait for
There's nothing to know
Were never waking up if we never let it go
I said I wanna believe but I'm out of control
And I've got so far to go, whoa
It's coming out of the dark now
It's dripping off my skin
It's on the tip of my tongue as I drift through my body
Into the city within
And now the people are breathing
The air is alive
It's coming out of the street light
And now the battle is over
Whenever we decide that
There's nothing left to hide
This is all we've got tonight
This is all we've got tonight
We are young and still alive
Now the time is on our side
Right now, we'll make it right now
When every thought is electrical
Right now, we'll make it right now
The dream is coming
You're gonna see how it works
You're gonna see it connect
You're gonna see em surrender oh
Right now, we'll make it right now
Or nothing's gonna change
And maybe we already know the way
Forever every day
Do you know why the spirit's calling
For my end to see?
It reminds us we're alive, this moment,
Of who we are, what we could be
There's nothing to pray for
There's nothing to know
We're never waking up if we never let it go
The fever is coming
It's shaking the ground
The city's alive so tonight we break out
It's coming apart now it's not too far
We'll never know why we arrive where we are
We'll never know why we bring the seed in these times
But if you wanna get high kid, just open your eyes
This is all we've got tonight
This is all we got tonight
We are young and still alive
And now the time is on our side
This is all we got tonight
This is all we got tonight
We are young and still alive
And now the time is on our side
This is all we got tonight
This is all we got tonight
We are young and still alive
And now the time is on our side

Stars spinning,
the earth forgiving our backs.
Pines season
the cool wind as we fill our chests.
Babe, you dropped the hammer of love,
you dropped the hammer of love
on me.
Babe, you dropped the hammer of love,
don't drop the hammer of love
on me.
Beer flows through
tequila through Lucy's sequins.
Kids snoring,
the boom box sings "Dandelion".
Now you're in the stars
up in the autumn lights -
A stage set the befits
a Chieftain of our tribe.
Don't forget me
as I await my flight.
I wish on a star
for you tonight.
If there is a way it can be arranged -
when my time comes I'd like to, again, share a stage.

Oh boy, I tell you so
Devil man coming for your soul
He's got a big shiny car with wheels that roll
You straight down to the underground
Oh boy, I tell you so
Devil man coming for your soul
He's got a big shiny smile with teeth of gold
Teeth are meant for eating you
Sheep, sheep sleep
While the devil gnashes his teeth
Sheep, sheep sleep
While the devil eats
Devil man got a real nice grin
Shiny watch a shimmering
But ever from the moment that he lets you in
He'll be a drinking up on the blood of your sins
Old, so old
Is the story that you've been told
Old, so old
Is the story that you've been told
Give you all the money and the girls that you please
You'll spend eternity on your knees
He'll come and take you while your asleep
This thieving trickster is bastardly
Oh boy, I tell you so
Devil man coming for your soul
But you still gonna give those dice a roll
And hope to God that he takes you slow
Fool, you fool
He's got a hold on you
Fool, you fool
Devil's got a hold on you

Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to go.
Goodbye to all the souls
who sailed with me so long.
The day has come at last
The sail strength at the mask
This have quickly passed away.
Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to say
Goodbye to all my friends
who sailed with me the longer way.
The bells have all been rung
The songs have all been sung
This long rive is running close.
Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to go.
Goodbye to all the souls
who sailed with me so long.
The coffee pot is cold
The jokes of all been told
The last don't has been rolled away.
Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to say
Goodbye to all the souls
who sailed with me the longer way.
Goodbye, goodbye goodbye.
Goodbye goodbye.
Goodbye goodbye.
Goodbye goodbye.

Woke up this morning,
There I did see,
Those men in blue,
Waiting for me,
Locked me up this morning,
Threw away the key,
Now I'm livin' in misery,
Judge hear my story,
Hear what I say,
She done me wrong and I had to do it this way,
My friends all told me,
I'd better watch out,
But I wouldn't listen,
Didn't know she was going out,
Went to Little Joe's party,
There she was with Joe,
That's when I knew she was the one to go,
Ahhhhhhhhh...
Ahhhhhhhhh...
My friends all told me,
I'd better watch out,
But I wouldn't listen,
Didn't know she was going out,
She's gone and I'm sorry,
Just can't you see?
She made my life so full of misery,
She's gone and I'm sorry,
She's gone and I'm sorry,
She's gone and I don't know what I'll do...

What if I were you and you were me
Still can't see the forest fire beyond the trees
Now I'm standing in a field of green
The colours burning far as I can see
What do you see?
On my tongue, the galaxies so small
Here I'll drink it down and watch the world dissolve
Now I'm pouring through the universe and slipping
Through the endless stream of time
What would you find?
And I'm flying, floating on the wind again
Hoping it will drag me in
Can't you see I'm laughing?
Laughing at the consequence
Laughing at this circumstance
Don't you know by now?
Wave at all the faces; they go by
Faster that we live, the more we die
Now I'm crashing through the open door
And smiling in a most peculiar way
What would you say?
And I'm falling faster than the waterfall
Opened up and after all
Can't you see I'm drowning
Right here in the open air?
Wishing I could still go clear
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
Flying, floating on the wind again
I'm wishing that you'd drag me in
Can't you see I'm hoping
Wishing I could see myself
Wishing I was someone else?
But don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are

Call me romantic
But I'm frantically fucked up
I had a picture
Sentimentally flawed
Pretty hard to ignore
In my soul
You killed my soul
Soul
You killed my soul
Fatally wounded
And in peace time
Leaving me rigid
That's what I find so
Hard, hard, hard to forgive
In my soul
You killed my soul
Pretty hard to forgive
You killed my soul
Soul
You killed my soul
Pretty hard, pretty hard
Call me romantic
But I'm disappointed
C'mon, c'mon soul
In my soul
La la la la
You killed my soul
Soul
La la la la
You killed my soul
Pretty hard to forgive
You killed my soul
Soul
La la la la
You killed my, killed my soul
Soul, soul
You killed my soul, soul, soul
You killed my soul, soul, soul, soul
Soul
You killed my soul
Soul
You killed my soul
Soul, soul, soul, soul

You are a liar, you've let me down again
I don't believe you anymore
your friendship was a lie
I've never felt so low
Nails in my hands
You have betrayed me, you've crucified my soul
I'll never trust you anymore
I know what Jesus felt
seems like I feel the same
Nails in my hands

Is this the legend of the liquid brain
That crossed the funk muscleman who died in the rain?
He never guessed that the world would end,
Crawling on the beach from the sea to the land
How far can a man go
Crawling on his elbow?
Falling through his window?
How far can a man go
Crawling on his elbow?
Falling through his window?
Is this the legend of the liquid brain?
You're just a turtle, spinning in space
You're just a turtle, spinning in space
You're just a turtle, spinning in space
(And when you return) with black packages of stolen goods
If you don't give them weapons, how you gonna get your food?
We never guessed that the world would end,
Drinking on the beach, and we're driving on land
How far can a man go
Crawling on his elbows?
Falling through his windows?
How far can a man go
Crawling on his elbows?
Falling through his windows?
Ah ah...

It's not that she minded he'd had other lovers
Until that day she never dreamt of their faces
She took it for granted that he'd kissed them on their ears
Just why didn't he didn't he didn't love her
Can you tell the moment a dream dies inside you
Sudden and final and nobody warned you
Now X marks a death-day in red on your calendar
It haunts to ensure that you always remember
You're alone, you're alone, you're alone
You're alone, you're alone, you're alone
He stood in the doorway looking right through me
He lent in to kiss me, but I could sense it was a chore
He used to tell me that I was beautiful
But now he's not sure

(Is she really going out with him?
Not any more!)
Georgina's cooking supper for her husband
All her friends are coming 'round to see the show
Because the thief she calls a husband won't be hungry
When he sees what's on the end of his fork
[Chorus]
Georgina isn't asking any more
And her lover isn't asking any more
And the cook isn't asking any more
Since the thief met a bullet on the way to the floor
Georgina's got a timebomb in her stomach
She knows that any minute now it's going to blow
With all the pain and the silence that she feeds on
With all the hurt that the bruises can't show
[Chorus]
Georgina's got an appetite for vengeance
And she sings all the songs from 'Oliver'
But she won't be wanting seconds any more
As she tightens up her grip on her trigger finger
[Chorus]

Lost and yet surrounded here
No match for present foes
We're children in a battle
Armed in only peasants' clothes
But in the dark of night
When we were sure we lost the fight
You came stumbling into sight
With tree and nail upon your might
We didn't see you coming
Even though our hearts did long
To sing out for a savior
But we didn't know the song
And marred beyond compare
To the lightness that you bear
Ring of thorns upon your hair
We all were suddenly aware
That we were saved
We were saved
Hallelujah
Thank you my King
For you saved the day
Oooo
We were saved
We were saved
Hallelujah
Thank you my King
For you saved the day, my King
You saved the day
And we were saved

I'll never understand
(Come closer and I'll whisper)
Who was that standing in the rain?
If only I could, if only I could remember
What he said
(And how it all began)
Happy the man
With the face that smiles
Happy the man
With the face that smiles
But it has to have a name
(Something strong, something faithful, something pure)
How does he look so safe?
He'll never, he'll never turn away
Happy the man
He'll never turn away
Happy the man
Happy the man
Happy the man

Once I was a slave at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy
Talk about a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill
My work was so hard at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy
Talk about a poor boy
Let me have a dollar bill
See my tear drops falling down
My wife left the sawmill town
She said sawmill life had been a sin
The gravy were too thin
Well if you bring your wife to the saw mill
How you going to please her
How you going to please her
When she wants a dollar bill?

A deep dark secret down at the bottom
But this bay can't keep it unforgotten.
And a story that was told has now grown taller than we'd ever wish to be
Beyond belief
I'll grab the boat if you go grab the anchor,
The tarp and twine and the weights that sank her.
They weren't enough look who showed up
A new light shed is shining through. Illuminating you as we lay
Side by side, dead and broken
Our lives aren't the same since the night yours went stolen.
Blood ran black beneath the moonlight. Your lover's blood ran cold,
Cutting off the hands he used to hold.
A deep dark secret down at the bottom
But this bay can't keep it unforgotten.
And a story that was told has now grown taller than we'd ever want to be
Beyond Belief.
Side by side, dead and broken
Our Hearts aren't the same since the night yours went stolen.
Blood ran black beneath the moonlight. Your lover's blood ran cold,
Cutting off the hands he used to hold.
We used to hold.

The weekend is back
But so is he
Head to the floodlights
See the fraternity
They are waiting
I hear them up in the north
And down in the south
And all that is spewing
Spewing out of his mouth
Entertain me
At his and hers dating
Bored minds agree
Requirements to be stated
Replies awaited
She wants a loose fit
He wants instant whip
He guesstimates her arrival
Will she want it really badly
Entertain me
A car, a house, both in a street
The boredom of the sober week
The weekend's here, hip hip hooray
To make the blues just go away
Entertain me

Stretched into a form that would hurt your eyes to see
She made coffee latte and smiled at me
But then again she smiled at everybody
When I leave that place I'm always speeding
So much coffee in my brain a 'bleeding
A quickened step and a stomach reeling
From thoughts of her lips I wish mine were feeling

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
will find its shore
So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love
Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn
Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say
And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Till there's no more to hide
So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love
Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore

You don't know what you're becoming
Who knows what you're gonna be
We don't know where we're going
We don't know 'cause we can't see
If I could tell your future
I'd say love the world you find
In the dark times and the hard questions
Let some sunshine in your mind
Sun is rising, and I think that's good
You're just now realizing
Some things you never thought you would
Sun is rising, and I think that's good
You're just now realizing
Some things you never thought you would

Here I am
Understand
No one sees
How I feel
How it feels to be free
Why does everything
Come true
The way I don't want it to
Everyone and everything pushing me to weaken
Feel like I am sinking
Wish that I could push this all away
Please you remember
I will never be the same
Please you remember
I will always
Be ashamed
Here I am
Back again
In the trees
Now I'm lost
And I've lost what was me
How could anyone give me
What I want and what I need
Everyone and everything pushing me to weaken
Feel like I am sinking
Wish that I could push this all away
Push this all away

There is a girl I used to know
She had a hundred ways of hurting you, and so
I packed my bags and left her as she watched some TV show,
There is a girl I used to know.
There is a town I used to love
It once contained most everything I ever dared dream of.
My baby in the basement as the traffic trolled above,
There is a town I used to love.
There is a bar I used to know
I still sometimes drop by when I have no place else to go.
It's where the kings of comedy compare their tattered souls,
There is a bar I used to know.
So buy me one more drink before you go,
Or lend me a twenty and I'll get drunk on my own.
You always find some company come in to use the phone,
Someone who can't stand to see a friend go home alone.
There is a joke I used to tell
Some guy who gets three wishes, ends up wasting them to hell.
And in the end, in misery, he tells the joke himself:
There is a guy I used to know
He once had everything that any man could hope.
And now he sits here drinking with a tale that always goes:
"There is a girl I used to know.."

Lord, I question whether I've had my fill
Lord, I question whether I can take much more
You may laugh as I lay here bleeding
No more afters or befores
Some day you'll know just how I feel
You left me there twice before
Some day you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride
Like you were never nothing special
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel
So you say I'm just another dollar
So you say I'm just another day yeah
Once my blood was strong but now its jaded and its thin
Unlike you I can still tell right from wrong
Some day you'll know just how it feels
While you left me there twice before
Some day you'll know just how it feels
Shattered, cast aside, stripped of your pride
Like you were never nothing special
Made you feel like another spoke in the wheel

Those words are all remainders
Echos growing in the heart of twilight
They lay back laughing at naivety's star
Awaken all those whispers
The dusty shadow of a passing favour
I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right
I couldn't see from so far
Was I chasing after rainbows?
One thing for sure, you never answered when I called
And I wiped away the water from my face
To look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of the stranger
Can't tell the real from reflection
When all these faces look the same to me
In every city such a desolate dream
Some days are strange to number
Some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger
A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by
I could have sworn in one evening
And I'm not seized in desperation
No steel reproaches on the table from before
But I still can feel those splinters of ice
I look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of the stranger
I must be chasing after rainbows
One thing for sure you never answere when I call
And I wiped away the water from my face
To look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
Walking away like a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of the stranger
In the eyes of the stranger
In the eyes of the stranger

I've been so blind not to appreciate what fed me and what dressed me. A life can't be represented by what it's worth. So do your part as long as you're on this earth. My earth, your earth, our earth. Alternatives to a learned nature have been made accessible. A life can't represented by what it's worth. So do your part as long as you're on this earth. My earth, you're earth, our earth. Now this concept seems so insane how people can be so inhumane. I've done it but I realize your killing too so open your eyes. Do as much as you can live and let live. Learn as much as you can live and let live. Fight as hard as you can live and let live. Be as strong as you can live and let live.

Some live life with eyes that don't see
They look away at the time of your greatest need
Some talk, some'll just do, some turn their back
Turn around and just walk away I know I've done that
Lonely days and lonely nights
Easy to be cynical never put yourself on the line
I'd like to reach out well why don't I
Take the load up off your back I'd like to try
Let me carry your water
Let me carry the weight
I will bear your burden
Let me carry the load
Working hard sweating all day in the long hot sun
Feel alone with the heavy load you're not the only one
Boss man say time to jump we say how high
If you need a hand getting off your feet baby I'll try
I want to cover you the the sea on the sand
Easy to be cynical never take a stand
Easy for me not to give a damn
I'll ask you to call for me and I'll give you a hand
Let me carry your water
Let me carry the load
I will shoulder your burden
Let me carry the load
Lonely nights and lonely days
You wait for someone to come along and sweep you away
I'll put myself out there it just might feel good
I don't always do that but I think I should

I'm out of control
I think I'm goin' crazy
I'm out of my mind
You can see it in my eyes
I'm lookin' for love
In all of your faces
I'm lookin' for love
I think I'm goin' crazy
I feel tonight
We're bought and sold
Ah yeah
Think I'll overload
Think I'll overload
I'm talkin' about crazy

Too big for the both of us
Get out of my town tonight

Waiting so long
I think I'm going crazy

Feel my direction

A promise is what you keep
I thought it was with you and me
So Why'd you leave me tangled up inside
All these things I believed
We were always meant to be
I can't see
I'm wasted in your lies
It's gone away
to burn burn down
But im okay
Cause I cant hear those words you say
This is the day
I'm taking back that life you stole away
This is the way, I'm leaving you
It's okay, You don't have to change
Goodbye Goodbye..
A fantasy is what you need
Another's life to live and breathe
Well how am I supposed to even try?
You wear me out , you dig in deep
You hardly make your own deceipt
Consequence will find you at the line
It's gone away
to burn burn down
But im okay
Cause I cant hear those words you say
This is the day
I'm taking back that life you stole away
This is the way, I'm leaving you
It's okay, You don't have to change
Goodbye Goodbye..
It's gone away
to burn me down
But im okay
Cause I cant hear those words you say
This is the day
I'm taking back that life you stole away
This is the way, I'm leaving you
It's okay, You don't have to change
Goodbye Goodbye..

Won't you stop, take a breath
Find a moment to reflect
On the pure and simple choices that we fail to see
From the worst to the best
From the east coast to the West
On a neverending quest to end our misery
So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
(Definition of destiny)
Punch the clock to a own
While our lives are put on hold
When did all our childhood dreams begin to disappear?
Well a long time ago
We had passion, we had goals
Why is life so set in stone it doesn't have to be?
So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
Oh get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown.
Along the way, we lost our way
So will you change or stay the same?
So in between, reality
And fantasy is destiny
So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
'Cause I got my own
Yeah I got my own
Yeah I got my own(definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)

Liquid God takes my soul away
Flying high through a bloodshot sky
I fall back down to my water grave
Walking Dead when you leave me dry
Sea serpents surround me
Aqua demons - drowning me
Save my soul from this grave
Liquid God-you have made
Inside your church I worship everyday
unholy water quenches the thirst
There is no future I've drank it all away
Before your altar I accept the curse
Sea serpents surround me
Aqua Demons - drowning me
I swim your seas, limbless, in vain
As senses sink into your domain
Taste his golden blood again
Raise the chalice to the Sea Gods name
As life sips by faith in you numbs the pain
You control this body and mind
Well I've drowned my soul in your poisoned reign
Liquid master - I'm forever your slave
Sea serpents surround me
Aqua Demons - drowning me
Save My Soul

Let me tell you something
That my old man said to me
Your lies have been piled so high
It's no surpriseyou don't even see
All your tricks and all your games
Are all the same
All the days we've wasted
keeping you alive
Waiting for
The Reaper Man
To come rip your heart out
When you find the sin
And heaven's weight's on your soul
The re-emerging days of old
Blinded by the men
The heavens they burn
Swallowing pride
Swallowing scorn
Sit with me here
Listen and learn

We talked for hours
Trying to figure it out
Running out of things to say
Wish I could tell you
I was going to stay
You know it's getting late
Now's the time
Please don't cry
But we've got to let it go
Deep inside we both know why
We've been through this before
[Chorus]
I don't want to have to say goodbye
Tonight, so till we meet again
Maybe another place, another time
I don't know when
But I'll think of you till then
Till we meet again
I know we promised, we would never be here
That we'd never come to this
We tried so hard, as hard as we could
But somehow we just missed
So now's the time
Baby, please don't cry
But we've got to let it go
Deep aside, we both know why
We've been through this before
[Chorus]

So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so
Could admit, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know
Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends
I can tell they really think you're fine
And I've seen you with your other men friends
They don't know if you're a love of mine
[Chorus:]
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
[Chorus]
'Cause you've taken away
The only thing I ever ever had.
Don't you know that I love you?
Why'd you make me feel bad?
'Cause the only thing I ever loved
Was loving you.
So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so
Could admit, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know
[Chorus]
So you think you are something special...
What makes you think you are something special?

In the heart of the city,
I'm awake now,
The buzz open to the night.
You're the libertine.
You're philistine
When I first saw you,
I knew I was done.
You are feel again,
You. I arise
Feeling invincible, this moment?s mine.
[Chorus]
Strangers, landscapes,
See the sky flip inside out,
Turning nightmares into dreams that bring you round.
There's danger in the street,
That's the beauty in the beast.
There's danger in the street,
That's the beauty in the beast.
In a blink of an eye,
You seem to get me.
You are my fox and I can't see your eye
I am the wheel,
The knob of my heart,
I know this road goes back to the star.
You are feel again,
You. I rise
Feeling invincible this moments mine.
[Chorus]
Yellow moon works when everyone's asleep.
Sometimes what you want is just out of reach.
[Chorus]
Strangers, landscapes,
See the sky flip inside out
How you make me turn around
Turning nightmares into dreams that bring you round
Theres danger in the street [Repeat: x 5]
Thats the beauty in the beast

I don't live for the winter freeze
I don't live for the summer breeze
I don't care about any of these
You know I can't help living without you
I don't live for the summer breeze
I don't live for the winter freeze
I don't care about any of these
You know I can't help living without you
There's no point in living without you
There's no point in living without you
No point in living without you
No point in living without your love
We sang the tunes
Still boxed in my mind
You know I can't move
No point in living without you
No point in living without you
No point in living without you
I don't live for the summer breeze
I don't care about any of these
You know I can't help living without you
No point in living without your love

Over Lord Hills Bridge we must go
Where the hearts burn at night and the guns unload
Oceanographers are charting the rise of the seas
Today is a submarine setting course to a land under me
Nature springs are lost in a war
The imperious demands are the local law
It is pulling us down to the Emperor's Gate
Everyone is a submarine, looking for a dream far away

Are you ready?
Been down this street so many times,
Could hit the gas and close my eyes.
And not touch a thing.
The doorways here are always dark,
Keep movin', it's not safe to park.
'Cause this ain't no lover's lane.
It's where infatuation goes,
You hit this long, strange stretch of road.
And you don't know where it leads.
But if we're goin' anywhere,
Only this'll take us there.
So, baby, hold your breath,
And wrap your arms around me, yeah.
Here we go now, a little closer,
Keep your head down on my shoulder.
We're on our way but it's gonna get rough,
On this road:
The road to lasting love.
Look into the rear view mirror,
Remember all that got us here.
We're gonna need it later.
Out the window, all around,
Dreams in pieces on the ground,
'Cause it won't be easy, baby.
You know if faith and hope and trust,
Ain't ridin' in these hearts with us,
This trip's gonna break on me.
Oh, I've never seen the other side,
But, girl, when you look in my eyes,
I've seen it out there,
I believe that we can make it, baby.
Here we go now, a little closer,
Keep your head down on my shoulder.
We're on our way but it's gonna get rough,
On this road:
The road to lasting love.
There's a light up ahead that we all want to reach.
So we grab every chance that we can.
But we lose and get lost.
Just a few get across,
This broken promise land.
Here we go now, a little closer,
Keep your head down on my shoulder.
We're on our way but it's gonna get rough,
On this road:
This road to lasting love.
Here we go now, a little closer,
Keep your head down on my shoulder.
We're on our way but it's gonna get rough,
On this road:
This road to lasting love.
Road to lasting love.
Road to lasting love.

Time to lay claim to the evidence
Fingerprints sell me out but our footprints' washed away
From the docks downtown
It's been getting late for days
And I feel myself deserving of a little time off
We can kick it, hang for hours
And just mouth off about the world
And how we know it's going straight to hell
Pass me another bottle, honey
The Jager's so sweet
But if it keeps you around, then I'm down
Meet me on Thames Street, I'll take you out
Though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce
But I'm warming up because the tension's like a fire
We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
And like a bad movie I'll drop a line
Fall in the grave I've been digging myself
But there's room for two, six feet under the stars
I should have known better than to call you out
(On a night like this, night like this)
If not for you, I know I'd tear this place to the ground
(But I'm alright like this, alright like this)
I'm gonna roll the dice before you sober up and get gone
I'm always in over my head
Thames Street, I'll take you out
Though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce
But I'm warming up because the tension's like a fire
We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
And like a bad movie I'll drop a line
Fall in the grave, I've been digging myself
But there's room for two, six feet under the stars
Time to lay claim to the evidence
Fingerprints sell me out
But our footprints' washed away
I'm guilty but I'm safe for one more day
Overdressed and underage
Do you really need to see an ID?
This is embarrassing as hell
But I can cover for it so well
When we're six feet under the stars
Thames Street, I'll take you out
Though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce
But I'm warming up because the tension's like a fire
We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
And like a bad movie I'll drop a line
Fall in the grave I've been digging myself
But there's room for two, six feet under the stars
Six feet under the stars
Six feet under the stars

Maureen's out on the street again
Didn't get the job 'cause she missed her appointment
She don't know if the kids are fed
They've got holes in their shoes and the cold's coming quick now
The power's off the bills ain't paid gotta jump the box from the neighbor's apartment
Space heaters and welfare checks are as good as it gets in this land of hard lessons
Don't talk to me if you ain't got the answers I need
Yeah I've got problems
Can't you see I'm trying to solve them?
Broke it off with the man in her life finally got the courage to pack up and leave now
She keeps saying she'll be all right but in her mind does she really believe it
Long lines on Piedmont Street but if you hang around you might get a bed there
Turn around and don't look back you've got a piece of your life so take it and run now
The sun is shining on you
Maureen may all your dreams come true
Broke it off with the man in her life you know she ain't got nothing better
Yeah you know she don't but she keeps on believing
The sun is shining on you
Maureen may all your dreams come true

An angel enters in a skull in her hand
Casket for a purse hoping to reverse
Scars that life can leave hidden up her sleave
Performs a silent mass to purify the past
This blackened heart wears virgin white
Oppression lit by candlelight
But then you change before my eyes
I see your face as I am looking through the lens
No more disgrace as I am looking through the lens
An angel sits alone, awaiting kodachrome
Striking dark facade to pose for for other gods
Take off the mask that hides the fears
Those nightmares of abusive years
And then you change before my eyes
I see your face as I am looking through the lens
No more disgrace as I am looking through the lens
I see beyond the painted walls of your defense
I see your face as I am looking through the lens
An angel for a day, she turns to fly away
Removes the wedding gown, there'll be no hiding now
And then you'll change before my eyes

I've got a present for you, open it carefully,
Go ahead darling take you time.
And as you're wondering I grab your pretty head,
Decapitating you from behind.
(bridge)
And as your body's falling lifeless to the floor,
The smile fades from your lips in red
(chorus)
My bloody valentine
Yeah she's all mine.
Ooooh little baby won't you be
My bloody valentine?
Yeah one last time,
Ooooh little baby won't you be
My bloody valentine?
Crimson stains now seeping through your clothes,
Com'on darling close your eyes.
Stone cold little bitch now she's growing cold,
Marking this occasion with your life.
(bridge)
(chorus)

He never put a foot wrong
Until the day Joe met Big William
He made him an offer but he often was wrong
"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you fourpence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"
"Hey Joe, hear what I say
You want my time, I ain't giving away
Go make the money you want some other way"
"I don't want to go to Peru
Don't leave ?Delhi, you're any guru?
I don't like work and I don't like you"
"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you fourpence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"
"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you fourpence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"

They're all just suicides, in a social way.
I'll never need that dormant time, I'll tell you why.
'Cause I think about it all the time,
I think about ?
I am ?
Sensory ? you
Sensory ? you
I don't know why, trust me,
It's bleeding me,
I don't know why, God, it's social suicide.
Sensory overload, what a hell of a time.
Gotta sensory overload, gotta free your little mind,
Free your little mi-i-mind.
Oh!
Go!
'Cause I think about ?
I think about ?
Think about playing these games for real.
I want to write down all the things I feel.
Don't want to hide from the things I hear.
I don't know why, trust me,
Oh God it's bleeding me,
I don't know, God, it's social suicide.
Sensory overload, what a hell of a time.
Gotta sensory overload, gotta free your mind,
Free your little mi-i-mind, your little

I've heard about a great big swindle
I read about it in a book
The book flew out the window
Was later found by thieves and crooks
And now
they're singing hallelujah
I'm wondering just what did they find
They say "what's it to ya?"
Just take a place in line
And wait
So I wait
I wait
And wait
And I
I'm one of a few survivors
I'm a drawer labelled "lost and found"
Moon travelers and deep sea divers
Whose oxygen supply ran out
Now maybe if their gods be willing
They'll give us something, fill our empty cups
Sit down in the boat, don't spill it
Or we'll just have to line back up
And wait
So we wait
We wait
Yes we wait
And we wait
And we wait
We will wait
'Til we
You can hear it in the beat they march to
And you can feel the earth shake when they start to dance
You can tell by the way they move you
It's not murder, it's an act of faith, baby
And as the world moves faster
Whip lashing us round and round
It's quite a slow disaster
But people keep on falling down
As they wait
We wait
And we wait
We wait
Hallelujah!

We are soul children.
Children of many colors.
Walkin' on a big black street
We all want different things.
We are soul children
Children of Freedom.
Children of rock and roll.
Children of confusion.
[Chorus]
We are running faster, reaching higher
Burning in the sun.
We are reaching farther but we have lost our
Soul Children
We are soul children.
Yes I'm a brother, yes I do believe.
We are soul children.
We must rise up from the deep.
We are soul children, try to feed our families and keep
Our mind free.
We are soul children, looking for a leader who'll do
Everything for 'me'.
[Chorus]

I'm gonna do this right girl
And then I'll hold you tight girl
Till then, I gonna wait, anticipate that day
I'm waiting for the right time, when you'll be mine
You say that you love me, I'm still gonna say
Girl you are the reason I wait
And when comes the season I know
I'm gonna give you the best girl
You tug at the strings of my heart
Sometimes I could break them apart
But if we wait till later, it'll be better
I'm gonna honour your body any way I can now baby
'Cause you belong to somebody and that someone is G.O.D

I caught you cryin'
Tryin' to hide your tears away
And all the while
I never knew you felt this way
I've loved you from the start
How could we let this come apart?
We've got to put
The sun back in our hearts
Through the alleyways
The avenues and dreary days
Your schoolyard eyes
Hypnotizing every time
When we kiss in the dark
Emotion tearing us apart
We've got to put
The sun back in our hearts
Down the cinder path
And through the hedge
Climbing up to the window ledge
Throwing lockets to make a scene
I can't explain, you know what I mean
I caught you cryin'
Tryin' to hide your tears away
But your crippled smile
Will always give the game away
Are we fallin' apart?
Are we just walkin' in the park?
We've got to put
The sun back in our hearts

I think the whole world should look good
That's important to me
Everyone should look good
And when they die they should die with their boots on
And their hearts on fire
When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld
I think the whole world should be funny
That's important to me
If you can't be funny don't be ugly
When they speak they should speak with their hands firmly on their hearts
When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld
I like to see people happy
Singing on the way to work
Children and animals happy
When they laugh they should laugh like us
Not like other creatures do
When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld

When you and I are ready
No longer earthly bound
We'll travel through
The crystal night, starbound
Heaven holds a mystery
Wrapped inside a sound
Through the eyes of endless times
Starbound, you and I
A floating star is what we are
Suspended in space
An outward bound, it's the
Only home we've found
To save the human race
Speed is now their captain
Kings that lost their crown
Motion is our master
Starbound, starbound
Starbound

We got lost again
Drove to the end of the road
And a red-faced man
Taught us to do what we're told
And on the twenty-third night
Things ain't bad but things ain't right
Are we falling or flying?
Are we falling or flying?
Are we living or dying?
I guess we'll never know
The air's so heavy
It could drown a butterfly if it flew too high
And I get the feeling
That the truck driver ain't shy
?'cause he's looking at me
But nowhere near my eyes
And on the thirty-fifth morning
Things ain't good but things ain't boring, no
Are we falling or flying?
Are we falling or flying?
Are we living or dying?
I guess we'll never know
Striking rock but hitting gold
Sometimes it's hard to tell
If there's a life behind this song
But I know tomorrow
Today won't feel so long, no
?'cause on the forty-second night
The room was dark but the stage was bright
Are we falling or flying?
Are we falling or flying?
Are we living? Are we dying?
?'cause, my friend, this too shall pass
So play every show like it's your last

Wait
It isn't so great
Since you learned Karate chop
You're walking machs
And I'm just swimming in the slop
You wave your wand at me
And make me dance flip-flop
I want to sing for you
And make your head go pop
The Inuit man
Had not so much a Caesar
He had provision
Say
You're spraying in the windy
And I'm just pissing off
I'm literally deaf down here
From your canned philosoph
Softly can you hear me
Through the sucking of your quaff
I'm Thallasocracy
And you're just Romanov
The Inuit man
Had not so much a Caesar
He had provision

Amber circles stretch astonishing
Silencing glassy water where we've never been
Backwards
Shining waves within each other spin
No one sees them
On the rocks the feeling's sinking in
Reckless
I wanna weep
I wanna run
I wanna stop the sun from setting
oh, don't let it go
Take this kiss I'm blowing through this dream
Silently
All alone you find out what it means
Oh love
I wanna weep
I wanna run
I wanna stop the sun from setting
oh, don't let it go
I wanna spin
I wanna whirl
I wanna stop the world from getting cold
Don't let it go
Baby, It's alright
I will not forget
We'll close it down
We'll come back
I will not forget
I will not forget
While I trace another full moon
Moving us backwards
Still the night
If I could change this restless blindside longing,
Wouldn't I?
Oh I would
I wanna weep
I wanna run
I wanna stop the sun from setting
oh, don't let it go
I wanna spin
I wanna whirl
I wanna stop the world from getting cold
Don't let it go

I heard he dabbled in the witchcraft
I heard occult
Oh they're pretty much the same
I guess he was adopted
Or raised by wolves
That's ridiculous to say
I heard he pulled over
Cursed the town
Had the touch so nothing grew
I heard that too is true
That's a lie, that's a lie
That's a lie, that's a lie
That's a lie, that's a lie
I heard he spoke in tongues
No crazy
I heard he was a refugee
I heard he was a monster
A scary ghost
Oh you know there's no such thing
I heard he pulled over
Cursed the town
Had the touch so nothing grew
I heard that too is true
That's a lie, that's a lie
That's a lie, that's a lie
That's a lie, that's a lie
We're left with some stories inert
But this is the part that will hurt
That nobody learned
And now nothing grows here
Always a silent remarkable man
Then one day he'd had it and threw up his hands
He filled up his lungs and he pulled at his hair
And he curled up his lips and he bellowed
You'll never know
how sorry you'll be
I heard he dabbled in the witchcraft
I heard occult
Oh they're pretty much the same
I guess he was adopted
Or raised by wolves
That's ridiculous to say

Always a silent remarkable men
Then one day he'd had it and threw up his hands
He filled up his lungs and he pulled at his hair
And he curled up his lips and he bellowed
You'll never know
how sorry you'll be
The looks on their faces you'd swear they were dead
It finally sunk into their bones when he said
Your seed will be bitter
The harvest will crumble
Your fields will lay fallow for years
And nothing will grow
People will speak of it once in a while
His legend would have it you'll hear it for miles
He'll curse up a blue streak and add to the air
A stink like a murder of bees
And nothing will grow

You know it's just a piece of ass
When girls are dying
It's all hype and selling news
While boys are lying
Close your mouth and shut your face
To keep from crying
Ask if it's a girl thing
Yeah, cause girls are dying
Yeah, another girl's gone missing
Sure don't know what you're missing
Bury some liberal in the ground
You never cared if she was found
How many deaths does it take to make you
Feel something too?
Girls are dying while men are lying
It's nothing to you
You don't wanna hear about it
Just something to do
Run your mouth all over town
Well, we don't need you
Say she's getting too much press
This time you have the wrong address
Even if her pockets lie
Don't mean she deserved to die
I can't believe it's true
That dead girls are old news
When bombs are falling
And you've been calling
Us girls have a right to know
Us girls have a right to care
When women die anywhere
Anywhere
You know it's just a piece of ass
When girls are dying
It's all hype and selling news
While boys are lying
Close your mouth and shut your face
To keep from crying
Ask if it's a girl thing
Yeah, cause girls are dying
Yeah, another girl's gone missing
Sure don't know what you're missing
Bury some liberal in the ground
You never cared if she was found

I enjoy your show and I've been trying
To get through for quite a while
Well, we're glad you kept trying
Umm, I have this problem, last July, I was assaulted sexually
And ever since then, I've been having trouble sleeping
How old are you?
I'm 22 going on 23
Medicine, counseling, anxiety, sleep programming
Medicine, sleep programming
Anxiety, counseling, medicine, sleep
Programming, depression, anxiety
Well, they told me, when I have these bad dreams
To try and put endings on the dreams like I come out a winner
But every time I try to do that, I just don't get anywhere
It seems, I keep having the same dream over and over every night
And that's why I'm up so late
And I watch one soap opera a day
And if he happens to walk in the house, I'm paranoid
I just jump up and turn off the TV
Except he says, "Is that all you're gonna do all day
Just sit around and watch TV?"

I remember sidewalk laughter down New Orleans, LA
A hot wet night at the fight with you
Had to push through the crowds and talk
Very loud it's true
But you were on my mind that day
You were on my mind each day
You were on my mind that day and forever
Had a drink, stop to think we had a few
Afterwards we went down to the dance side of town for the view
You went blushing inside and you pinched me to see
If I knew
But you were on my mind that day
You were on my mind each day
You were on my mind that day and forever, and forever
We were lovers then and forever
There was nothing that we couldn't do
A hot wet night at the fight with you
Times like that weekend remain in my heart crystal clear
Walking along to the song you have helped me to hear
Yes you were on my mind that day
You were on my mind each day
You were on my mind that day and forever, and forever

Started talking
To a couple of wedded strangers
Sitting down on motorcycles
Who passed on the highway
Stepped into
The service station
Took a piss, got water
Bought fuel to ride
Blood is flowing
And mountains are blurring
There is something stirring
Way down inside
Barely know
My home base home
Seems I'm rarely there
For any share of time
The neighborhood's the same
They all remember my name
Holding no reservations
The newness is wearing in
Checked my eyes to see if they had spokes
See if they are moving
See if they had spokes
See if there is somewhere else to ride
Barely know
My airbase home
Seems I'm rarely there
For any share of time
Before I ride

The parking lot sparkles hot
Around the busy sports complex
Crazy train, daisy chain
People just getting lazy, complaining
Arco Arena
Arco Arena

These four walls and late nights brooding
Never changing, never moving
It seems, it seems momentum's at a crawl
The ants are in the kitchen
The mice are in the walls
This noise in my head
Could make this building fall, yeah
I've got to get out of here
And I gotta get out, now, before I crack
Mac and cheese and minute rice
And instant pleasure's always nice
It seems, it seems
Real things take much too long
And I say now's the time to take a stand
And sit back down, hasty young man
Did you really think the world and all that it's offered
Could have done you so much wrong? Oh, yeah
I've got to get out of here
And I gotta get out, now, before I crack
South East, 101 forever
South East, 101 till I die
South East, 101 forever
South East, 101 till I die
I've got to get out of here
And I gotta get out, now, before I go
[Incomprehensible]

When the street's symphonies meet the last opposition
to the harmonies embedded in their sequenced affairs,
angels will scatter the land, fluttering, flying like moths to the flame.
Rising to march on the eastern plague, rising to march on the savages ways.
Fluttering, flying like moths to the flame.
Wait until tomorrow.

This time I'll take every word with a grain of salt and stare you down.
One day you'll learn what a promise really is and the meaning of pride.
Go ahead and X up.
Sellout.
Straight Edge for a while.
A crooked X for that crooked smile.
A new trend.
A new start.
The X on your hand will never be there in you heart.
I am Straight Edge.

Got the mike in my hand but can I make you understand
That a-hole bands have a-hole fans
Bloodhound's the name and the Gang's to blame
Like Chan n' Chin the Siamese twins it's one in the same
So fame ain't gonna live forever
Never worrying about dying cause it can't be any better
But whatever happens to happen always happens for the worst
And if the worst is yet to happen I hope it happens to you first
So hello Joe what do you know?
Heard ya just got back from a Bloodhound show
Did you do the Batussi or did you do the Hustle?
Did you do the Flamin' Waffle or the Super Bowl Shuffle?
No matter what you did you're gonna be amused
If you were not entertained you did not drink enough booze
If ya get your eyes a'fuzzin' then we'll get your ears a'buzzin'
Cause we play around the world you play around with your cousin
Bloodhound boys
Bloodhound girls
Bloodhound noise
Bloodhound world
Rock on rock on do it dusk til' dawn
Anywhere we go everywhere we've gone
Don't matter what town what state what show
Hell-bound Bloodhound going nowhere slow
We rock Philadelphia Baltimore Las Vegas Indianapolis
Louisville Atlanta New Orleans and Minneapolis
Houston Tucson Phoenix Buffalo
Tulsa Mobile Albuquerque Wichita and Orlando
Portland Salt Lake City Memphis Washington D.C.
Charlotte Oklahoma City Little Rock and Milwuakee
Cleveland Tampa Norfolk Dallas Raleigh Hartford Cincinnati
Boston Nashville Kansas City Chattanooga and Miami
Honolulu Richmond Austin Pittsburgh San Antonio
Baton Rouge and Anchorage and Birmingham and Toledo
Denver Detroit Dayton Spokane Fresno
And Jacksonville Colombus Springfield New York Sacramento
Los Angeles St. Paul St. Louis San Francisco
Madison Knoxville Seattle San Jose and San Diego
Jackson Omaha Des Moines Boise Providence Chicago
But no where in New Jersey that's the only place we won't go
Bloodhound boys
Bloodhound girls
Bloodhound noise
Bloodhound world
Rock on rock on do it dusk til' dawn
Anywhere we go everywhere we've gone
Don't matter what town what state what show
Hell-bound Bloodhound going nowhere slow

Gonna be some changes made
Man was a knife expert
Kinda of a Jim Bowie type,
Swaggerin', blusterin', 'coon skin
I said, "You're not serious, right?"
Then I saw him grab my friend by the hair
And I guess I should have prayed
As he dragged him around, I said to myself,
"There's gonna be some changes made"
(Gonna be some changes made)
Girl I knew and loved alone twenty years from afar
With a finger to her lips she led me out to see the stars
She led me down to the gritty lake and in it we did wade
She took my hand and put it there, gonna be some changes made
(Gonna be)
Gonna
Be some
Changes made
Gonna be some changes made!
(Gonna be some changes made)
[Chorus]
Gonna be some changes, changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
Gotta take it off, gotta get myself straight
Gonna be some changes, some changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Better figure out something
Things are looking grave
Gonna be some changes, changes, changes made
Up in front for all to see
Graceful like a bumblin' fool
Then I thought I felt slip from my mouth a little drool
Maybe no one noticed it
On my mind heavily it weighed
I saw two people snickering
I said "there needs to be some changes made"
Gonna be some, gonna be some changes made
(Gonna be)
Gonna
Be some
Changes made
Gonna be some changes made!
Gonna be some changes, changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
Some changes made
Going home, I've done enough to sow my little name
Going where the fields are green and I can do my macram
A buffoon fumblin' without a clue, who likes to shift the blame
And often feels betrayed
There's gonna be some changes made
There's gonna be some changes made
[Chorus: x2]
(Gonna be some changes made)
Gonna be some changes
Gonna be some changes

Get your fat ass off the acetate into
Down twen'y stairs
It came from the rest There,
goes to rest in the heart
"First I was a foreignerâ??"
Then suddenly "Everything (is) was cool forever"
This Western Oriental's going full circle
This Western Oriental's going full circle
Last number recall
Told me what you were up to
Put the volume down on adverts
To enthasis how sad they are
Mar ships sexier
And from all the above
This Western Oriental's going full circle
This Western Oriental's going full circle

Can't get a better offer
A string of shows won't stick
Good for us, the bones won't roll around
We're not the best supports, of what this represents
It could be fun, but damn the underground
I may be undercover, an observer looking in
I can play this part, do tell
Without any gift of skill
But the words aren't worth the time
Remind me what we're waiting for
How could you forget?
Cause it's an awkward phase I should be more accustom to
I'm not here to represent anything you get
This is our life, it was lost in the light
After the show is over, to office executive
But after that, I don't remember most of it
A view over the water and film locations, too
Think how far we've sunk when I'm not a decent drunk
It's a blur of drinks and lies
Remind me what we're waiting for
How could you forget?
Cause it's an awkward phase I should be more accustom to
I'm not here to represent anything you get
This is our life, it was lost in the light
I'm never alone
The fight that time can't find us
Remind me what we're waiting for
How could you forget?
This is our life
I'm not here to represent anything you get
Forget

Ain't none ever seen the face of his foe no
He ain't made of flesh & bone
He's the one who sits up close beside you
An when he's there you are alone
Every man is evil yes an every man is a liar
An unashamed with the wicked tongues sing
In the black soul choir
Yes an no man ever seen the face of my lord no
Not since he left his skin
He's the one you keep cold on the outside girl
He's at your door let him in
O I will forgive your wrongs
Yes I am able
An for my own I feel great shame
I would offer up a brick to the back of your head boy
If I were cain

And your smile, and the taste of your soda-pop.
And your frown, and the cut of your cheese.
And your voice, and the taste of your cigarettes.
Did you think, I'm in love with it all?

All of these words on paper
All of these thoughts in my head
The times I feel out of favor
The fear that sleeps in my bed
All of these stones in my pocket
My dreams that crashed on the shore
Faith when I thought I lost it
I lay it all at Your door
I bring it to You
There's wonder in all that You do
I bring You the scraps that make up my soul
You make me whole, I'm gold
I bring it to You
Songs I've shouted to heaven
The grace I've never deserved
All these gifts I've been given
The life that I find in Your word

I spend my days just mooning, so sad and blue, so sad and blue
I spend my nights just mooning, all over you (all over who?)
Oh I'm so full of love, as any fool can see
Cause ages up above, have hung the moon on me
(Why must you go) why must I go on mooning, so all alone (so all alone)
There would be no (there would be no) more mooning, if you would call me
(I've found a phone)
I'm lying by myself in bed, I cry and give myself the red eyeMooning over you
I'll stay behind (you'll stay behind) you mooning forevermore (forevermore)
Someday you'll find (someday we'll find) me mooning at your front door
(at my front door)Oh, everyday at school I want ya, always will until I got ya
Mooning too (there's a moon up tonight)

Well, my mom and papa told me they had some words to say
They said, "Get out", I said, "I'm leaving anyway"
I made some money playing this here guitar
Filled in a form and went and bought myself a car
I've got my cheque book, baby
Got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me, get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back
Well, I've been here for so long, sick of this whole town
Ain't getting younger and it's time I got around
Gotta go some places, I ain't never been before
When I turn that corner, mama, you won't see me no more
I've got my cheque book, baby
Got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me, get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back
Well, I've been here for so long, sick of this whole town
Ain't getting younger and it's time I got around
I gotta go some places, I ain't never been before
When I turn that corner, mama, you won't see me no more
I've got my cheque book, baby
I got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me, get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back

Never thought anything lasts forever
Hanging on every word
Hold the cards in tight
But your killing me with sincerity
And I'd make any move tonight
Redemption is a bitch
Too end on
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
All my training beget a traitor
A monster with a mind of it's own
The beast is poised to strike
The bastard plays on these insecurities
Takes all my will to fight
Redemption is a bitch
Too end on
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
Oh well,You know what they say
Suddenly everything's
Suddenly everything's real
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
(Oh well, You know what they say
Suddenly everything's
Suddenly everything's real)
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
(The bastard plays on these insecurities
Takes all my will fight)
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul
(Oh well,You know what they say
Suddenly everything's
Suddenly everything's real)
The dark night of the soul
The dark night of the soul

Long ago in days untold
Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I
Lived this life afore
Somehow I know now
Truths I must be sure
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Died
Lordy, Lordy, they died

Mickey's on the production line
I'm a super mouse in time
Everybody's doing the goose step out in anaheim
Mastermouse gonna feel no fear
Mickey's gonna lead us to the new frontier
Everybody wants to be the perfect mouseketeer
And there's stukas over disneyland
Stukas over disneyland
Stukas over disneyland
Stukas over disneyland
Jiminy cricket wrote a victory speech
With nottsberry farm right in reach
Our liebestraum has been extended to huntington beach
Turn on the gas and you're gonna see
How to achieve racial harmony
We need a perfect order that's our genetic destiny
Got an ss ticket I'm feeling fine
Spent five long hours just standing in line
Passed inspection got my ears on straight
Gonna fire up my engines 'fore it gets too late
I just can't wait

Now we have-
We've, uh, cleared
the Southern tip of
South America and
We're coming in-
on into Australia
and over New Zealand
and I have never seen-
incredible-
beauty-
One of the excavators
on the exploratory satellite
number 5-8-12.
It seems like, uh,
the people here
are really, really sad,
and I'm just sort of
confused right now.
It seems as if
some sort of devise
has detonated here.
There is a lot of confusion-
Absolutely no ambulances
at all on the area-
We somehow got
control of the transmitter.
Its just chaos everywhere.
We are nearing the Bearing Strait
right now
and we're coming in
over Denmark.
Its-
Its really beautiful up here.
There's really no
word to describe
the sensation of
outer space travel,
I'll tell you what.
There's really nothing like this-
I've really never seen
anything quite so beautiful.
I hope you're listening to me
and I wish you were here with me.
We're just coming over
the Soviet Union.
There's a large firey mass-
Hold on, its uh-
its unbelievable.
I uh- I hope everything's
okay down there...
I certainly do...
Its like a, uh-
I don't know-
Excavator on an
exploratory satellite
number 5-8-12.
Oh, seems like uh,
hello?
Control, are you there?
Seems like there's
no one out there-
like hello?
Hello?
Hey guys?
Is there anyone left?
My God!
It killed all of them.

You get a shiver in the dark,
It's a raining in the park but meantime-
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
Way on downsouth
Way on downsouth
London town
Check out guitar george, he knows-all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Savin' it up, for Friday night
With the Sultans
We're the Sultans of Swing
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans
Yeah the Sultans they play creole, creole
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
Goodnight, now it's time to go home
And he makes it fast with one more thing

It seems its been such a long time
Since I've been asking for
What did you said
Was this your valentine
(?)
To floor
It's been, it's been such a long time
Yes there are words for this
I see, my time has come
Can you rescue me
From this place I sit
From this place I be

I can't describe accurately how I feel inside
I know I just met you the other night
But I've never felt anything that just felt so right
I want you to
[Chorus:]
Take my lips and make them yours
Take my vision and let my heart soar
'Cause I've never felt like this before
So won't you
Take my lips and make them yours
I can feel your body next to mine
Every time I close my eyes
Every time I feel your breath on my skin
I can't wait to be with you again and again
So would you
[Chorus:]
And baby I, oh, I want to take your body
Your body so close to mine
And I, oh, I want to take your body
And make love that lasts for all time
For all time
And you know I want to make sweet love
Wanna make sweet love to you baby
So would you
[Chorus:]
Come on now, hey, say will you
Take my lips and make them yours

So, I'm feeling much worse now
You're better, you're better
Your designer drugs
Won't work, won't work for me
Connect to a three-volt
I hope your battery dies
How could you run
On such, such voltage?
All the same, I remain
The one you blame and I'm
Demonized, purified, justified
As you let yourself show
So now you'll love these screams
What's left of me
Don't speak
Love these screams
Like I do
My name
As the infinite stops cold
Just nine and the six are gone
Guess I was the one to ride, ride
Ride that dirty ride
That is turning so fast now
I think I cannot, cannot hold on
But at this pace
Who'd want, who'd want to
All the same I remain
The one you blame and I'm
Demonized, purified, justified
As you let yourself show
So now you'll love these screams
What's left of me
Don't speak
Love these screams
Like I do
My name
Don't ever speak my name
Don't ever speak my name again
Don't ever speak it
Don't ever speak my name again
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't ever my
Don't speak my name
So now you'll love these screams
What's left of me
Don't speak
Love these screams
Like I do
My name

Your love is extravagant
Your friendship, it is intimate
I feel like moving to the rhythm of Your grace
Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place
Your love is extravagant
[Chorus]
Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known You considered me a friend
Capture my heart again
Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend
Capture my heart again
Your love is extravagant
Your friendship, it is intimate

(6:49 a.m, Friday, November 20th)
"Good morning, Mr. Ben.
It's about 6:30
Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Um, just laying here in the bed,
Half awake, half asleep,
Thinking about you.
I was
Wondering if you were looking after your
Most valuable
Possession
Your mind.
I was thinking about
John Glenn,
His space journey and all.
They said that
When you're in space you lose
Muscle mass
And the body
Mass
And I wondered if there was any
End to it.
Or whether,
If you didn't exercise in space,
How long it would be before you were just
A head, or a mind,
And have no body or arms.
You'd have them but you couldn't use them.
I was wondering if
If your body mass would drop to a certain level,
And then it would stop right there.
And keep whatever you needed to
Use your mind
Because it would still be working."
(30 seconds remaining)
"Anyway, I was just pondering that.
What do you think about, that?
I hope everything is going alright.
I may well wake up here in a little while
And forget what I was thinking about."

Man without a rudder is ruled by the sea
Lost all anchors somewhere in the deep
Lover of machines-adrift in schemes
Cast his lot among rootless thieves
Nightlife swings in the gateway towns
but out here in the inches there's a ship going down
The sailor keeps swallowing siren smoke
Dreaming of a kiss, just beyond the choke.
These strange nights and days-
These numbers taking our names
Chorus:
Cool this madness down
Sop it right on time
Got one last chance better cool itdown
Before it takes our life
Man without bearings straggles in the wood
Counting on the wolf to forget about blood
Stacking up blocks for the god of numbers
Playing slow pitch with the angels of slumber
Now he is alone with the things he made
Shaking n the afterburn arcade
Games distract but they don't appease
What they attract they will not release
These strange nights and days-
These numbers taking out names
Chorus
Cool this madness down
Dance in a redemption town
Chant down desolation
Conscius movement come
Cool this madness down
(repeat)
Chorus

Compared to what you do
I've seen nothing of you
Compared to what you say
Your words just fall through the day
Idle words on their way
Compared to where you've been
And all these images you've seen
Compared to what you feel
You don't feel nothing that's real
Let the light you shine reveal
It's good to know that
You want me there
And I'd like to show that
You want me there
And we like to show that
We need you there
It's good to care
When you say the words
That we are longing to hear
When you get to see
What your loving does to me
Set my river running free
Compared to what you do
Comapared to what you do
The treasure that you bring
Makes my heart want to sing
All the things you do
Reflect this image deep in you
So let the love you've got shine through
It's good to know that
You want me there
And I'd like to show that
It's good to care
And it's good to know that
You want me there
And we'd like to show that
It's good to care

I talk to no one
Oh, you're invisible
And with this venomous tongue, yeah
None of it's true
And I can taste it
You see it's in the heavens
And merciful forever
And now I understand
Could I make me get over you
And you get over me?
Oh, could I make me get over you
And you get over me?
Aha, aha, aha, more, I just see you
Aha, more anymore, I just see you
This is the first day
I walk the rolling hills again
Where I can make plans
With pictures too
Tender trouble
It's almost lovable
I feel the weight of the trees
Beat on my chest
Could I make me get over you
And you get over me?
Yeah, could I make me get over you
And you get over me?
Aha, aha, aha, more, I just see you
Oh, more anymore, oh, I just see you
Feel bad, say so
Feel good, let it go
Feel bad, say so
Feel good, let it go
Aha, aha, aha, more, I just see you
Aha, aha, aha, more, oh, I just see you

At night they would go walking 'till the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping
Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
So we rode down to the river, where the toiling ghosts spring
For their curses to be broken
We'd go underneath the arches, where the witches are in the saying
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean
Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries in London
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open
Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
Singing la lalalalala la la
There's no light over London today.

Intro:
Well, it's your life.
Verse 1:
Yea, you may have your reasons, and you may have your lies.
But one day you will start to see that living isn't just to die.
Take a sip of what you're given, cause it might save your life
All the precious words were spoken out
For them to Save Me!
Chorus:
Save a friend, won't you come tonight
Don't say to yourself, "You're all that matters, now."
Verse 2:
He's the one who built His Kingdom
Not a soul was meant to die.
But you will be the one to say, "You're waiting for His Son to rise."
When the day arrives for righteous, He'll take away the filth.
And you'll join then in the suffering, long tonight!

Well, if you think about it
Then you're a fool, yeah
It's just a size and the mind that won't give you up
And if I think about it
Well, am I cool yet?
'Cause it's the word of the knife that won't cut you up
And if we think about it
Well, is it true yet?
'Cause there's no line that reminds whether we are enough
So let's think about it
Well, are we through yet?
It's just the crime at the time of a masculine hug
'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love
When we speak about it (made the right, always on mine)
And if I speak about it (erase the lies, love is frozen)
So if you think about it
What would you do?
You're just the man with the plan saying we are not lost
So let's think about it
Are we through yet?
It's just the time to decide if we can move up, up, up, up
'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love
Well, if you think about it
Then you're a fool, yeah
'Cause you decide to believe in what we made up
And if I think about it
Am I cool yet?
'Cause there's no lie like that lie that made us give up

Ooh I can make ya rock it
Oh I can make ya drop it
Rock it Drop it pop it don't stop it
In the club tonight
Chorus
Keep it going just don't stop
'Cuz you know what it takes
What'll make me drop
Down to the ground
And shake it all around
You keep it going get right down
(GET RIGHT DOWN)
I know what'll make ya
Or maybe break ya
I gotta shake ya
Just for the fun
Make it don't break it I know
you're gonna shake it
Whoa oh oh YEAH
(Chorusx2)
I need you
You need me
I'm having fun why can't you see
What you need to do to make me
ALRIGHT
(Chorus)
Keep it Keep it keep it keep it
Goin all night long

As I sit here watchin' the sun come up
Through the back window of my pickup truck
I recall how it used to be
Cruisin' the town all night long
With a couple of beers and a radio song
My best friend and me
Just my best friend and me
My best friend to me was more like a brother
I'd run around with him more than any other
Where you saw one, you saw the other
Just a sittin' around or runnin' for cover
That's the way that it used to be
With my best friend and me
Well, there never was much goin' on
But it beats the hell out of staying home
Mama said, "You're headin' for trouble, boy, you wait and see"
But we would go in spite of hell or high water
Never had a worry, never had a dollar
My best friend and me
Oh, just my best friend and me
Well, my best friend to me was more like a brother
I'd run around with him more than any other
Where you saw one, you saw the other
Just a sittin' around or runnin' for cover
That's the way that it used to be
With my best friend and me
Well, my best friend to me was more like a brother
I'd run around with him more than any other
Where you saw one, you saw the other
Just a sittin' around or runnin' for cover
That's the way that it used to be
With my best friend and me
Oh, just my best friend and me

Right to left, left to right
Light to dark and dark to light
But who could care from here, my girl
At the still point of the moving world
The still point of the moving world
One in four and two in three
She to him and he to she
But who could care from here, my girl
At the still point of the moving world
The still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
The rain will shine, sun will fall
Laws are broken after all
But who could care from here my girl
At the still point of the moving world
The still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
The still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world
Still point of the moving world

I'll be the right hand
You'll be the left hand
You and me we make
A mariachi band
Standing on the corner
Waiting for the light
When you're around I
Always feel alright
From the Painted Desert
Over to Paris, France
I followed your pointed
Finger with my glance
And I've seen so much
More than I would see
If it was just me, just me
If it was just me, just me
Our first rehearsal
Was under a redwood tree
And you brought lyrics and you
Handed them to me
And you said here you are
The only one who can sing this
And I felt kissed and I wondered
If it was just me, just me
If it was just me, just me
Let's get this party started
Let's squeeze the lime
The mariachi life
Is really more than fine
You know I'll meet you
You know I'll be flyin' blind
At the appointed corner
At the appointed time
At the appointed corner
At the appointed time
What if it was just me, just me?

the saddest smile can fill my heart with lies
to laugh or cry, that's what it's all about
i just can't figure out
i said goodnight and hung up the phone
stayed up all night 'cause i knew you weren't alone
and all these memories will be my death
the smell of your presence has stained my bed
i used their love to compensate the lack of you, but it's too late
your pretty eyes, i'd give my life
good reason not to ask me out
so drink up and get me drunk and let it drag me all around

Give me this before
I slip,
Before I sink,
Because I think
I think I may have found
The short way down
Just give me something
Something?s cold and clear
The love spent here,
As I had feared,
Means nothing dear.
I pray to reason I?ll forget
I?ll trade what?s left
Just give me something
I?m the devout,
Praying just to
Get the blood out,
Bound by this flesh I own
I?m the devout,
Cutting just to
Get the blood out
Desecrate 'til we die alone
I will defy
The pulse, disguise
But please pretend
We?re still alive
If it gives you hope
I sung and drowned,
I?m taking the short way down
Just give me something
I?m the devout,
Praying just to
Get the blood out,
bound by this flesh I own
I?m the devout,
Cutting just to
Get the blood out.
Desecrate til we die alone
Give me something I can take,
Can take to make the memories fade,
Poison kiss, remember this,
I never was meant for this day
Give me something I can take,
Can take to make the memories fade,
Poison kiss, remember this,
I never was meant for this day
I?m the devout,
Praying just to
Get the blood out,
Bound by this flesh I own
I?m the devout,
Cutting just to
Get the blood out.
Desecrate til we die alone
Just give me something
I?m the devout,
Praying just to
Get the blood out,
Bound by this flesh I own
I?m the devout,
Cutting just to
Get the blood out.
Desecrate til we die alone
We die alone
We die alone

The gun is loaded when the glass is full
Down the hatch and the trigger's pulled
Off the wagon and back onto the stool
I know that when I stare into your eyes
I can see all the years of lies
Ghosts and demons you never exorcised
All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
And I'm in the crowd but I'm all alone
Oh Lord, I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
His fate was written on a neon sign
A DUI never changed his mind
He got hooked like a fish caught on a line
You never gave yourself a chance to shine
Your destination's a chalk outline
And when you get to the gates you'll be denied
All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
And I'm in the crowd but I'm all alone
Oh Lord, I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
The tide keeps pulling me down
I try to reach higher ground
I'll never give up and drown
Even though I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
Tears into wine
Tears into wine
Well, I'll just turn these tears into wine

Love has no body
I love you, you big dummy
No body has love
No body has love
Breathe deep
Breathe high
Breathe life
Don't breathe ah lie
I love you, you big dummy

we protest because
we're afraid of not feeling guilty
for wanting to buy into
the standard order of things
we yell and scream for a better way
confusion is chaos
such is life
my union of double standards
who draws the line
for the people
buy the people
i'm disgusted with myself
for being bought and feeling used
paid with the price of selfishness and convenience

Don't got no goatee
Don't got no tattoo
Don't got no nose ring
Don't wanna be like you
Check out these glasses
So I'll never be cool
Always get my assed kick
When I get to school
Don't worry about image
Don't got no attitude
I know I won't get laid
If I wont be like you!
Don't got no biceps
Don't got no pecks
But I'll read you under the table
With my thick specks
See I got these glasses
So they kick my ass
But I'll kick their asses
When I get to class
I got these glasses
So I can't wear shades
I'll kick their asses
I'll get good grades
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!
I can't get rid of the times
Can't stop the party line
Don't know what the scenes about
Don't tell me to mellow out!
Don't got no goatee
No fucking safety pin
No I ain't no junkee
Don't got no heroin
Don't got no styling lotion
Don't wanna live by the ocean
Just wanna be myself
All you poseurs go to hell!
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class
We must read
We must read
We must read
We must read
RRRREEEEAAAADDDD!
Somebody get me a book!

Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ooh
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Went uptown to see my cousin
Plays guitar, sounds like a chainsaw buzzin'
In the crowd, I see his mom and dad
I said hey, hey uncle, man your son is bad
But sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo
Across the street, a neon sign
All you can eat for a dollar ninety nine
Aww, that old stew is the baddest in the land
But a one dollar's worth was all that I could stand
Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo, aw
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo
Ooh
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo
Back uptown to see Marie
Nobody home, I opened the door with my key
I love you, Huey was the note I read
But there's a strange pair of shoes underneath the bed
Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Oh

He was ready for the big trip, he was moving to the city;
He had packed his prize possessions and gave away the rest.
He was almost doing ninety, the sky was blue, sun was shining.
All the shit, he left behind for the big world waiting there.
He was almost out of Leighton, when that phone truck didn't see him.
Hit the brake and slided sideways, he never had a chance.
Plastic flowers on the highway. Bits of glass for the machine to sweep away.
Had to pass it on my way to where I'z going. For the next few minutes, I drove a little slower.
Them, M.A.D.D. mothers couldn't help him. He was sober, it was Sunday. He was full of good home cooking when he crashed the savior's door.
Plastic flowers on the highway. A greasy spot on the asphalt for a while.
Every morning, new babies being born, who'll do the best they can to hang around a little while.
My community service had me working for the county
Cutting grass on the off-ramps and medians and such.
Every quarter mile or so, stands a brand new reminder
Another traffic death in town. Something new to cut around.
Crashed out on the highway. Plastic cross and a plastic bouquet.
Paramedics in the by-stander's gaze.
Plastic flowers on the highway. Bits of glass for the machine to sweep away.
Had to pass it on my way to where I'z going.
For the next few minutes I drove a little slower.

Hey you rotting in an alcoholic empty shell
Banging on the walls of your intoxicated mind
Do you ever wonder why you were left alone
As your heart grew colder and finally tourned to stone
Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Don't you ever dream of escaping
Pathetic oblivion
Forgotten hopes buried in your soul's lonely grave
Pathetic oblivion
Remember how you were before you locked your heart away
Did I punish you for dreaming?
Did I break your heart and leave you crying?
Don't you ever dream of escaping

One, two, three, four
Lately I have been frequenting bad houses
Places no respectable man would be seen
I hate myself for my weakness
My past sickens me
I tell myself I will not go
Even as I drive there
I hate myself for my weakness
My past sickens me

Oh yeah, yeah
Call all the slackers, as they hitch on the road
Call all the swingers every time they got one home
One day, can't find the reason
One day, to the right the wrong
Got no herd on the range, but there's love for my soul
Crawl inside me, slowly, and let's
Go let it go live it crazy
Sunny, sunny, why every time I don't know
I can't explain it
I know, I know it's the same thing
Something tells me I'll always carry that weight down
But I feel fine
Convoy to destination, wielding a steady blade
John la Conquer root, done saved us, done saved the day
Hey now, they're speaking sweetly
Hey now, they're screaming out
Lazybones on the bed, come in, come let it out
Crawl inside me, slowly, and let's
Go let it go live it crazy
Sunny, sunny, why every time I don't know
I can't explain it
I know, I know it's the same thing
Something tells me I'll always carry that weight oh yeah
Falling all over you in a special way
Open the door, give it your praise
For the one who listens when you're sleeping
I want to take you with me
Go let it go live it crazy
Sunny, sunny, why every time I don't know
I can't explain it
I know, I know it's the same thing
Something tells me I'll always carry that weight down
It's what they're saying
Go let it go live it crazy
I know, I know it's the same thing
But I feel fine
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Seen the lights go out Broadway
I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs
And left there long ago
They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
But we went right on with the show
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on Forty second street
They burned the churches down in Harlem
Like in that Spanish civil war
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
It always burned up there before
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the battery
The union went on strike
They never sailed at all
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
And blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea
You know those lights were bright on Broadway
That was so many years ago
Before we all lived here in Florida
Before the Mafia took over Mexico
There are not many who remember
They say a handful still survive
To tell the world about
The way the lights went out
And keep the memory alive

Make your decision now
Rely on no help from above
Living is luxury
I want everything you throw out
I'll do anything you want to
Please let me go with you
I'll wear the smile on your face
Big, black and beautiful
I want it, everything you throw out
There must be something you can do with out
'Cause I am as sure as I am
I couldn't care less
For what might go wrong
And I'm as happy as sin
In a fear shaken world
I pity the rhino
Down there it's becoming extinct
Killed for a love potion
Sad thing looking like a dead flower
I want it, everything that you throw out
'Cause I am as sure as I am
I couldn't care less
For what might go wrong
And I'm as happy as sin
In a fear shaken world
Don't want to be there
Don't want to be spared
I'll wear the smile on your face
I am as sure as I am
I couldn't care less
For what might go wrong
And I'm as happy as sin
In a fear shaken world, world,
Couldn't care less

Eagle flies across a flag
Bureaucracy is such a drag
Behold a pale horse tonight
The men in black are out of sight
She comes
He comes
We come
She comes
Across the oceans in my mind
Across the skies I left behind
A land of opportunity
A land to fill my destiny
Emigrate [x4]
I've been alone a long, long time
So what, I take what should be mine
I've searched the sea of empty eyes
And severed all my familiy ties
A mercenary feeds my soul
A plastic world, no getting old
A monkey wears the age-old crown
The other monkeys getting down
She comes
He comes
We come
She comes
Welcome
Emigrate [x4]
Walk through fear
Leave you, dear
Never wanted to create a tear
Walk through fear
If you dare
Emigrate [x5]

There is life in the blood of the lamb who was slain
There is power, there is power in His name
There is love pouring out of the wounds that were made
Pouring out, pouring over our shame
So praise the God who saves
Praise the God who bled
Praise the God who was nailed to a tree
And wore our sins upon His head
There is truth in His body, raised that third day
There is joy in a stone rolled away
There is hope pouring out of the tomb where He lay
Pouring out, pouring over the grave
So praise the God who saves
Praise the God who bled
Praise the God who was nailed to a tree
And wore our sins upon His head
For He lives that we too might live
And He loves that we might also love
And know the glory of God above
There is life in the blood of the lamb who was slain
There is power, there is power in His name
So praise the God who saves
Praise the God who bled
Praise the God who was nailed to a tree
And wore our sins
So praise the God who saves
And praise the God who bled
Praise the God who was nailed to a tree
And wore our sins upon His head

The nickel dropped
When I was on
My way beyond
The rubicon
What did I do
And the games that I could handle
None are ones worth a candle
What should I do
I'm a frightened, fickle person
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'
What should I do
Oooh, after all the folderoling hauling over coals stops
What will I do
Can't take a good day without a bad one
Don't feel just to smile until I had one
Where did I learn
I make a fuss about a little thing
Rhyme is losing to the riddling
Where's the turn
I don't want a home
by doing that home is
Where my habits have a habitat
Why give it term
Oooh, after all the folderoling, hauling over coals stops
What did I learn
I am likely to miss the main event
If I stop to cry and complain again
So I will keep a deliberate pace
Let the damn breeze dry my face
Ooooh mister wait until you see
What I'm gonna be
I've got a plan, a demand and it just began
And if you're right, you'll agree
Here's coming a better version of me
Here it comes a better version of me
Here it comes a better version of me

I lived in a place called Okfuskee
And I had a little girl in a holler tree
I said, little girl, it's plain to see
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
She said it's hard for me to see
How one little boy got so ugly
Yes my little girly that might be
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Way over yonder in the minor key
Way over yonder in the minor key
There ain't nobody that can sing like me
We walked down by the Buckeye Creek
To see the frog eat the goggle-eye bee
To hear the west wind whistle to the east
There ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Oh my little girly will you let me see
Way over yonder where the wind blows free
Nobody can see in our holler tree
And there ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Way over yonder in the minor key
Way over yonder in the minor key
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree
And laid it on the she and me
It stung lots worse than a hive of bees
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Now I have walked a long long ways
And I still look back to my Tanglewood days
I've led lots of girls since then to stray
Saying ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Way over yonder in the minor key
Way over yonder in the minor key
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

Rock on gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon
Dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud
Cry out
Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home.
Rock on ancient queen
Follow those who pale
In your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale
Well did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now, do you know how
Pickup the pieces and go home.
Well did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me
Is it over now, do you know how
Pickup the pieces and go home
Go home
Go home
Pale
Shadow
Of a woman
Black widow
Pale
Shadow
Of a dragon
Dust woman
Pale
Shadow
Of a woman
Black widow
Pale
Shadow
She's a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman

We run like it kills us to stay
If judge, I'd be nothing 'till the day that I stopped you
He's tried as these things might seem to anyone else
I wrote them down to document
My wealth is you
My wealth is you
Excessive city we can't afford to stay
But home to the same somehow safe now we can afford to leave
Transformation and tragedy needs conclusion
Our world marches to drums of death
You're my rest
Stories will sleep
Say goodnight to them
And know it's ending
Slow my mind
Silence the truth
Take my broken hands
Watch the world remain
The stories read of hospitals and alcohol
And empty households
The bars were steamed in honesty
While your retreat
Resisted me
The buildings fail on everything and everyone
Fed incoherent
Our time is now
We'll be there
You're my death
I'm your disease
Together we will bleed
devotedly conceive
La la la la
La la la la
Take my broken hands
Watch it all ending
We watch it all ending

Snow, cement and ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters
Tracking down the hours
But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no
Junk, angel, this closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription
For a brand new heart attack
But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no

What have you done, my little spark?
Cursing my name cause again I put you out
Falling apart, you tell yourself you are
Dreaming only of the ones who never dream of you
I'm your disappearing one
Vanish when the curtain's drawn
But I will come again, and you will let me in
And you'll see I never disappear for long
Into your room I stumble now
Too tired to cower, and it's too late to draw you out
And there you lie like a painting of Christ
Bleeding on the heads of the ones who nailed you down
I'm your disappearing one
Vanish when the curtain's drawn
But I will come again, and you will let me in
And you'll see I never disappear for long

All my dreams are haunting me
Nothing seems to be for real
Can people change this world around
Can people change my life to come
It's been too many nights of fear
It's been too many days not clear
Can you believe a word they say
Can you control the righteous way
I even out my life
I even try to fight my
War and peace
Goin' round and round
Year by year, am I the only one?!
So you think I'm doin' fine
Stealing things
That are not mine
Be careful what you do wish for
You end up losing even more
I even out my life
I even try to fight my
War and peace
Goin' round and round
Year by year, am I the only one?!
War and peace
Goin' round and round
Year by year, am I the only one?!
Feel bad for you, so sad for you
I'm so done with you, overcome all the
overnight sensations and my patience
creates my ghost, yeah my patience creates my
Many men have traveled far
To try it all over from the start
Who you are is what you get
There is nothing that you can reset
I even out my life
I even try to fight
You boys just can't resist
Resist what girls won't miss
War and peace
Goin' round and round
Year by year, am I the only one?!
Well I fight my
War and peace
Goin' round and round
Year by year, am I the only one?!

Repeat these words
After me
In all honesty
Repeat these words
After me
If you dare to believe this
Yourself
Am I vain? have I shame?
Are my thoughts of a man
Who can call himself sane?
Do I blame, all my pain
On the wickedness
I have arranged?
If I do, bring it down
Repeat these words
After me
In all honesty
Repeat these words
After me
If you dare to believe this
Yourself
Am I vain? have I shame?
Are my thoughts of a man
Who can call himself sane?
Is my fate, all the same
As the man who has
Walked the line straight
If it is, bring it down
And I, I must rely, my dear
And I, cannot deny, my dear
There will be a reckoning
Which was, is
And is to come
Repeat these words
After me
In all honesty
Repeat these words
After me
If you dare
To believe

Don't take me for no sunbeam
Don't take me for no sunbeam
No sunbeam no sunbeam
Another faction of
And no detection of
Another tax out of your life
Don't take me for no sunbeam
Don't take me for no sunbeam
No sunbeam no sunbeam
Cause I'm a crumb begging baghead baby yeah
Crumb begging baghead baby yeah
Bet you say that to all of the girls
All of the long lost wars
Any cause is worth dying for
What passing bells for those who die like cattle again and again and again and again
Now, don't take me for no sunbeam
Don't take me for no sunbeam
No sunbeam no sunbeam
I'm a crumb begging baghead baby yeah
A crumb begging baghead baby yeah
Bet you say that to all of the girls
If you ever smile
In the street, crocodiles
I doubt you'd ever smile again
Now, don't take me for no sunbeam
Don't take me for no sunbeam, no sunbeam, no sunbeam

Drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die
It's better to laugh than it is to cry
My cup runneth over with blood and not wine
The last was the flood, it's fire this time
I took a walk on the beach, no sand dunes just oil
Dead gulls and dead fish were trod underfoot
The sky was tinted with yellow and black
And the air smelt like Dachou today
The fields were littered with the dying and dead
Nothing grows here but decay!
The village bell tolls, a priest vomits blood
Another life's wasted away
Down in the square, the party goes on
The doomed sit down to their last feast
They gorge themselves on the recently deceased
The heat of the day, the foul smell of decay
As they wait:. For the inferno to be
UNLEASHED!
So drink and be merry for tomorrow we may die
It's better to laugh than it is to cry
Live for life's sake, don't let life pass you by
There's more worth living for than meets the eye
So drink and be merry for tomorrow we may die!

When you look to the past for life's long hidden meaning
For the dreams and the plans made in your youth
Does the thrill to achieve match the warm hidden feeling
That lies so still and lives in you
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child
You've found the place to walk the path you've chosen
You'll never miss the world you left behind
When life gives life, it's happiness unbroken
When you give love, it's love you'll find
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child

Gonna paint a picture
Gonna put it in a frame
So I can show you how I'm feeling
Without having to explain
And you can hang it from your ceiling
In your safe and happy home
When you come to understand it
You'll know you're not alone
Once upon a time
We could speak our minds
Now I don't believe you Gwendolyn
I don't believe you're all that strong
I don't believe you know the dangers
Of this road you're travelin' on
You're always asking questions
That you know the answers to
Tell me please
What do you want from me
Gonna write a song
Gonna tell it like it is
And if you recognize yourself
I know yoou're going to be pissed
And if you call me on it
I'll deny it through and through
Just like Woody Allen would
If he were in my shoes
Once upon a time
I could speak my mind
Now I don't believe you Gwendolyn
I don't believe you're all that strong
I don't believe you know the dangers
Of this road you're travelin' on
You're always asking questions
That you know the answers to
Tell me please
What do you want from me
Gonna write a letter
Gonna a mail it to myself
Sincerely and forever
You and yours can go to hell
And I'll put it in my pocket
So when this all comes crashin' down
I'll have a way to show you
How long I've been wearing down
Once upon a time
We could speak our minds
Now I don't believe you Gwendolyn
I don't believe you're all that strong
I don't believe you know the dangers
Of this road you're travelin'
You're always asking questions
That you know the answers to
Tell me please
What do you want from me
Tell me please
What do you want from me
Tell me please
What do you want from me

Well I know somebody somewhere is gonna
Love me!
Well I know somebody somewhere out there is gonna
Hate me!
Well I'm loved and I'm hated
And loved and hated
And loved and hated
And love love love to be hated!
Well I know somebody somewhere is gonna
Make me feel alright!
Well I know somebody somewhere is gonna
Piss me off tonight!
Well I know somebody somewhere is gonna
want to fuck me!
Well I know somebody somewhere is gonna
Try to hurt me!

This behaviour's got to go,
But still we give them no,
Reason to aspire to something more,
Some people try to hurt you,
'Cos they only learnt that,
You get what you want using war.
It's gonna work, you got it all planned out,
Not gonna use it, you just gonna shout,
It's easy money and you got no doubts,
Victimless crime, straight in, straight out.
He says no,
Despite threats he's holding on,
He says no,
You know that you ain't got long,
He lets go,
But now you can hear the alarm,
Who'd have thought you'd do so much harm?
This behaviour's got to go,
But still we give them no,
Reason to aspire to something more,
Some people try to hurt you,
'Cos they only learnt that,
You get what you want using war.
I see the fear now in your eyes,
But it's fear for yourself, not fear for his life,
You don't feel bad about what you've done,
Your twisted idea of twisted fun.
How far can,
This go?
Before we admit that...
We Have A Problem And Money Can't Fix It........
This behaviour's got to go,
But still we give them no,
Reason to aspire to something more,
Some people try to hurt you,
'Cos they only learnt that,
You get what you want using war.
This Behaviour Has To Go.

I bet you'd never come down
From your tower for me
I'll let you take it real slow
While I try to decide
Never would've loved you
Should've left this town
Never would've loved you
But everything got turned around
It's nothing much but the same drug
It's nothing much but the same drug
Everyday
It's nothing much but the same drug
You threw it away
But I gave love away
She didn't come from the same world
See the same things, I can't deny
I bled on stages to get here, sent screams
Up to the sky
Never would've loved you
Should've left this town
Never would've loved you
But everything got turned around
It's nothing much but the same drug
It's nothing much but the same drug
Everyday
It's nothing much but the same drug
You threw it away
But I gave love away
She did it all the way
Now she's gone today
I can't sleep without her

God is on top of it all
And that's all it is
We are praying.
Athena, Athena
Athena, Athena

This one goes out to the world changer
Shining your light in the face of danger
Oh, tell us what you know
You're a saint, you're a son, you're a promise keeper
Bottom of the well, still digging down deeper
Oh, how far you gonna go
Chasing down hope
Moving on dreams
Taking that path
Maybe it'll lead you home
Maybe it won't
Nobody knows why your heart is broken
Nobody cries while your prayers are going up
But Love does
Nobody walks on the road you're paving
Nobody sees all the souls you're saving
Oh, but Love does
Love does
Love does
This is for the one on the front line fighting
Ringing that bell over everybody
Oh, tell us what you know
Knocking down doors in the midnight alley
Looking for a life in a desert valley
Oh, how far you gonna go
Chasing down hope
Moving on dreams
Taking that path
Maybe it'll lead you home
Maybe it don't
You are a renegade
You're an outlaw of Love's crusade
And they don't know who you are
They don't know
They don't know
But Love does
I'm telling you, Love does
Somebody knows
Somebody cries
Somebody feels
Love does
Somebody walks
Somebody sees
Somebody knows
Love does

Leather and sweat fills the atmosphere
Stretchin and drippin just to pogo too
The anarchy show they shout it out
There s no real music And I'm just shoutin and screamin'
But that s a response to an anarchist meeting
But after the gig is my true bender
Every shake back to me goes
Poor lambs this is a fuckin slaughter
You think that this is a turn of phrase
Realism is what we're preachin
Are you really so afraid?

Well there is no such thing as you
It doesn't matter what you do
The more you try to qualify
The more it all will pass you by
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
Well the more you try to shave the cat
The more the thing will bite and scratch
Its best I think to leave its fur
And to listen to its silky purr
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
Well there is no such thing as you
It doesn't matter what you do
The more you try to qualify
The more it all will pass you by
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is

Baby light a couple candles
Lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music
Throw a blanket on the floor
Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I want to be your man
It hit me just this morning
When I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you lookin'
Like you don't know me at all
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I want to be your man
And I will always be your cover when you're cold
And when the world lines up against you
I'm the safe place you can go
But now and then we need to find some time
To be in love, just be in love
Now the whole world's in bed sleeping
I think we're finally alone
And if the telephone starts ringing
We'll pretend like we're not home
'Cause any fool would understand
That all week I've been your husband
Tonight I want to be your man

Once upon a time is how it always goes
But I'll make it brief
What was started out with such excitement
Now I'd gladly end with relief
In what now has become a familiar motif:
That nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage--
Determined to lose it all
Critics at their worst could never criticize
The way that you do
No, there's no one else, I find,
To undermine or dash a hope
Quite like you
And you do it so casually, too
Cause nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage--
Determined to lose it all
Ladies and gentlemen--
Here's exhibit a
Didn't I try again?
And did the effort pay?
Wouldn't a smarter man
Simply walk away?
It doesn't really help that you can never say
What you're looking for
But you'll know it when you hear it,
Know it when you see it walk through the door
So you say--
So you've said many times before
But nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage--
Determined to lose it all

Shootin' stars, gilded age
Yeah, just spill your dreams to me and we just hide away
You can stay if you believe
Just a leap of faith across a busy boulevard of broken dreams
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
Yeah, I would ride into the sunset if I could
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
So slow to fade
Check all the hip across the street
Taking turns unlocking doors to fame by proximity
Golden dreams flow like water
And the water always wins for good or bad once you let it in
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
Yeah, I would ride into the sunset if I could
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
So slow to fade
Don't you cry on Oscar night
Lifted off from mother earth to find her elusive smile
You can't buy authentic vibe
But you can check out all the detours off the 405
But you can stay if you believe
But spinning gold is never easy when shooting stars are your dreams
Up in the sky a star's just a star
But funny thing when looking up it seems to follow you wherever you are
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
Yeah, I would ride into the sunset if I could
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
Yeah, I would ride into the sun like Clint Eastwood
Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood, Miss Hollywood
So slow to fade, so slow to fade, so slow to fade
So slow to fade, so slow to fade

Another exit on the freeway
Another bridge I cannot bear to cross alone
And I've been on the mend
I've been getting ready to change my name again
And once I had a love so fair
Once I had a reason to keep on
Left a paragraph taped up on my door
It said don't wait up 'cause I ain't comin' home
So I've been driving far and wide to find my call in life
Been looking for a place where I belong
I guess a little pain never killed anyone
I guess I feel that way again
I can't come clean, I cannot stay
Got no reason to explain
I've been here too long, I need a change
And I hope you'll understand
Stained glass window never gonna carry my name
Been laid to rest in a field of sticks and stones
And above my head all that's left are footsteps
Of some kid too young too far away from home
So don't send me invitations to your big parade
Place of residence unknownIn my eyes there is no compromise
There is no calm before the storm
These things happen all the time
Should I throw myself from the hanging tree'
Is there a place for those of us who don't belong' I haven't found it yet

You make sure you never lose
You only want to win
You use your head to find new
Ways to make people give in
Taking what they have
Becoming a good friend
But now that they have seen the light
You'll come to your end
Never giving nothing, Always giving a lie
Never giving nothing, People sussed your sly
You always take without giving
You've never heard of honesty
Times are hard for everyone else
But you can't bloody see
People queuing at your door
Begging for some food
You just slam the door on them
And tell them to get screwed
Spending money you have saved
Working all your life
Give it to the people
Who control boring life
Living without living
Fashion you must change
To be in with the in-crowd
Who live their life the same
Fashion you must change
To keep up with the trend
The money you are saving
Is coming to an end
People, they will follow
The changing of the trend
The fashion they have chosen
Will create a financial friend
Six months, they have passed
Another fashion comes
Work some boring overtime
To help the financial friend
You'll never have the authority
To be in charge of me
So don't give me your orders
Or your boring commentary
Just because you think
You're of a so called better breed
You seem to think that you're so special
But you don't fucking own me
Use me to make money
In your shitty factories
And I'll have to live and suffer
On a pathetic salary
Don't you look outside your window
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
People stare and you don't know
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
You watch people come as they go
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
Tally on and nowhere to go
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
The end is nigh or so they reckon
It's cold outside
It's cold outside
What's that flash on the horizon?
I don't know
I don't know
They're only going through a phase
Kids are all the same
They don't know their own right minds
It's only a silly game
They don't know what their talking about
They just talk a load of shit
If we just ignore them
They'll forget about it
Parental love is just a farce
Don't be taken for a ride
We know you're only young
But feel free to speak your mind
Do not work and do not pray
Ignore the bores at school
Live your life your own way
Don't be nobody's fool
Counteract the system
Youngsters are the best
Counteract the system
Become a real pest
Politicians one after one
Creating havoc and having fun
Pulling our lives to bits and pieces
Sucking and crawling like common leeches
Vote for me, I'm SDP
No vote labor, no vote Tory
You don't know which one to choose
It doesn't matter, you'll always lose
You're just a load of pointless bastards;
You haven't got a brain
You're just a load of pointless bastards;
You're driving me insane
What makes people vote 'em in
I can't see the reason
There's no justice in the lot of 'em
They're all just legalized treason
Police harassment on our streets
Nuclear war at our feet
Unemployment up again
It's just for their financial gain
Don't want to be your fucking hero
Don't want to be your fucking star
They use your money and exploit your name
Using people is the name of the game
They say wear bondage and a messy suit
You're just another dumb recruit
Don't know what we're gonna do
We just can't get through to you
They take your money; You work so hard
But you'll just get an unemployment card
In the day, you're just a lad
You're a poser, it ain't so bad
I ain't a poser or a fucking star
I don't drive a flash fucking car
Chaos in society, you're to blame
In years to come, it'll be the same
The glueheads walk with spaced out heads
Their eyes are open wide
The zombie walk that they have learnt
Has now got to their minds
They save to buy a pot of glue
They know it rots their souls
But now they find this very filling
And decide to sniff it all
The glueheads walk with spaced out minds
Their heads shrink and grow
Addiction overweighs the choice; corrosion of the brain
A twentieth century label reading mentally insane
His head, it starts to shrink and grow
His brains are all confused
His body seems to float away
Although, it is diseased
Addiction overweighs the choice; corrosion of the brain
A twentieth century label reading mentally insane

So, I am in the twilight of my youth
Not that I'm going to remember
Have you seen the moon tonight, is it full?
Still burning it's embers
The people dancing in the corner
They seem happy, but I am sad
I am still dancing in the coma of the drinks I just had
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Take me to your house and I'll leave you alone
Of course I will, of course I won't
It seems so tragic, but it disappears like magic
Like magic
Like magic
Can you recommend an education or drugs
Because I'm bored with you already
I'm on Broadway and I think it's a parade
I'm covered in pieces of confetti
And I am in the twilight of my youth
Not that I'm going to remember
Dancing and slowly and finding the truth
And it covered in coma
All these people in my life, they seem so in love
Well, I am not
Memorizing my shoes in a cigarette shop
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
I'm kinda lonely, will you take me home?
Of course you will, of course you won't
Of course I'm crass, it seems so tragic
Of course you will, of course you won't
But I'll disappear, I'll disappear
Just like magic
Just like magic
Just like magic

Don't believe in everything that people try to tell you
And don't buy into everything the market tries to sell you
They have no clue what's good for you
When time is done and hope is gone
We'll still hold on to the truth
Join the fight to save your life
Don't leave it up to everybody else
Join the fight this is your time
You've got to use your mind to save your soul
Don't give into ads that try to tell you who to be
When what you are is obvious for everyone to see
Just take this step to be your self
When time is done and hope is gone
We'll still hold on to the truth
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I thought you were by my side
Before I had to run and hide
From the caring constabulary
They're there to protect you and me
How can you be justified
Making money from people's lives
We don't believe in what you say
You broke my arm/legs but that's O.K.
I got the fuck kicked out of me by constable care

I try to reach your outstretched hand. Oh why do I?
I try. I fail you.
I try to reach your outstretched hand. Oh why do I?
I try. I fail you.
Strike a match, for I deserve to burn
Light a match, for I deserve to burn
Light a match, for I deserve to burn
Light a match, for I deserve to burn
burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
I try to reach your outstretched hand. Oh why do I?
I try. I fail you.

The moon is down
Casting its shadow over the night-haunted town
Mystical figures under the silence of light
The trembling air
Drifts slowly unseen over the houses there
And echoes changing into the voices of night
On the edge of twilight whispering
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper,
On the edge of twilight whispering
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Elusive time
In limbo active in never ending mime
The edge of twilight into the darkness of day

Ah Kansas City
Going to get my baby back home
I'm going to Kansas City
Going to get my baby back home
Well its a long long time too
My baby's been gone
Ah, Kansas City
Going get my baby one time
I'm going to Kansas City
Going get my baby one time
Its a just a 1-2-3-4,
5-6-7-8-9

I can't read your semaphore
You're too far away
Your signal's fallen down
I can't trace you
Your outline has been erased now
I don't want to stand around here anymore
Mobile communication let me down again
It stands to reason we should be out here getting high
Instead of cracking up we could be seeing eye to eye
Mobile communication let me down again
I'm out here in the dark
Trying to connect, I need to reconnect
But these wishes on mechanical stars
Don't come true, they never seem to come true
I don't want to stand around here anymore

I go to work in a bubble
I got everything I need
I get so high on no trouble
It's a great feeling, being free
I say a prayer at thanksgiving
I bless the night and the day
I look up to the sky with a smile on my face
And I praise the lord of the new way
The sweetest sound I ever knew
Was the sound of reason falling
Like the summer rain
And the truth washed the pain away
New way
I don't watch tv anymore
Don't need to see it now we all know the score
And all the politicians know what they're there for
It's a new way
New way

Well I can remember
Like it was only yesterday
Love was young and foolish
Like a little child at play
But oh how love has changed
I never knew how easily
Now I'm just a shadow
Of the boy I used to be
Yeah yeah
And when I write the book
About my love
It will be about a man
Who was torn in half
By his hope and ambition
Wasted through the years
The man will be written
On every page in tears
When I write, When I write the book
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love
I was a fool to my self
When I kept on running around
I've been a little better
Oh when I tried settling down
Maybe some magic moment
You never know but not for long
But all too soon the magic
Was in a moment gone
And when I write the book
About my love
It will be a heart breaking story
About love and luck
And when I get down on the pages
All I have felt
It will make the hardest heart of the critics heart melt
When I write, When I write the book
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love
When I was young love was fun
I was so happy
I looked so good
And I dressed so happy
Two tone shoes on my feet
Big old smile on my face
As I moved, moved, grooved
All over the place
Now I'm down on my luck
And my complexion is bad
Because my love love life
Is sadder than sad
And when I write the book
About my love
It will be a hard publication
Tougher than tough
When I get down on the pages
All I've amassed
It will shoot to the top
Of the bestsellers list
When I write, When I write the book
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book
When I write the book about my love
When I write the book about my love

Someday my peace will come
Oh I know my peace will come
I will sleep like a child without pain - without fear
Like a smile in the afternoon sun
Oh someday my peace will come
Lord can you hear me - Oh I know you know my name
It's written in the tears - That flow from my pain
Broken hearted broken soul
All my life on the run
But someday Yeah someday
My peace will come
Someday my peace will come

I'm gonna wanna see myself with something too
Friends I don't pay for friends I never knew
So, I took a chance and got some help from few
And got a long and skinny friend to talk to
'Cause I had the time and the liberty
To play with my new pet Sally
Please don't go away Sally please
No more lonely showers and uneaten foods
My salamander has hygiene too
And he thinks of me the way I think of you
The only next step for him is to say I do
'Cause I had the time and the liberty
To play with my new pet Sally
P.O, I love you

[Take this... for a ride]
Down with the dc Talk, d- d- down with the dc Talk
Are you down with the dc Talk, d- d- down with the dc Talk
Pullin' out my big black book
Cause when I need a word defined that's where I look
So I move to the L's quick, fast, in a hurry
Threw on my specs, thought my vision was blurry
I looked again but to my dismay
It was black and white with no room for grey
Ya see, a big "V" stood beyond my word
And yo that's when it hit me, that luv is a verb
(chorus 1)
Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin' we can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout love in a different light
And if we all learn to love it would be just right
(chorus 2)
Hey, tell me haven't ya heard?
Luv, is a serious word
Hey, I think it's time ya learned
I don't care what they say
I don't care care what ya heard
The word luv, luv is a verb
Down with the dc Talk, d- d- down with the dc Talk
Are you down with the dc Talk, d- d- down with the dc Talk
Thinkin' of a way to explain-o
Cause ya' know when I'm flowin' like a bottle of Drain-o
Simple and plain, L-O-V-E
Ain't all that junk that ya see on TV
Put soaps on a rope cause they ain't worth copin' with
It's a myth that there ain't no hope and
Luv is enough if it's unconditionally
Givin' now you're living out the Great Commission
(repeat choruses 1 and 2)
Back in the day there was a man
Who stepped out of Heaven and he walked the land
He delivered to the people an eternal choice
With a heart full of luv and the truth in His voice
Gave up His life so that we may live
How much more luv could the Son of God give?
Here is the example that we oughtta be matchin'
Cause luv is a word that requires some action
(repeat chorus 1)
(repeat chorus 2 x4)

So you've done wrong, a stab in the back
You were out of control, that was what you lacked
So you've calmed down, and then you start to cry
Sympathy from me, you won't get mine
It was way uncalled for and now you realize
Nope, too late, it's done
There's no compromise.

When the sun goes down
And the freaks come out
And I'm waiting in this messed up town
Hesitating, is it too late now?
Well this ones for the broken-hearted
Red lights on an empty street
Thinking tonight, it's just you and me
And we just might make some history
Well, shut up and let's get it started
Now we're gonna live it up
'Cause we don't gotta know anyone
To have some fun
There's no generation like our generation now
Gutted when the sun comes up
'Cause you make me wanna fall in love
Or take some drugs
There's no generation like our generation now
Well we talk 'bout now and we're all strung out
Going crazy in this fucked up town
And I'm hazy, yeah I'm coming down
And believe me I'm just getting started
Listen, let the music play
While we're kissing, every night away
And we're wishing it'll stay this way
This one's for our dear departed
Now we're gonna live it up
'Cause we don't gotta know anyone
To have some fun
There's no generation like our generation now
Gutted when the sun comes up
'Cause you make me wanna fall in love
Or take some drugs
There's no generation like our generation now
No generation like our generation
There's no generation like our generation
There's no generation like our generation
There's no generation like our generation
Now we're gonna live it up
'Cause we don't gotta know anyone
To have some fun
There's no generation like our generation now
Gutted when the sun comes up
'Cause you make me wanna fall in love
Or take some drugs
There's no generation like our generation now
(woah) Like our generation
(woah) Like our generation
(woah) Like our generation
There's no generation like our generation now
(woah) Like our generation
There's no generation like our generation
There's no generation like our generation
There's no generation like our generation now

I took off
When will will make no way steal it
Like I found speed on the mic
I can't shut up
We're street illegal
Red hot
In ports
Swinger
The thoughts of scene a crime
Steal and all race out of my mind
I give up
We reckless op'ed
And in a hot import
Now words I'll always say
Since I found speed on the mic
I can't shut up
To girls that love to haunt
The U.S. is made
To streak her letterman
Back and forth

We are building a religion
We are building it bigger
We are widening the corridors
And adding more lanes
We are building a religion
A limited edition
We are now accepting callers
For these pendant key chains
To resist it is useless
It is useless to resist it
His cigarette is burning
But he never seems to ash
He is grooming his poodle
He is living comfort eagle
You can meet at his location
But you'd better come with cash
Now his hat is on backwards
He can show you his tattoos
He is in the music business
He is calling you "DUDE!"
Now today is tomorrow
And tomorrow today
And yesterday is weaving in and out
And the fluffy white lines
That the airplane leaves behind
Are drifting right in front
Of the waning of the moon
He is handling the money
He is serving the food
He knows about your party
He is calling you "DUDE!"
Now do you believe
In the one big sign
The double wide shine
On the boot heels of your prime
Doesn't matter if you're skinny
Doesn't matter if you're fat
You can dress up like a sultan
In your onion head hat
We are building a religion
We are making a brand
We're the only ones to turn to
When your castles turn to sand
Take a bite of this apple
Mr. corporate events
Take a walk through the jungle
Of cardboard shanties and tents
Some people drink Pepsi
Some people drink Coke
The wacky morning DJ
Says democracy's a joke
He says now do you believe
In the one big song
He's now accepting callers
Who would like to sing along
He says, do you believe
In the one true edge
By fastening your safety belts
And stepping towards the ledge
He is handling the money
He is serving the food
He is now accepting callers
He is calling me "DUDE!"
He says now do you believe
In the one big sign
The double wide shine
On the boot heels of your prime
There's no need to ask directions
If you ever lose your mind
We're behind you
We're behind you
And let us please remind you
We can send a car to find you
If you ever lose your way
We are building a religion
We are building it bigger
We are building
A religion
A limited
Edition
We are now accepting callers
For these beautiful
Pendant key chains

I'm gnawing on the knowledge,
That I have been burned,
And I'm learning things that I should've already learned,
Everyone I already knew, wasn't kind and coy,
I was with a girl, but it felt like I was with a boy,
I can't even remember, if we were lovers, or if I just wanted to,
But I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you
I will not kill, the one thing that I love,
In this world of wreckage, I look above,
I said help me lord, help me understand,
What it means to be a boy, what it means to be a man
I can't even remember, if we were lovers, or if I just wanted to,
But I held her in my arms, I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you,
I'm gnawing on the knowledge that I have been burned,
And I'm learning things that I should've already learned
Everyone I ever knew, wasn't kind and coy,
I was with a girl, but it felt like I was with a boy,
I can't even remember, if we we're lovers, or if I just wanted to,
But I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you
I can't even remember, if we we're lovers, or if I just wanted to,
But I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms,
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you

Sensing that this is a dark day
I remember when the sun came again
No need to fight the world myself
I have victory built into history
Because I have seen better days
There will be better days
This is a shadow of life lying fallow
Despairing can't find it's place here
Take a token from the past
And you see that nothing lasts
Things keep moving on
And you ask me where is home
Well the clouds have fallen ill
And if yet more rain is spilled
Well, I forgive them
Wash your fears in purest hope
It keeps you cleaner than can soap
Just remember
That the dirt comes from within your living skin.
It's made of everything you eat
Keeps you standing on your feet
There's a price to pay,
But don't dismay,
You'll live.
Because I have seen better days
There will be better days
This is a shadow of life lying fallow
Despairing can't find it's place here
Fearing silence you just might
Find yourself awake at night
Imagining the things that could go wrong
Before too long.
Let the panic slip away,
Don't hold too tightly to this day
Don't crush its life out and
You're sure to find the cure
Sensing that this is a dark day
I remember when the sun came again
No need to fight the world myself
I have victory built into history
Because I have seen better days
There will be better days
This is a shadow of life lying fallow
Despairing can't find it's place here

I'm in tight with a demon called Deception
It's alright he's a treating me quite well
I'm in tight with a demon called Deception
He's right beside me when I fail
To whisper words like brother nothin' here is any good
See the birds they're a droppin' like a star Wormwood
And all I wanted was a little patch of green
We were peasants and the cotton was our king
And in the fields till I sing a prisoner's song
Well, Deception whistles right along
Right along
Charlie, sang for a pocket full of pills
While Deception, was a clickin' his high heels
We're in tight playin' seven one night stands
And Deception, made me as I am
As I am, as I am
As I am, as I am
I'm in tight, I'm in tight
I'm in tight
Truth is I'm in tight
I barely saw the light
Just as it kicked in
Something saved my skin
Something saved my skin

all alone again, the phone forgot to ring
even if it did, i doubt it would be for me
bedside table photographs of you, half smoked cigarettes
remember something too good to be true
and you called me and told me you were home
watching movies with your friends
while i sit by the phone i guess i'll have another cigarette
i guess i'll write another song
if i could be anything i'd be an aeroplane and then i'd fly so far away
500 miles so that you could look at me that way
the ceiling is so lonely when it's all that you can see
lying here on my back thinking of your smile
and the next time you'll show it to me
i can't help being jealous of your room when you're in it all alone
and i can't help being jealous of your friends when you're having fun
and i'm stuck here at home
i took the el today and everything reminded me of you
and i remember how you sat on the stairs
eating popsicles that turned your lips blue
i knew it then i know it now
my favorite dream has come true
i love you so much and i'll never meet another like you.

Pet sounds filling pet peeve void's
Black and white TV with the sound turned down
Is it mono or stereo?
Lending aneurysm satisfaction in the
Fruitless gaze of your Mona Lisa lazy smile
Trick ourselves in portable stanzas
Black Russian throated on this
Guillotine cancer
How steep we are
But there's just no telling
Just no telling
Savion is under heel clicking
Morse code through movie stills again
The sky had blackened with carrion birds
Pinstriped suits and cigarettes tapped danced
Through the tepid burlesque
Their mouths were parched with excess thirst
Bridge and chorus candy curse
Still they snag through the strep throat verse
Pet sounds filling pet peeve voids
Black and white TV with the sound turned down
Like breathing blood through lungs of czar's child

this is a formal apology for the behaviour of jesus bonehead. the poor old boy is drunk on power. these songs are getting to his head. jesus bonehead likes to pick up chicks in his favourite bar. he'll even take them home with him if they pretend he's a rock star. he's jesus bonehead and he's drunk on power.

Jump streams that cut across the bed
Leaving colours there instead
See lines I'm drawing to an end
But ignore them
And if I say how I feel again
Is it wise to do it?
All I'm hearing for the umpteenth time
The song I despise
And don't you fall asleep
There's lots of things I need to say
That just won't keep
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet catatonia
I should've told you
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet catatonia
I should've told you
And with my fears in the back of my mind
Will they gang up on me?
And when I least expect them to
Will they devour me?
Now don't you turn aside
Your tired ears must hear me out
There's nowhere to hide
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet catatonia
I should've told you
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet catatonia
I should've told you
And don't you turn aside
Your tired ears must hear me out
There's nowhere to hide
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet catatonia
I should've told you
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet catatonia
I should've told you
And with my fears in the back of my mind
Will they gang up on me?
And when I least expect them to
Will they devour me?

Fell off the edge of night there
It's raining all around, the storm is forming around
But still there's a calm inside me
Look left, look right, look straight now, focus on divinity
Knock once, knock twice, now crash through
Oh, oh, I need you, oh, oh, I want you
Look into my eyes, you're all you'll see inside
Oh, oh, I need you, oh, oh, I want you
There isn't any time I'm better off without you
And say my name, yeah, say my name
Fell off the edge of night there
Sometimes the mist falls perfectly
No words can form to meaning
Thankful thunder breaks the silence
One step in solitude downtown, Bloomfield avenue
Flash bright, flash light, this breaking light
Oh, oh, I need you, oh, oh, I want you
Look into my eyes, you're all you'll see inside
Oh, oh, I need you, oh, oh, I want you
There isn't any time I'm better off without you
And say my name, yeah, say my name
You are the one, you are the one for
You, you, you, you are the one for me
You are the one, you are the one for
You, you, you, you are the one for me
Oh, oh, I need you, oh, oh, I want you
Look into my eyes, you're all you'll see inside
Oh, oh, I need you, oh, oh, I want you
There isn't any time now, I'm better off without you
And say my name, yeah, say my name
You are the one, you are the one for
You, you, you, you are the one for me
You are the one, you are the one for
You, you, you, you are the one for me
You are the one, you are the one for
You, you, you, you are the one for me
You are the one, you are the one for
You, you, you, you are the one for me

It's a cruel, cruel world to face on your own
A heavy cross to carry along
The lights are on but everyone's gone
And it's cruel
It's a funny way to make ends meet
When the lights are out on every street
It feels alright but never complete
Without joy
I checked you
If it's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it
On the rainy nights, even the coldest days
You're moments ago but seconds away
The principal of nature, it's true but
It's a cruel world
We can play it safe or play it cool
Follow the leader or make up all the rules
Whatever you want, the choice is yours
So choose
I checked you
If it's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it
I trust you
It's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it
I checked you
If it's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it
I trust you

System, system, system - death in life
System, system, system - the surgeons knife
System, system, system - hacking at the cord
System, system, system - a child is born
Poor little fucker, poor little kid
Never asked for life, no she never did
Poor little baby, poor little mite
Crying out for food as her parents fight (x2)
System, system, system - send him to school
System, system, system - force him to crawl
System, system, system - teach him how to cheat
System, system, system - kick him off his feet
Poor little schoolboy, poor little lad
They'll pat him if he's good, beat him if he's bad
Poor little kiddy, poor little chap
They'll force feed his mind with their useless crap
Force feed his mind with their useless crap
System, system, system - they'll teach her how to cook
System, system, system - they'll teach her how to look
System, system, system - they'll teach her all the tricks
System, system, system - create another victim for their
greasy pricks
Poor little girly, poor little wench
Another little object to prod and pinch
Poor little sweety, poor little filly
They'll fuck her mind so they can fuck her silly
Fuck her mind so they can fuck her silly
System, system, system - he's grown to be a man
System, system, system - He's been taught to fit the plan
System, system, system - forty years of jobs
System, system, system - Pushing little buttons,
pulling little knobs
Poor fucking worker, poor little serf
Working like a mule for half of what he's worth
Poor fucking grafter, poor little gent
Working for the cash that he's already spent (x2)
He'll selling his life, she's his loyal wife
Timid as a mouse, she's got her little house
He's got his little car and they share the cocktail bar
She likes to cook his meals, you know, something that appeals
Sometimes he works til late so his supper has to wait
But she doesn't really mind cos he's getting overtime
He likes to put a bit away just for that rainy day
Cos every little counts when the cost of living mounts
They do the pools each week hoping for that lucky break
Then they'd take a trip abroad, do all the things they can't afford
She'd really like to have a fur, he'd like a bigger car
They could buy a bungalow, with a Georgian door for show
He might think of leaving work, but no, he wouldn't like to shirk
He'd much prefer to stay and get his honest days pay
He's got a life of work ahead, there's no rest for the dead
She's tried to make it nice, he's said thankyou once or twice
System, system, system - deprived of any hope
System, system, system - taught they couldn't cope
System, system, system - slaves right from the start
System, system, system - til death do them part
Poor little fuckers, what a sorry pair
Had their lives stolen, but they didn't really care
Poor little darlings, just your ordinary folks
Victims of the system and its cruel jokes (x2)
The couple views the wreckage and dreams of home sweet home
They'd almost paid their mortgage when the system dropped its bomb.

Oh, it's night again
And the dark just killed the sun
If the light must end
You've got time to run away
There's a door to dreams
And it always lets you in
But with a silent scream
All the nightmares must begin
Still you chase what you can't see
Like death and pain and sin
And the shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind
You'll remember me
I could make you disappear
Be where you want to be
Just as long as it's not here
Well, I'm back and stronger
And the first one's always free
And it lasts much longer
You can bet your sanity
'Never more', the victim cries
As I slip beneath the skin
Like the shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind
If words had names like red and green
And two for sympathy
Black and white and in between
Then you'd be misery
Every day is an inquisition
Who are you? What are you? Why?
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back
It's a half truth, still a whole lie
In the garden of good and evil
You'll know but you know
The spider only spins
The shadow of the wind
The shadow of the wind

Sometimes when I sleep I can see you walking back to me
And sometimes I wake up 'cause I swear I felt your touch
Then emotions overcome me
And the darkness is so cold
I light a candle, watch it burn
I feel the angels come and fill this room
When you're gone I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you, I pray for you
Every minute of the day I can clearly see your face
And every minute we're apart
Oh, you know it just breaks my heart
I'm so lonely, but I'm okay
'Cause I know we'll be together again
I light a candle, watch it burn
I feel the angels come and fill this room
When you're gone I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you, I pray for you
Oh, I pray for you
I light a candle, watch it burn
I feel the angels come and fill this room
When you're gone I miss you so much
I do the only thing I can do
I pray for you, I pray for you
Oh, I pray for you
Please hold her and protect her
'Til she's back here in my arms again
Oh and tell her how I love her
And I'll be waiting right here forever, Amen

She's upset
Bad day
Heads for the dresser drawer to
Drive her pain away
Nothing good can come of this.
She opens it there's nothing there
Its only left over tears
Mom and dad had no right she screams
The anger runs down both of her cheeks.
Then she closed her eyes
And found relief in a knife
The blood flows as she cries
All alone the way she feels
Left alone to deal with all the pain-drenched sorrow relief
Bite the lip just forget the bleeding
Then she closed her eyes
And found relief in a knife
The blood flows as she cries [x2]
Curled up she's on the floor
Relief left her she had hoped for something more
From it (hoped for something more)
From it
He leans down to comfort her
She is weeping and He
Wraps His arms around
And around and around and
The deeper you cut
The deeper I hurt
The deeper you cut
It only gets worse [x2]
Gets worse.
Now she's slowly opening... [x2]
New eyes...
She opened her eyes
And found relief in His life
And put down her knives.
She opened her life
And found relief through His eyes
And put down
She put down her knife.

Take my hand, discoman
Are you just a one night stand?
Have some fun, jump the gun
But what's left when it's all done
But who are you taking for a ride, discoman
Better to run or else to hide discoman, discoman
Tall and neat, watch his feet
Got the jist he's all complete
Understand discomans
Heading for the garbage can
Have you just crossed a bridge too far, discoman
Jump in a cab and steal a car, the worse in the land
Discoman, one night stand, discoman
I can't understand, discoman
What are you doing
Your life's in a ruin
You're out of our head
You oughta be dead
Down the stairs, no-one cares
He who wuins is he who dares
Rock n Roll, lose control
Just forget you're on the dole
But who are you taking for a ride, discoman
Better to run or else to hide, worst in the land
Discoman, one night stand, discoman
I can't understand, discoman
Are you ready...
For the discoman

We are spring
We are summer
We are they who always know
You are love

When the girl in your arms is a girl in your heart,
Then youve got everything,
When youre holding the dream, you can dream when you hold,
You're as rich as a king,
So hold her tight and never let her go
day and night let her know you love her so.
With the love of your life, spend a lifetime of love
Make her young forevermore
So hold her tight and never let her go
day and night let her know you love her so.
With the love of your life, spend a lifetime of love
Make her young forevermore
Make her young forevermore

Workin' this job is a kick in the pants
Workin' this job is like a knife in the back
It ain't gettin' me further than the dump I live in
It ain't gettin' me further than the next paycheck
Workin' this job is like lightin' two fuses
Workin' this job is runnin' out of excuses
It's like a dead-end when a road map is useless
Until I'm dead and there's nothin' to show for my uses
Nobody told me it'd be easy
Or for that matter, it'd be so hard
But it's the livin' and learnin'
It makes the difference
It makes it all worthwhile
It makes it all worthwhile
Workin' this job, there's nothin' left but to hate it
I won't get as far as my daddy made it
It aint gettin' me farther for all my strivin'
In the dead-end I live or the piece of shit I'm drivin'
Nobody told me it'd be easy
Or for that matter, it'd be so hard
But it's the livin' and learnin'
It makes the difference
It makes it all worthwhile
It makes it all worthwhile
Sometimes I dream that I had aimed my life in different ways
But there was nothin' to show me a way to get me outta this place
So I just did what my daddy did before me
Only to find the only door I found was closed to me
Workin' this job, I thought it sucked when I had it
Now it is gone and I'm learnin' what that is
I'm tryin' to hang in to the worst of places
But a family can't live on these fast food wages
Nobody told me it'd be easy
Or for that matter, it'd be so hard
But it's the livin' and learnin'
It makes the difference
It makes it all worthwhile
It makes it all worthwhile
Workin' this job
Workin' this job
Workin' this job

So I'm gliding down the street
Passing by all you people
I suppose I'll never meet
Some of you glare at me
Some of you stare at me
But I am no bicycle thief
Try not to lie
Try not to cheat
A feeling' I try not to repeat
I say somethings beggars believe
But I am no bicycle thief
All of your little crimes
Can you leave them all behind
*I'm just an accomplice
Where do you draw the line
I draw it all the time
*I am just an accomplice
When I ride by, what do you see
Just some guy looking for a quick release
Sometimes you frown
You try and stare me down
But I am no bicycle thief
And all is said and done
Always hurt someone
*You're at least an accomplice
Get it if you can
Never kill a man
*But you're still an accomplice
Somewhere there underneath
I know the ride is going be too brief
Hope for another
Then you may discover
That I am no bicycle thief
All of your little crimes
Can you leave them all behind
*Are you just an accomplice
Where do you draw the line
You draw it all the time
*Are you just an accomplice
And all is said and done
Always hurt someone
*You're at least an accomplice
Get it if you can
You'd never kill a man

I ain't tryin' to dog the old man in red
The white beard or the flyin' sled
Truth be known I always did enjoy
The thought of santa bringin' all the toys
But now rudolph, frosty, and the gang
Christmas it wouldn't have been the same
But our minds didn't miss a line
See, this season was once defined
As a birthday for a mighty king
"yo, hark!" the herald angels sing
About peace and mercy all the while
Yo, on this day we were reconciled
(chorus)
There is a reason for the season
[hey!]
Jesus is the reason
There is a reason for the season
[hey!]
Jesus is, jesus is the reason
He's the reason for the season and my reson to rap
Ya know he put bethlehem on the map
When he was born of a virgin with man and God mergin'
Can't you see that the truth keeps searchin'
On and on and it never ever stops y'all
So break it down and listen as the beat drops
Have you forgotten about the one
The birthday of god's only son?
It's the one gift some refuse to take [word!]
They soon find that they made a mistake
Because now is the time that grace abounds
And now is the time that you should be layin' a crown
The givin' and receivin's all fine and grand
I just want you to understand that
(repeat chorus)
(bridge)
Silent night
[oh silent night]
Oh holy night
[oh holy]
All is calm
And all is bright
Ha ha!
We're gathered in your face!
Christmas it's a festive time
So I decided to deliver a rhyme
In the mood of the season that's pleasin'
But in reality what's the reason for christmas?
It's before your eyes
The first six letters drop the why's
Yo! c-h-r to the i-s-t
So much than just history
See, he is the gift from God the big g
And his blood [yo!] will set you free
So take the gift from the father above
Yo! enjoy some of this christmas love
Ah yeah

I've lost my faith in everything
I couldn't believe in anything
Until I put my faith in you
Is it a sin, is it a crime?
To worship somebody all of the time?
Anytime, I would do anything for you
I've found my heaven, right here with you
Believe in me, forever I believe in you
Not just on Sunday, I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Every night I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
I wasn't looking for a miracle
Didn't think that love was possible
But your love has made me whole
And I pray that this will never end
You are my lover, my best friend
You took me in and saved my soul
I've found my heaven, right here with you
Believe in me, forever I believe in you
Not just on Sunday, I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Every night I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
Not just on Sunday, I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Every night I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
And forgive me for the things that I have done
In the name of the father and the Son
You are my religion

Rain falls down like your alibi
Thought you held the stars in the sky
Till I found your love
Was a lie
And I lost my life
And the days with you my love
All your lines I cannot erase
Pull your fingers from round my brain
But you put this hate
In my eyes
But I love the scars
From the days with you my love

Got a brand new face
So brittle it falls to pieces
My bones are charred and soon I am ash
And I'm clinging to all my soft wickedness

Burn all the candles out
Make a wish but not aloud
Relive the here and now
See you now and then
I'm a revolvin' door
I've seen it all before
I will begin again
But I can't start until I've seen you end
I took a look around
I believe that in these eyes
The treasure's all we've found
May be more than needed
Now that we're old and worn
A little ripped and torn
One day we'll be reborn
One day I will meet you up again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
I'm feelin' out of luck
Maybe I just feel too much
That old familiar touch
Always stained my skin
The good in everyone
The ties we left undone
The heart that meets your blood
All the things bring me 'round again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
Oh yeah
Hey
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]

I'm called a cow
I'm not about
To blow it now
For all the cows
It's funny how money allows all to browse
And be endowed
This wish is true it falls into pieces new
The cow is you
My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows, everything worn in
Like it's a friend
I said you're all a painted doll and it caused
The walls to fall
How far is he?
Impatiently
That's as far as far can be

Step by step and inch to inch
She draws closer than id wish
A little touch, a spark, and itch
Creeps into me telling me this
Hong Kong, Hong Kong Fury
Her intentions I would rather forget
It seems my fortunes have already been set
Anticipation of a deep regret
Got me soaking in a cold, cold sweat
Hong Kong, Hong Kong Fury
Oh her love is like a ferverish disease
Oh she got me down upon my knees
Oh she got me begging please
On my knees, oh yeah
Tiny cut strawberry blood
Broken heart, my face in the mud
She hit me hard, hard as can be
Oh but I want her, I want that disease
Hong Kong, Hong Kong Fury
Oh her love is like a ferverish disease
Oh she got me down upon my knees
Oh she got me begging please
On my knees, oh yeah
Hong Kong, Hong Kong Fury

[Chorus]
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit
Beyond the edge on a downhill run
Some play it cool, some take it easy
Some never know what the snow can do
Some call me fool, some call my crazy
I may be crazy but I'm crazy about you
[Chorus]
You got no guts, you get no glory
There ain't no ruts along the easy ride
Out on the edge it's another story
Some got to take it to the other side
[Chorus]
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit
Beyond the edge on a downhill run
[Chorus: x2]

Ashes fly ashes burn
The sun is black ain't no return
Ashes fly ashes burn
Over and over ain't no need to learn
It's all dust on dust
It's all you and me
Out done completely out played
Just shovel some more dirt on the grave
The choices you make and the choices that are
When hell is so close and heavens so far
Ashes fly and ashes burn
Over and over ain't no need to learn

I stumble through this godforsaken
Uncertain of the path I'm taking
But along the way, I make a smile
I hope where I end up might be worthwhile
Holding in the breath of anger
Inside this old refrigerator
Those days are gone, there's more ahead
So concentrate on what's in store instead
A memory, a dream, or another crazy scheme
Then I find out what I want is something in between
Waking and repeating my routines
Walking circles, talk in circles to me
Words that tumble effortlessly from the lips of fools
Only cloud up what I see in my reflecting pool
Jumping headfirst into symmetry
I am splitting at the seams, hold me

See the sun way up high,
burning down on me.
Mountains rise and kiss the sky,
then crumble to the sea.
But alas all's not well in Eden now,
things ain't what they seem.
There's malice in Wonderland,
malice in Wonderland, and it's getting bad.
The preacher man he looks oh so sad,
he's got a tear in his eye.
His only friend deserted him,
drank a Bourbon bottle dry.
Heaven or hell go where you please,
you'll live with your own curse.
When Hell is full up to the brim,
the dead shall stalk the earth.

Let me sing a song for you and let me be your star
Everytime I look into your eyes I'm really far
Never knowing that to say or knowing what to do
AII the good things in my life are just the though of you.
You are just a wild bird playing in a silver sky
I'm a tree that waits for you to let you rest a while
You can hide here if you want from winter storm and snow
In the shelter of my arms you let your feeling show.
So sweet little wild bird won't you sing 2his song with me
Together we shall sing in perfect tune and harmony
But if you stay aione
yes
in the winter you must die
Yes
I will teach you howto walk
you'll teach m howto fly . . .
So sweet little wild bird
won't you sing this song with me
. . .

She took my hand
And tried to make me understand
That she would always be there,
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today;
I'm such a lonely man.
It came as no surprise to me
That she'd leave me in misery.
It seemed like only yesterday
She made a vow that she'd never walk away.
First Verse
And if it seemed a sin
To love another man's woman, baby,
I guess I'll keep on sinning
Loving her, Lord, till my very last day.
But I looked away
And she ran away from me today;
I'm such a lonely man.

Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kind looked the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walking down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
With a heave, and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no
Well, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no
Well, we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must have thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Looking so good I couldn't let her go
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said, train kept a-rolling all night long

you lead
and i followed
precisely asleep
you sly hypnotist
take me home
you lead
and i followed
broke down with a blowout
just relax with the help
of a yellow pill
"keep your eyes on the road"

Your country raised you, your country fed you
And just like any other country it will break you
On front line send you, tax the hell out you
And just like any other country, it will lock you, up you
Unfortunately there'll be no judgment day
It would be kind of fun to see what they would have to say
When the God they preached would actually be there
And all who didn't like The Stooges would go to fucking hell
Your country raised you, your country fed you
And just like any other country it will break you
On front line send you, tax the hell out you
And just like any other country, it will fuck you, up you
But even all the garbage that they pour over our eyes
Does not prevent us from living most magical of life's
What are all these countries and how did they appear?
And who cut up the cake and who brought up all this gear?
Did it have to do anything with its people's will?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know my dear
It's six in the morning, I'm down in New Orleans
Sister paintings on your wall they will speak to me
And up later on we resume salutations
To the rest of local Tribal Connections
Now think about that sweet baby girl
Sweet baby girl, sweet baby girl
Sweet baby girl, sweet baby girl

When you were young and your heart was free
I'd run and meet you and rush to see
Just over the wall where the clouds roll by
And age and chance and tears were far away
Oh if heaven wouldn't see
Light lovers so distantly
Then look today at this love so free
When you are young again
When you were young and your eyes are old
Then all your treasures my hand can stroke
And all your memories and your sorrows are loosed
And blown and left so your lips may be touched
Oh if heaven wouldn't see
Light lovers so distantly
Then look today at this love so free
When you are young again

Can't stop the wave of sorrow
Every while that you go
Gimme this night
Gimme
Gimme this night
Gimme
Can't stop the wave of sorrow
Every while that you go
Come home (Repeat 4X)
This night of joy follows
Oh everywhere you go
Can't stop the wave of sorrow
Every while that you go
Come home (Repeat 4X)
This night of joy, follows
Oh, everywhere you go
This night of joy
Oh, everywhere you go
[Repeat 3X]
Come home
Come home
Come home

Two faced woman with the two faced lies
I hope your two faced living made you satisfied
Tell me baby I was your only one
While you've been running around town with every mother's son
Told your story about the women like you
Told your story about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I should've listened to my mother's advice
[Chorus]
Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
And I've been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again
Two faced woman, such a crying shame
Don't know nothing, you're all the same
You run around, hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win till the race been run
[Chorus]

take it in my friend
because this is the last time
you'll ever hear my songs
i can't wait to begin again
a fresh start, starts wide open, i'm hoping
i pray for blue sky days
but all i got was a rain
could it be that i'm still the same
well after four years, i'm broken
i'm still hoping
i wanna reach out, i wanna touch yah
i'll be put out
i can't explain all my dirty thoughts now
you were my ???
mainline life
down on me
straight into my hands

Who's gonna hold you
When you're too scared to feel
Who's gonna cure you
When the pain won't heal
Who's gonna be there
When the world goes wrong
Who's gonna tell you
You're the only one
[Chorus]
In my blood
In my soul
In this mind of mine
Can your touch
Turn me cold
Make my glitter shine
Who's gonna reach you
When you can't be caught
Who's gonna teach you
What you can't be taught
Who's gonna beat you
When you won't be fought
Who's gonna buy you
When you can't be bought
[Chorus]
Who's gonna pray for you
When you're too young to kneel
Who's gonna fake it
When it gets too real
One more question answered
In the falling star
I heard they found
Death on mars
[Chorus: x 2]

Send Criss Angel Ringtones to your Cell
Twenty one years of my life to go
Have I lost myself to someone else?
Truth, lie, to live or die
Makes no difference if your never gonna try.
I know I'll die for you
Feed off my sorrow
[Criss whispers]: If you want me too
I know I'll die for you
Bleed for tomorrow
[Criss whispers]: If you want me too
Will you die for me?
But, will you die for me?
See me standing, so fucking cool
Wish you would be like me - a fool
Truth, lie, to live or die
Makes no difference your never gonna fuckin' try.
I know I'll die for you
Feed off my sorrow
[Criss whispers]: If you want me too
I know I'll die for you
Bleed for tomorrow
[Criss whispers]: If you want me too
I know I'll die for you
Feed off my sorrow
[Criss whispers]: If you want me too, If you want me too
I know I'll die for you
[Criss speaks]: Can you feel it, can you see it? If you want me too
Bleed for tomorrow
Will you die for me?
But, will you die for me?
[Criss sofly speaks]: I want you too
I want you too
[even softer]: I want you too
I want you

Monterey Jack woke up in his shack on a Monday
Monterey Jack had a little bitty snack of some elderberry wine
Monterey Jack walked down the track, all the way to ol' Harley's shack
Stuck his knife in ol' Harley's back
And they say that's the way ol' Harley Davison died
1...2...3...4...
Ol' Jack Hoff was gettin' off in a doorway
Ol' Jack Hoff was gettin' off with little Sarah Lee
Ol' Jack Hoff was gettin' off when he mumbled and stumbled and started to cough
And his vein went hard and he went soft
And they say that's the way how ol' Jack Hoff O.G.'d
Spoken:
You mean O.D.
No.... O.G.
Oh man what's that?
That's when you O.D and you say Oh Gee!
1...2...3...4...
Tom McCann was sittin' in the sand by the ocean
Tom McCann looked into his hand and found a jelly-roll
Tom McCann was feelin' grand, all the girls were lickin' his hand
He's a heel but man, oh man, everybody knows that Tom McCann's got soul
Spoken:
Its over
No it ain't
No it ain't either, here it is again
That's really the end

She comes to find me way too soon
And leaves me leaves me way too fast
For my heart, to be anywhere but with the moon
You know, it's cold out there and it?s dark
Yeah, keep playing a part in this thing till the end
All good things have an end, oh, they do
And I wished upon a shooting star
And thought about the spaces between
Two hearts that can never ever let go
And I used to watch the way she moved
The way she crossed the park at night
To buy some milk after staying in bed all day
In the spaces between
In the spaces between
Takes so long just to kinda believe
In the scars that we've got
In the spaces between
Takes so long just to kinda believe
In the scars that we've got
In the spaces between

If Linda Blair was my Lolita
Her head could spin.
She would levitate, vomit green
beat a priest
what a teen.
Dick Clark would grin.
And foul things'd surt without discretion
From her tiny mouth
She'd say "spank me spank me spank me DADDY."
Mommy's in bandages and smoking too
She doesn't like it when I tell her too
(chorus)
I don't know what's come over me
I'm not my self today.
I don't know what's come over me
Linda's all the rage
The Devil's underage.
Get that cross right out of their girl
You don't know where it's been.
You're 13, underage, into bondage,
it's just a phase
You're too young to sin.
Speaking tounges backwards in Latin.
Let me hear you say
"Spank me spank me spank me DADDY."
Comin' down stairs just to piss on the rug.
She's gonna get all this gnarly love.

The Power of Christ compels you

Is it too late to prevent their fall
Are they ready for the key to it all
The mystery solved, the answer to life
The final solution, a chance to survive
We can save this ill-fated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on the river of time
Follow the wave, speed up the flight
Slow down time, faster than light
Unite the forces, take a giant leap
Bend the stream, dive into the deep
We can save this ill-fated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on a river of time
Send back visions of war and decay.
Paradigms of fear in a world of dismay.
Shape the present, alter the past.
Create a new future, one that would last
We can save this ill-fated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on a river of time

So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain
I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Aaaaah tears that filled my bong
Aaaaah years expended gone
I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Aaaah tears that filled my bong
Aaaah years expended gone
Aaaah tears that filled my bong
Aaaah years expended gone
Aaaah tears that filled my bong
Aaaah years expended gone
Check my brain, check my brain...

Alienated and jaded
The flame has faded
Hands bound and powerless
Expect nothing less
The trust, the lust
All seemed a must
The time you lied
Echo inside my mind
And you lied
And pushed it my face
And you lied
And you lied
And pushed it in my face again
Shot down
Left for dead
Forever seeing red
Frustrated and betrayed
Behold what you made
The place, the time
The plan, your crime
No love, there's none
You fucking did me wrong
Alienated
Beat down and jaded
Restrained and powerless
Inside, nothingness
Disgraced, confined
And damned and blind
You lied so long
You fucking did me wrong
Did me wrong
And you just lied to me
Did me wrong
Did me wrong
And you just lied to me
You just lied
...again

Cornelius - was favored by God
He prayed to him constantly, daily
Oh, Cornelius was in the army
A pagan believer from Rome
Cornelius! An angel from God
Came straight to the spot he was praying
Oh, Cornelius! Acts 10 in verse 3
The angel said Peter must come to your home
Makin' lunch in the afternoon
Where was Peter? Up on Simon's roof
He went up on top to pray
And the Lord sent some men there to take him away
Cornelius said, "Hey, can we start?
We're waitin' upon what you're sayin'"
So Cornelius, fell down on his knees
But Peter said "Please do not" so - he got up
True salvation! They trusted in Him
They called on the Lord there on that day
To the nations that once were in sin
God opened the doors there on that day

Awake again. Sleep never seems to come although my mind remains idle, how many times have I been through this? So I, so I walk down the street and watch my breath rise up. Can't help but regret, what could have been? What could have been? Did I? Well, I threw it all away. Well, I threw it all away. So I wonder where do we stand now? What do you know, I only hear from you when you seem to be down. When the world seems to kick you around, you write or show up here and ask me "Why?" But I say, I say to you, "You know you." You threw it all away. You threw it all away. And the letters you write, they read like lies. And the letters I write, well I write lies. And the letters you write, they read like lies. And the letters I write, well I write lies. And I guess I can't complain. everything is alright. Guess it's time to say goodbye (goodbye). Guess I can't complain. Everything, it's okay and, and if you want to know, I can sum it up best by: Lately I have felt like a rag doll. Lately I have felt like a rag doll. Lately I have felt like a rag doll.

People rushin' everywhere
If they'd only slow down once
They might find something there
Green trees and timber land
People workin' with their hands
For sure a different way to live
Gonna keep my cabin at hand
Retreat and live off the land
All around Ukiah, wo
The mountain streams that rush on by
Show the fish a jumpin'
And reflect the open sky
The fresh clean smell of the pines
Symbol of unchanging times
All around this sacred land
Strangely, though, I've found my way
Right here I'm gonna stay
In this land Ukiah, wo

In my darkest hour just before the dawn
There's no sound from the empty street
But sleep won't seem to come to me
All your words in my head
Linger on and on
They've come to steal my time away
Till the night is gone
I must be losing my shine
Like an old dusty Burgundy wine
In a cellar cool and damp
Dull beneath a yellow lamp
No one turning the key
To come and get me today
The more I think about you now
The more I'm feeling that way
I see you there, everywhere
Optical illusions
Telephone, let it ring
I don't want intrusions in my life
I know tomorrow I'll find
There's nothing here at all
Just some trick your mind will play
With shadows on the wall
I see you here, feel you near
Optical illusions
Nothing real that I feel
Just some confusion of my time
In my darkest hour, when all the blinds were drawn
You're just some mirage I saw
Just before the dawn

Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
You know the blues is my companion, every night and every day
The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
I wish I could change her mind, but I know it's no use for me to try
Yes will you talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Won't you please talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Let me tell you how I miss you baby and how it feels to be alone
So brother, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
Say, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
You better treat her like an angel and keep her home at any price

AYREON SINGS OF THE USELESSNESS OF THE COUNTLESS WARS TO COME,
AND THE ABSURDITY OF THE FINAL ANNIHILATION BY THE PUSH OF JUST ONE BUTTON
BY JUST ONE MAN.
[AYREON:]
echoes of a thousand screams
smoke, blood and fire
a deserted battlefield
millions of men will die
at one man's desire
and the docile mass will yield
all through the ages
men will die before their time
in an everlasting war
as long as man is taught
that war is not a crime
man will fight for evermore
out of the ashes
a war-lord will arise
and tyrannize the land
his reign of terror
will cost many a sacrifice
an inferno is at hand
all through the centuries
men will be caged
in the name of liberty
as long as man shall live
wars will be waged
or will we ever be set free?
Set me free!
the road to ruin
gets shorter all the time
as technology will improve
it takes but one man
to commit the ultimate crime
and make the final move

This is gonna sound
A little obsessive
A little bit strange
I have one thing to say
Before I turn and I walk away
This is gonna sound
A little impulsive
This is gonna sound
A little insane
I know you don't know me yet
But you and I
We will be together
Someday
Someday
I know, I know, I sound
Like I'm on drugs
But listen to me now
When I say
That ever since when I first saw you
Sitting on your car outside
You asked for a cigarette
I couldn't stop staring
At your eyes
Ever since when I first saw you
Looking bored in that plastic chair
With the lights of the office
Around you
Those blond streaks
They look so pretty
In your black hair
You look cool and alternative
With that disaffected stare
You want people to think
That you just don't care
Hey you can be with me
'cause I just might be the one
Who will treat you like you're perfect
Who will always make you come
You can be with me
I will always let you win
I will never be like those other guys
I will never be your
Unemployed boyfriend
This is gonna sound
A little bit out there
This is gonna sound
A little insane
But I keep having the same dream
That you will
Be the mother of my children
Someday
Someday
I heard you sleep with that
Obnoxious guy
I know he is in that famous band
You look so sad when you
Are with him
I never see him reach
To hold your hand
You can be with me
Yes I will treat you like a queen
I will go to all those
Chick flick movies
That I really don't want to see
You can be with me
No I will never let you down
I will never make out
With your girlfriend
When I know you're not around
You can be with me
Yeah I just might be the one
Who will treat you like you're special
I will always make you come
You can be with me
I will always let you win
I will never be like those other guys
I will never be like those other guys!
I will never be your
Unemployed boyfriend

I see ya flyin' in your UFO all the time
Crash and burnin' in my backyard
It's begs and achin' all the time
I ridin' on your brainwaves
Surfin in a dream
I wish you'd save those dreams for me
I see you flyin' in your UFO all the time
I don't remember what day it was
Begs and achin' all the time

It's coming on the end of August.
Another summer's promise almost gone.
And thought I heard some wise men say that every dog will have his day,
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long.
I don't know when I realized the dream was over.
Well, there was no particular hour, no given day.
You know it didn't go down in flames,
There was no final scene, no frozen frame,
I just watched it slowly fade away.
And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for my time to come around again.
And hope is floating on the breeze,
Carrying my soul high up above the ground.
And I've been keeping to myself,
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing.
Even know you're with somebody else,
He'll never love you like I do.
I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows,
While peacocks prance and strut up on the stage.
If finding love is just a dance, proximity and chance,
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade.
And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for the dust to settle down.
Along the back roads, running through the fields,
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town.
And I imagine sunlight in your hair, you're at the county fair,
You're holding hands and laughing,
And now the Ferris Wheel has stopped,
You're swinging on the top, suspended there with him,
And he's the darling of the chic, playboy of the week,
The flavor of the week is melting down your pretty summer dress, baby what a mess you're making.
I've been stumbling though some dark places,
And I'm following the cloud.
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's all right now.
And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for the summer rain to fall.
Upon the wild birds, scattering the seeds,
Answering the calling of the
Tide's Eternal tune, the phases of the moon,
The chambers of the heart, the egg and dart.
A small gray spider spinning in the dark,
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart.
And I've been waiting in the weeds,
Waiting for my time to come around again.
And hope is floating on the breeze,
Carrying my soul high up above the ground.
And I've been keeping to myself,
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing.
Even know you're with somebody else,
He'll never love you like I do.

Can you feel the wind blow, closer day by day
Blowing with a motion, for a brand new day
Demonchild, why have you been gone
Do you still miss, miss your family
Oh, I'll bet it hurts to loose so much
Can you feel the wind blow, closer day by day
Blowing with a motion, for a brand new day
Demonchild, what have you been through
I can still hear, hear you crying
So you better find a cure

I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
So very warm and tender the way you loved me
Hey girl can't you remember and want more of me
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie how can you go
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I am regretting but can't stop forgetting because
You were my first love
You said now you don't need me because I cheated
Why didn't you believe me when I repeated
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll never know
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
I walk alone
I cry at home
Night after night
(Night after night)
Day after day
Oh,
I never cheated
Oh
I still repeated
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll never know
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love

I am iron, God!
Ooh!
Oh
Oh
Erah
Iron
Oow!
Red Rum

[GUITAR SOLO]
I don't remember how I got this way.
I don't recall what happened yesterday.
I don't remember what I did last night.
But I know I was feelin' all right.
And we all had a real good time.
Somebody told me I was out of my mind.
And we all had a real good time.
I couldn't stop myself from feelin' fine.
[GUITAR SOLO]
Got so loud that I couldn't hear the phone.
In the nick a-time I called, no one was home.
The girl was rockin', so I crawled across the floor.
I tried to make it, but I couldn't find the chord.
So we all had a real good time.
Somebody told me I was out of my mind.
But we all had a real good time.
I couldn't stop myself from feelin' fine.
[GUITAR SOLO]
Here we are now, the time is right.
Feelin' good like I did last night.
I can tell, you're feelin' good too.
Come on with me, I wanna party with you.
And we all had a real good time.
Somebody told me I was out of my mind.
And we all had a real good time.
Don't try to stop yourself from feelin' fine.
And we all had a real good time.
[REPEAT TO FADE]

I met this girl who likes her heavy metal
She gets excited when slipknot plays on
Leno she's a heck of a girl with no cares in
The world and she likes it that way
She wears black socks with pink stripes in
'Em and she swears that her friend goes
Out with Richard Simmons she's a one of a
Kind I can't get off my mind and I like it that way
And if you listen closely you will hear then say
Stand clear she's the girl of the year and
There's no use in trying to get her off my
Mind she stole my heart and she's tearing
It apart it's never gonna be the same
She's a love potion that plays with your
Emotions a big swimmer that won't go
Near the ocean and if everything's fine
She'll get to work on time and they like her hat way
She wears black socks with pink stripes in
'Em and she swears that her friend goes
Out with Richard Simmons she's a one of a
Kind I can't get off my mind and I like it that way
And if you listen closely you will hear then say
Stand clear she's the girl of the year and
There's no use in trying to get her off my
Mind she stole my heart and she's tearing
It apart it's never gonna be the same
And now I'm taping myself together
I'm taping myself together again now
I'm taping myself together
I'm taping myself together again
And I won't let this happen again ey-eh,
Hey-eh, ey-e-yeah-e-yeah-eh, eh-eh, hey-eh
Ey-e-yeah-e-yeah-eh
Hey, hey, together again and, again and
Again and together, again and, again and
Again and again
Stand clear she's the girl of the year and
There's no use in trying to get her off my mind
She stole my heart and she's tearing it
Apart she stole my heart and she's tearing
It apart she stole my heart
And she's tearing it apart she stole my heart
And she's tearing it apart now
It's never gonna be the same

Some days are worst than others
Some days I Can not feel a thing
Someday I might just prove you wrong
Something just might go my way
Today I've got something to prove to you
All these things I never do for you
Is making you angrier everyday
Pushing me farther away
You make me a mess, I can't keep it together
Somehow, someway, I am gonna prove you wrong
I am gonna prove you wrong
Someday I might stay sober
Figure out where I am wrong
Making sense of what left of me
Make a go of this alone
I've got nothing left for you
So sick of all the things you do
Turn your back on me everyday
You pushing me farther away
You make me a mess, I can't keep it together
Somehow, someway, I am gonna prove you wrong
I am gonna prove you wrong
Hey yea
You make me a mess
I can't keep it together
I fall away, and now I prove you wrong
Prove you wrong
Prove you wrong

Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree
An apple tree,
Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked
So he sent forth to hire me
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea
But a never in my traveling days
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,
For it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, laugh a little apple
Well all the apples were hidin'
Frightened that they might be plucked
And everytime that somebody passed
All except that one little apple ducked
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea
But a never in my traveling days
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,
For it will bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, laugh a little apple

Just suppose, this old car sputtered down the road
Just suppose
Just suppose, this old car, it refused to go
Just suppose
Wouldn't you hope that someone
Would take her time to stop and help you out?
I'd like to think that someone
Would care enough to stop and help you out
It's the code, it's the code it's the code of the road
It's the code, it's the code, it's the code of the road
On the side of the road, maybe, you'd like to know
A hand is there, a hand that cares, it's the code of the road
It's the code of the road
Don't you know everyone breaks down along the road?
Don't you know?
Don't you know everybody hurts along the road?
Don't you know?
Wouldn't you hope that someone
Would take her time to stop and help you out?
I'd like to think that someone
Would care enough to stop and help you out
It's the code, it's the code it's the code of the road
It's the code, it's the code, it's the code of the road
On the side of the road, maybe, you'd like to know
A hand is there, a hand that cares, it's the code of the road
It's the code, it's the code, it's the code of the road
It's the code, it's the code, it's the code of the road
It's the code, it's the code, it's the code of the road
It's the code, it's the code, it's the code of the road
It's the code of the road
It's the code of the road
In weakness, Jesus took the time to stop
It help me out

Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see I gotta make you understand
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter baby 'cos' today's another day
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
Remember, tonight we're gonna run 'till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it
We'll never stop we got a good thing goin' on
I know you've heard it all before
But I really need you darlin' every day I need you more
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
Can you understand (yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
It's been a year now and it's getting so much better
You came home without a word
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her
They couldn't see and they just didn't understand
And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
Can you understand (yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
How many days had I been waiting there to tell you
I really can't believe
We're walkin' out into the world tonight
We'll do it all again until the break of light
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see

Standing there, I've been watching you
All alone, your face says it all
Desperately I need to talk to you
Can you see me, will you answer my call?
[Chorus]
Am I in love, or is it the magic of tonight?
Am I in love, or is it the magic of tonight?
And will it be right tomorrow morning?
Hold me now, I feel you close to me
It's so good, so good I want more
Something stirs deep inside of me
Face to face as we move, my life is yours
[Chorus]
Just one kiss, remember this
And it will stay with you forever
[Chorus]

We all know politicians only go
Just half-way there
Just half-way there
The innocence of youth needs protection not abuse
But no one seems to care
Yet no one seems to care
And you sit there and watch the world go around
From your pseudo-benevolent vantage point
While we who've been left to pick up after you
Try our best to make some sense for those who
Come next
Now what have you done to foster the truth
Besides just hide hide the lies?
Besides just hide hide the lies?
A selfish campaign never justifies the gain
But the means are verified
Yeah the means are verified
And you sit there and insist you are right
From your popular psychological podium
While those who rely and depend on you
They wilt because you don't accept we need
Each other

These are the days
When I fear for my life
Think that's strange
Well that's the waste of you
Sun up time now for you to run
I will always know you - You're a special one
Now I'm up on this climb, up on this climb
I won't fade away
The best if yet to come
Sad you're not around
The best is yet to come
Better get your feet on the ground
Prisoner or passenger
A free man on scavenger
I'm a prizefighter
I'm a prizefighter
Who will be there
Cover when you fall
We're all chasing something
How come you never call
The best is yet to come
Sad you're not around
The best is yet to come
Better get your feet back on the ground
Prisoner of passenger
A free man or scavenger
I'm a prizefighter
I'm a prizefighter
Prisoner of passenger
A free man or scavenger
I'm a prizefighter
I'm a prizefighter
I thought you were all beautiful
It doesn't make sense, sense, sense
I'm a prizefighter
I'm a prizefighter
I'm a prizefighter

In a purple vision
Many thousand years ago
I saw the silent stranger
Walk the earth alone
Twenty-seven faces
With their eyes turned to the sky
I've got a camera
And an airtight alibi
I know they're out there
We see them coming
Faster than the speed of light
They greet us in the dead of the night
Somewhere, someday, someone
They'll be light and sound
They'll alight on the ground
On which we stand
Somewhere, someday, someone
Will help us to survive
They're gonna show us hell
And bring us back alive
Well, I'm no poet, but I can't be fooled
The lies don't count, the whispers do
I hear the whispers on the wind
They say the earth has fallen due
We run in circles
Our days are numbered
Every night I look away
To the heavens and I pray
Come to us
Come to us
Our lights are dim
Our roads are crumbling
And we don't know what to do
We're sick and tired
And dying to meet you
'cause we bit off more than
We can chew

Leaping quick on leopard's back
I face the brunt of his attack
In the land of nod i'm king
Until the alarm clock rings
Stepping out from safety's door
I hear the rushing traffic roar
Smiling to myself i say,
"...hooray its a brand new day"
Slashing my way through vine
I'll kill if i have to
I'll be there on time
Clawed through the freeway jam
I curse at the guy who passed me
Last time 'round
In my office settled back
Drink a cup of coffee (black)
Stretch my mind and try'n erase
The thought of the day to face
Life is like the leopard's den
And once you find you've fallen in
A safari of the heart
Surely comes to an end
Madness is our damnation
Strange is the situation we're all in
To one man it matters nothing
Others it shatters something; no one wins
I could not see it myself (though i'd read about it)
I could not hear it myself (though i'd heard about it)
I could not feel it myself (though i knew that it was real)
I could not hear it myself (don't you lie about it)
I could not feel it myself (but don't you cry about it)
For there's an animal in us all
The brunt of which you'll see

Oh, Lordy, Lord
Oh, Lordy, Lord
Oh, it hurt me so bad for us to part
Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
You on my mind every place I go
Oh, how much I love you, baby, you will never know
Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Oh, that's my story
All I've got to say to you
Oh, goodbye baby, I don't care what you do
Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Another pride
Another tune
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season
Another reason
For making whoopie
A lot of shoes
A lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killing, that he's so willing
To make whoopie
Ugh.
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture that same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washing dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget folks
That's what you get folks
For making whoopie
Another year, or maybe less
What's this I hear
Oh can't you guess
She feels neglected
And he's suspected
Of making whoopie
Oooh she sits at home, most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he's busy
And she says "Is he?"
He's making whoopie
Ugh.
He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge thinks he's funny
Says he will give six to her
And he says "Judge, what if I fail?"
The judge says, "Budge, straight into jail
You better keep her, I think it is cheaper
Than making whoopie"

Spark of sulfur ignites,
The remnants of tonight,
Space still echoes,
The solitude of night,
What you're after may not,
Shine so bright,
Midnight concealing,
All of these lies,
Blood from beneath the skin,
It's just a voice calling,
Don't wanna hear it, don't wanna make a scene,
If you catch me now then I'll see you in hell,
If you make amends, will you make it back?
And if you have the time, will you crack a smile?
This is only a test,
To prove your innocence,
Take the pill that you don't lie, to satisfy,
Following everything gonna die,
He pushed his way into the space between her broken self,
Now he just stands here waiting, waiting,
Blood from beneath the skin,
It's just a voice calling,
Don't wanna hear it, don't wanna make a scene,
If you catch me now I'm crawling back from hell,
If you make amends, will you make it back?
And if you have the time, will you crack a smile?

I hear cries tonight
I hear cries tonight
Ain't no love
Ain't no life
I hear cries tonight
I hear cries tonight
I hear cries tonight
I hear, I hear
I hear cries tonight
I hear cries tonight
I hear cries tonight
I hear, I hear
Like all of the best, We've been taken
Like all of the lost, we've been had
Pray God, kingdom come, deliver us,
Amen
All life, is it lost, have they won
Ain't no love in a concrete kingdom,
Ain't much life
Ain't no life in a concrete kingdom,
I hear cries tonight
Ain't no love
Ain't no life
Ain't no right,
What's for my son
When all of the good,
Have been taken
Where all of the lost,
Have gone
Ravaged, then raped, annihilation-amen
All life, is it lost, have they won
Ain't no love in a concrete kingdom
Ain't much light
Ain't no life in a concrete kingdom
I hear the cries tonight
Ain't no love
Ain't no light
Ain't no right
Ain't much love in a concrete kingdom,
Ain't much light
What's for my son
I - I want to know why
I want to know why,
We're shrinking from the sun
I said now I, I want to know why
I want to know why, there's poison - Everyone
There ain't no love, in a concrete kingdom
Ain't much light
Ain't no life in a concrete kingdom
I hear the cries tonight - I hear, I hear
Ain't no love
Ain't no light
Ain't no right
Ain't much love in a concrete kingdom
Ain't much light
Ain't no light - in a concrete kingdom
Ain't no light
Ain't no right
Ain't no light
Ain't no right
What's for my son

She screams sweet hell, in her old white nightie
With rips and tears she's too aware
See through big black bombs that explode on chickens
All the while she thickens
From the cracks in the mortar
Cracks in the mortal
Baby's got ruby jewel lashes
That'll whip your spine
I see you grew into that stiff gray suit they've sewn for you
Scrub you clean now you forget what you mean
Wimp worm completely thick it's you who makes me sick
With a great old brick and mortar
Cracks in the mortar
Cracks in the mortal
[Incomprehensible] cracks in the mortar
Baby's got ruby jewel lashes
That'll whip your spine
Every time she blinks makes me sink
Into ruby, ruby, ruby jewel lashes
So I put on my best Sunday dress
And I waltz straight into this mess
Posing as a guest or something much less
Than a crazy old doll in a crazy old dress
Cracks in the mortar
Cracks in the mortal
[Incomprehensible] cracks in the mortar
Baby's got ruby jewel lashes
That'll whip your spine
Well, the thin moon sugar it shines like a [Incomprehensible], now
The thin moon sugar it shines like a [Incomprehensible], now
The thin moon sugar it shines like a [Incomprehensible], now for me

Whenever I'm hurt, you are my nurse
You stand beside me through all seasons
You clean up my face, you fill up my space
With white linen and syringes
Out on the road you carry my load
Make it lighter when I feel weak
And when i am blind you crawl in my mind
And make me wiser than I could ever be alone
I know it ain't easy
I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
When I make a mess you wash and you dress me
When I'm wired you talk me down
When I'm a fool you're calm and you're cool
I never want for anything when you're around
When I'm in your bed, all you ever do
Is treat me with respect, but I don't know how
I know It ain't easy
Yes, I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
Though I've made some big mistakes
You don't complain at all
Even when you come and find me
Crying like a baby
Standing up in the bathtub
Whenever I'm hurt, you are my nurse
You stand beside me through all seasons
You're patient when I'm slow, warm when I'm cold
You're everything I'm not, you know everything I don't
I know it ain't easy
I know it's getting harder for you
I know it ain't easy
But these are the roads that we choose
These are the roads that we choose
These are the roads that we choose

So are you turning around your mind?
Do you think the sun won't shine this time?
Are you breathing only half of the air?
Are you giving only half of a chance?
Don't you wanna shake?
Because you love
cry?
Because you care
feel?
Cause you're alive
sleep?
Because you're tired
shake?
Because you love
cry?
Because you care
feel?
Cause you're alive
Make heaven, heaven out of hell now
Make heaven, heaven out of hell now
Are you locked up in you counting the days?
Oh how long until you have your freedom, your freedom?
Just shake
Because you love
Cry
Because you care
Sleep
Because you're tired
Feel
'Cause you're alive
Shake
Because you love
Bleed
'Cause you got hurt
Die
Because you lived
make heaven, heaven out of hell now.
I want you to
make heaven, heaven out of hell now.
Are you still turning around the same things?
Are you still trying that way?
Are you still praying the same prayers?
Are you still waiting for that same day to come?
Climbing the same mountain
You're not getting higher
Running after yourself
You can't let go
Hiding in that place you don't wanna be
You push happiness so far away
but it comes back
To give you all that you've given before
To love you the way you do, like a mirror
Look in the air and catch that boomerang
Can't fall anywhere else but in your own head
So make heaven
heaven out of hell now
I need you to
Make heaven
Heaven out of hell now.
I want you to
(Are you still waiting?)
Make heaven
(Are you still praying?)
Heaven out of hell now
(Are you still losing?)
I want you to
Make heaven
Heaven out of hell now
(I wanna fly because I dream)
I want you to
(dream dream dream...)
Make heaven
Heaven out of hell now

In a car outside, we stalk the idle kind.
If you're leaving, just let me know.
Tobacco and peppermint, dusting for fingerprints.
A film in her eyes from the glow.
Some rules are made with all intentions to break
And she defends it with a warped rationale.
And I've seen what happens to the wicked and proud
When they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown.
And we learn as we age.
Wait for nothing
And my body still aches.
And you take cause they give.
Though I love you
And my body it leaks like a sieve.
When it got old outside, smoke beneath the playground lights.
If you're coming home, just let me know.
Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins.
A film in her eyes from the glow.
Concrete and water, she's looking for her daughter
At midnight in torrential downpour.
And everything I said about how messed your head is,
Were cut up and left in bits and pieces on the ground.
And we learn as we age.
We've learned nothing and my body still aches.
And you take cause they give.
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve.
And we learn as we age.
We've learned nothing and my body still aches.
And you take cause they give.
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve.
Take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters.
Take the picture from the frame and it's a long ways to the floor.
Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you.
Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the door.
And we learn as we age.
Wait for nothing and my body still aches.
And you take cause they give.
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve.

The Haunted House
Have YOU ever BEEN
to A HAUNTED HOUSE?
bET YOU have!
a place you didn't understand
a place that frightened you
Did you SEE?
Did you HEAR?
Did you THINK?
that you knew what was around the corner
think back to a time
to a place where you felt you had been before
but couldn't understand why you felt that way
De'ja' voo
Did you hear the noise?
Did you SEE the light?
BATs flying way UP high
MONSTERS walking through a haze
coming
CLOSER, CLOSER, CLOSER
Do you SEE how it collides
with R E A L I T Y?
We walk in a trance every day
No time for reflecting
Always in a hurry
Driving our weapons of destruction
faster, faster, faster
No time for KINDNESS
No time to GIVE
No time to FEEL
I saw a woman
in the LAUNDROMAT
I heard her ask
how much it would cost to repair
her TORN clothes
She looked like a deer
caught in the CROSSFIRE
Was so worried about how much it cost
no A F F E CT
i knew in my heart and soul
that she needed HELP
so i gave her a coin
so she could get
her clothes repaired
Didn't want her to worry about whether she could eat
And as i was about to leave discretely
she asked said: WHO ARE YOU?
I was startled because i knew
that she REMEMBERED
REMEMBERED
REMEMBERED
She knew that i understood
HER PAIN
Because I was that woman
in another LIFE
a VAGABOND, who lost HER way
due to circumstance
It is the people who can still feel the pain
they are the ONES
who are still AWAKE
they haven't let their HEARTS
fall asleep
they haven't let their souls be silenced
or encased in SEA of DENIAL
We've all been in THE HAUNTED HOUSE
Blinded by our goals
JUST trying to make ends meet
But what about GOODNESS?
We forgot ABOUT goodness
we forgot that goodness COUNTS
more than anything
more than MONEY, POWER, or FAME
GOODNESS counts!
don't forget
it's all that matters
don't forget
don't forget
It's all that really matters
Just be good
and try to do the RIGHT thing
and (s)he will forgive us
if we mess up
just take the time
just make the effort
to do the right thing
and (s)he will forgive us
for (s)he knows that we are only human
and that we live in a haunted house
a house that makes us forget
where we've been

It's funny what goes through your mind
When you think of times you spent together
Funny but when I think back why we broke up
The reasons seem so small
One day she's with me, everything's fine
Sayin' somethin' sounded like I love you
The next week I see her walkin' down the street with someone else
Probably sayin' the same thing, it's doin' my brain in
I got nothin'
(I got nothin')
Goin' nowhere
(Goin' nowhere)
Tired of under achievin'
I keep searchin'
(I keep searchin')
Nothin's workin'
(Nothin's workin')
It's not enough just to be breathin'
I need somethin' to believe in
Yeah, I need something
It's funny what goes on in your head
When you think about the way things come together
But now I think back why things had to change
The reasons seem so small
Cruel twist of fate, keepin' me awake
When I need to sleep to take away the hurtin'
But now I got time on my hands tryin' to understand
But there ain't no explainin', it's doin' my brain in
I got nothin'
(I got nothin')
Goin' nowhere
(Goin' nowhere)
Tired of under achievin', yeah
I keep searchin'
(I keep searchin')
Nothin's workin'

I keep searchin'

Nothin's workin'

It's not enough just to be breathin'
I need somethin' to believe in
Yeah, what about you?
I need somethin' to believe in, yeah, yeah, yeah

It seems like every single day
I hear all of my friends say
You're just too damn crazy
And it seems like every dawn that breaks
I reflect on what it takes
Sometimes I just can't see past this
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
Seems like every single time
When I hear that Patsy Cline
I think of when we were younger
Now I see people and their lies
Through frosted glass and swollen eyes
Can't you just get over yourself and call?
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
Oh yeah, we got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
Because we got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it

I wanna ride with you honey/ I wanna roll around the kitchen floor/ I wanna fight with you honey/ So we can make up and make love some more/ You gotta little bit of soul in your step/ You're the best kisser I ever met/ You never ever do what you should/ Baby how did you get to be so good?

We have both been here before
Knockin' upon love's door
Begging for someone to let us in
Knowing this we can agree to keep each other company
Never to go down that road again
My beloved one, my beloved one
Your eyes shine through me
You are so divine to me
Your heart has a home in mine
We won't have to say a word
With a touch all shall be heard
When I search my heart it's you I find
My beloved one, my beloved one, my beloved one
You were meant for me, I believe you were sent to me from a dream straight into
To my arms
Hold your body close to me
You mean the most to me
We will keep each other safe from harm
My beloved one, my beloved one, my beloved one

I was waiting for a mermaid to appear
Saying "come little boy
Drown your fears," you're young
We're being explorers with the spirit of Doctor Livingston
We'll talk to the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
We won't
Die together in the desert, we'll escape from the new men of prey
We'll smile like the French Resistance
And laugh at the guillotine
We'll talk to the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
Disapproved
Of life around them
So they created a world of their own
You're my last
Request
Before the firing squad
Bullets
Cannot penetrate the sea
We'll hide in the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
Why should heroes
Always die in battle, take the violin
We're exiles
Exiles
We're getting old

I said, oh my, I don't know why
I was just busy watching everyone go by
Outside the shite bar and you're a red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar
I said oh Christ, I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I once heard, you drive a bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard
And it's all right, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh, any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh, she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed, so easy to be Friday's nightmare
I said, oh no, oh, please just go
You got no eyelids and sweet Ella loves me so
She got my number, though I can't stand her
I can't help diggin' her a hope I guess I wonder
And oh, it's clear, you want me dear
It would be easier if I was never here
You got the money and I got the reason
I'll stick around with you for just another season
And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh, any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh, she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed, so easy to be Friday's nightmare
She's just getting along
So don't tell me she's yours
Oh, please tell me I'm wrong again
It's all in a day
So what can you say
Just sleep in your shoes
With the winterbox blues
And it's time you choose, oh yeah
She said, oh my, I don't know why
I was just busy watching everyone go by
What's this I once heard, you drive a bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard
And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh, any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh, she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed, so easy to be Friday's wonder

We've broken down, we're fading out, and you fall on your knees, and stand defeat, just when it feels like hell is freezing over, hold on, embrace, this symphony.
Let's play the very first line, it feels much better,
And it's all in time, it's coming together,
When the drums come in, the keys getting louder,
Now I'm building a collision of chords.
This time it's not tiny voices, it's a chorus of noise,
We're surfing a see of places, now, now, now we're singing,
A fanfare of sound, pulled out from within,
We fly through the broken minor,
Woah, woah, woah, we've come back down.
When you've been let down, it's a bitter end,
Everyone stands off, you know, you're lost again,
The lights are fading and we're still escapingm
The city and twilight that marks and fills the sky.
Let's play the very first line, it feels much better,
And it's all in time, it's coming together,
When the drums come in, the keys getting louder,
Now I'm building a collision of chords.
This time it's not tiny voices, it's a chorus of noise,
We're surfing a see of places, now, now, now we're singing,
A fanfare of sound, pulled out from within,
We fly through the broken minor,
Woah, woah, woah, we've come back down.
Not the last time, I can't stay...I can't stay away..
It's not the last time.
Let's play the very first line, it feels much better,
And it's all in time, it's coming together,
When the drums come in, the keys getting louder,
Now I'm building a collision of chords.
This time it's not tiny voices, it's a chorus of noise,
We're surfing a see of places, now, now, now we're singing,
A fanfare of sound, pulled out from within,
We fly through the broken minor,
Woah, woah, woah, we've come back down.
(Woah oh, woah oh.....) A fanfare of sound, pulled out from within, we fly through the broken minor,
Woah, woah, woah, we've come back down.

Somethin's wrong with my life and I'm crazy
Somethin's hard on my mind, guess who
It's tough to live with the lights on maybe
All we need is a spine for you
Somethin's wrong with my mind and I'm angry
Somethin's hard on my life, guess who
It's tough to light what we live for maybe
All we need is a spine for you

Yeah, I guess I'm better off dead, yeah
Fuck tomorrow, fuck tomorrow

Yeah, what's misery supposed to do?
Sell your soul or it's lights out, maybe
All we need is a spine for you

See me come and see me go
In my fancy resturant
All the time you never know
No, I can't pay for any of it
Don't like the way you use your tongue
To get one up on me
Oh man, can't you see.
How do you think we got this far
I go, hey man, look at me sing
Oh man I got a brand new thing
It goes a bada, bada, bada hey man
Don't know what I was waiting for
See me passed out there on the floor
See that girl over there, dress her up all in my stare
Don't want any of you to leave
Keep you 'round just as scenery
Oh, man can't you see
It seems the way of Sydney

What'd you say
when I said
we'll be here through tomorrow
in my heart and in my head
Fear of failure
Fear of reprimand
Two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what I have inside
what I have inside
Values here
in my heart
and we'll be here through tomorrow
Every day's a brand new start
Fear of failure
Fear of reprimand
Two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what I have inside
what I have inside
Fear of reprimand
Two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what I have inside

Love hangs herself
With the bedsheets in her cell
Threw myself on fires for you
10 good reasons to stay alive
10 good reasons that I can't find
Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body, so sick in his soul
Oh, give me one reason to be beautiful
Oh, and everything I am
Love hates you
I live my life in ruins for you
And for all your secrets kept
I squashed the blossom and the blossom's
Dead
Oh, give me a reason to beautiful
So sick in his body, so sick in his soul
Oh, and I will make myself so beautiful
Oh, and everything I am
Miles and miles of perfect skin
I swear I do, I fit right in
My love burns through everything
I cannot breathe
Miles and miles of perfect sin
I swear, I said, I fit right in
I fit right in your perfect skin
I cannot breathe
Hey, baby, take it all the way....down
Hey, baby, taste me anyway
Oh, you were born
So pretty oh summerbabe
We'll never know...
And fading like a rose
Give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body, just sell me your soul
I'll give you my body, just sell me your soul
Oh, and everything I am will be bought
And sold
Oh, and everything I am will turn hard
And cold
And they say in the end
You'll get bitter just like them
And they steal your heart away
When the fire goes out you better learn
To fake
It's better to rise than fade away...
Hey you were right
Named a star for your eyes
Did you freeze did you weep
Turn to gold, baby, sleep
Hey honey mine
I was there all the time
And I weep at your feet
And it rains and rains

Marble stairs in this cathedral
Built by these hands five hundred years before
We will make good men better
We will make good men better
Draw the right hand across the neck
Drop the arm down to your side.
I hear the voices calling in the night.
Thirty-three degrees
Accepted right of hypocrisy
From this bitter cup we all shall drink
Here I am awake, it's 2AM; it's getting late
All I know is something isn't right.
We will make good men better
How can you make good men better?
Draw the right hand across the neck
Drop the arm down to your side.
I hear the shadows calling in the night.
Get up, get up, get out
The fire's burning now
Our bodies burned to ashes
They'll be scattered to the forests.
Does it ever even faze you
That your father's involvement with a cult
Nearly killed your first born child?

Don't care
If 'n' you die
Ain't got no reason to cry
Don't feel
Don't need to
Your world ain't nothing to me
I'm fear
I'm your heretic
I'm doom waiting for the number
7 up 7
To the 6 on 6
Bring it on to me
And I'm tired of being alive
Spite of the bleeding
Bleeding light
And I'm tired of their bleeding light
Don't try to feed me
Full of your lies
No regrets
To bring me no tears
Never scared of things men fear
Never easy
Never clean
To be a beast among human sheep
I am fear
I am your heretic
I am your doom
Waiting for the number
7 on 7
To the 6 on 6
Bring it on to me
And I'm tired of being alive
Spite of the bleeding
Bleeding light
And I'm tired of their bleeding light
Don't try to feed me
Full of your lies
And I'm tired of being alive
Spite of the bleeding
Bleeding light
And I'm tired of their bleeding light
Don't try to feed me
Full of your lies
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm tired
Tired of their bleeding
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around

That ever bossed the world around
I want to do it right
I want to do it right away
I want to do it right now
I want to do it right away
I want to do it now
Don't want to be a dancer in the Bolshoi Ballet
Don't want to work for daddy
In daddy's shop, 0K
I get confused, so confused
I get a pain, I get a pain up here in the Shirley Temples
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it

Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Sssh, not too loud, don't tell everybody
Don't give away the game
Oh, I ain't quite ready to reveal my campaign
This is not the time
My hero's are alive and well in a cave
I'm keeping them on ice in suspended animation
Till the very right occasion comes along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
A Brave new world will rise from the ashes
And there upon a rock titanic
I'll cast a giant shadow on the face of the deep
And never again will they dare to call me
A freckled, spotty, specky, four eyed, weedy, little creep
No more tremblin' and quakin' in the gym
No more come on fellas, let's get him
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Little by little, ooh, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Bit by bit, bit by bit
Everyone's going to be free
But they'll have to agree to be free
They'll have to agree to be less free than me
'Cause I rule the world you see
So wait for the army of kiddy-winkies
And terrible tiny tots
In armored school buses
Firing poison pea-shooters
And sinking their milk teeth into your thighs
Delapsus resurgam when I fall I shall rise
I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around
I want to be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around

Weekend insomniacs
They can't get cigarettes at 3am
Broken bottles and crooked glass
With late night introspection
I'm so sick
I'm so sick
Sick of the neighborhood
As I should (You would)
The tube top wearin' table top servin' late night waitress
Smells of burnt coffee and black pen ink
This town, yeah this whole town
It ain't go no innocence left savin'
I'm so sick
I'm so sick
Sick of the neighborhood
As I should (You would)
I'm so sick of the street lights, the bar fights
The street lights, the bar fights
I'm so sick I'm so sick
Sick of the neighborhood
Yeah you would

When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting on death row
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of the harder they come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shoot us
But oh-the guns of Brixton
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shoot us
But oh-the guns of Brixton
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game is called survivin'
As in heaven as in hell
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

Raise up your hands
And put a smile on your face
I'm talking to everyone
In the human race
We're proud and strong
So stand up tall
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
There's a train of love
Beginning right here
So jump on to it
And have no fear
It's yours, it's mine
We got the call
Let's all get together
And bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Every man and woman
Boy and girl
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Shelter the homeless
Open your door
Feed the hungry
Give to the poor
Offer your heart
Don't think small
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Every man and woman
Boy and girl

long blind kiss from the beauty queen
daddy said I'm dancing on a mine
but if I ruled the world
if I was made king
watch me play for joker all the time
honesty... outshine
it breaks the mass
fear comes through with all it's hell
out here in the dark I play it cool
what do you want from me?
out here in the dark I play the fool
I'm restless in a world where all the eyes are meant to see
I'm restless in a world with all the shiny jewellery
I'm restless in a world where all the lies are meant to be

Eyes of celibates, burning images worn down rotted lies
Lips dried peeling, eyes separate our lives dead underneath your skin
This blood's not mine, you fucking whore, you don't deserve my gods
You're a deified angel, you leave me sickened in prayer
It's the residing disease in me that sheds its halos for whores
It leaves my wrists cut with jaded tongues
Your eyes freeze my fire of innocence, whores addictions, souls salvation
I said it, I'm so tired, so saddened, I'm no coward
Please bury me, they broke my wings in an attempt
To divide a sickness from comfort of open wounds
Wide eyed I died

esme could you shut the door
and put the oil lamp on the floor
i feel it coming on again
just like it did on saturday
voices after murder park
in the damp in the dark
maybe we should call the law
maybe we should call the child's parents
i'll love you until the end
hi, hello, what have you seen?
god, it's good to hear your voice again
did you miss your brother
darling i will always love you
lying, in a shallow grave
there's a church nearby and a railway
on a bed of mud and wire
esme find out where the child is buried
marry the first born
bury the stillborn
i love you and i always will
we are lying here
waiting to be buried
we are lying here and you're losing
contact with the dead
please don't ask about the future
i am not a fortune teller
i know you're just being civil
but don't make this trivial
uncles i have never seen
only in my own dead dream
on a bed of mud and wire
esme find out where the child is buried
i'll love you until the end

Creative movements
Some say they're destructive
A way of self expression
Now give me some soulfull rock
Without hesitation
As I walk through the street art gallery
The colours are like a blessing for me
The concrete has captured, and left space
Can't disarm the bomb and it's a colourfull victory
City of variety
Is there any place for me
Can't stop a way of living
Down on multiple street
Is there any place for me
The boys and girls are singin'
The will the message
And a request for something to do
Watch the movement
It attracts the fighting few
There's fear in their eyes
Fear of something new
Fear of the conviction, of me and you

oh wendy o how i loved you. your leather skin never looked so dry. you pissed me off, you had to split. you could've surfed our bus then died. wendy lost control. sex lock and load. oh wendy oh how i loved you. your leather skin never looked so dry. a rhino cunt a gun and perfect tim. you were kinda cool but you were no slimestra hymn. wendy lost control. death consumed her soul. oh wendy o how i loved you. your leather skin never looked so dry. you pissed me off, you had to split. you could've surfed our bus then died. wendy lost control. sex lock and load. wendy lost control. death consumed her soul.

One to another
Sister and a brother
Changing the way that you feel
Pleased to meet you
Hope I never see you
I'll be at ease watchin' you sleep watchin' you smile
Love I adore you
Always lookin' for you
And I'll be there whenever you need me
Be my Spiderwoman I'll be your Spiderman
I hear our day is comin'
Grows sweeter every year
Tomorrow could be too easy
And today's goin' to be too near
Justice for believers and love can keep the faith
I don't need you I can't buy you I can't hurt you
One to another
Peace to my brother
Always giving me his thing for free
Sad to knock you
Its good to rock you

Gets sweeter every year
Tomorrow's gonna be too easy
And today's gonna be too near
Trust is for believers and love can keep the faith
I don't need you I can't buy you I can't hurt you
Stand by my accusations
I'll come clean I don't need no vice
I know you want to keep me waitin'
I think its funny that you might
Love is hard to leave
And it's hard to never have
Can you please crawl out of your window
You can play with all my love
Yeah yeah yeah
Box up all our records
And a head full of ideas
And a hand full of escape routes
They're going to burn you

You got your hands in my pockets
You're whisperin' lies in my ear
Such promiscuous intentions
Don't mistake me for someone who cares
There were times I fooled myself, yeah
Thinkin' I was no one else
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I could do, yeah
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, that's right
True, yes, it's true
Such a restless condition
The way you're turnin' it on
Love 'em, tease 'em, for all the wrong reasons
You know you're such a bore
There were times I told myself
There was really no one else
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, it's true, baby
True, yes, it's true, look out
Is it some kind of shakedown
You know I really don't care
But you push it too hard, girl,
Yeah, you know it's just not fair
There were times I fooled myself
Thinkin' there was no one else
Hard days, cold nights
There's nothin' that I could do
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, true
Come on, come on, come on
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, yes, yes, it's true
Hard days, cold nights
Oh, there's nothin' that I could do, yeah
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, yes, it's true

So you did what you thought was right
Oh giving up the fight
The only way that we knew was wrong
Got me hanging on and on
It?s everything you want
Everything you need
And the people who counted on
Let you down one by one
So be sure what you?re asking for
Telephone don?t ring no more
It?s everything you want
Everything you need
Ooh in the right crowd
Face down in the right town
No good uptown
But maybe somehow
We?ll get back home
Don?t care who walks through the door
The life I paid twice for
Rearranging the furniture
It reminds me of who you were
It?s everything you want
Everything you need
Ooh in the right crowd
Face down in the right town
No good uptown
But maybe somehow
Ooh in the right crowd
Face down in the right town
No good uptown
But maybe somehow
We?ll get back home
We?ll get back home
We?ll get back home
We?ll get back home

Good morning america, you're my favorite t. v. show
Slow down now, I've a headache,
Sometimes it's hard to think,
The phone rings how are you? oh! I'm not up to much
You don't say, oh really! it'll end.... end in tears
Here I go again,
All I have is what I might have been
Where's my long lost friends?
Somewhere over the rainbow
When the dark clouds come,
The angel valium will call
To take me far away,
To a place where I don't have to feel
I'm happy as I hoover, it's one o'clock, time for lunch
Marshmallows with coffee,
Can't forget my slimfast drink,
The garden's depressing, I think I need a hair-do
A gin and a tonic, ah! that should do the trick
Here I go again,
All I have is what I might have been
Where's my long lost friends?
Somewhere over the rainbow
When the dark clouds come,
The angel valium will call
To take me far away,
To a place where I don't have to feel
It's monday afternoon, the kids are off at school
Sunset boulevard, the channel four matinee
Sit down, relax with a nice cup of tea....
.... oh! the sweet smell of butane.... and humdrum.
.... gloria swanson.... from here to eternity....

When you were young
And your excitement showed
But as time goes by,
Is it outgrown?
Is that the way things go?
Forever reaching for the gold
Forever fades black
And comes up cold
Walking free.
Come with me.
Far away.
Everyday.
Walking free.
Come with me.
Far away.
Everyday.
When you were young,
You never knew which way you'd go
What it was once grace now undertows
Well everyday do what you can
And if you let them turn you 'round
Whatever goes up must come down

Would you do that
If it really meant
They would see you
And would be convinced
That you love me
And you didn't care
Who knew it?
Please believe me
When I say it's true
I have never felt
As close to you, or anyone
As I do right now
And I'm begging you
Please don't leave yet
And this moment's glass
In a fragile state
I've convinced myself
That it won't crack or break
Like a heart
In the winter
When the air is cold
And your words, the same
I know them, I know them
I am broken, I am wounded
Watch as my fragile frame collapses
Collapses on me, on me
But it's not your fault
You never meant to hurt me
You hurt
And when it's five a.m.
And you're too tired to ever sleep
Well there's no rest for the lonely
I hope I die in my sleep
There's never been
Such hopelessness
Or devotion, or devotion
Or devotion, what's devotion?

A night turns to daylight
Daylight brakes you
You feel lost and lonely
Your thoughts betrayed you
It isn't the first time
It won't be the last
This crushed up feeling
Has a place on my crime
Close your eyes
The curtains that you like
Push them away, it's ok
Kill the day
And day turns to nighttime
And the nighttime makes you
You use a playwright pony
Your thoughts remake you
It isn't the first time
It won't be the last
This crushed up feeling
Has a place on my crime
Close your eyes
The curtains that you like
Push them away, it's ok
Kill the day
Close your eyes
The curtains that you like
Push them away, it's ok
Kill the day
Hates you
Brakes you
Hates you
Brakes you
Close your eyes
The curtains that you like
Push them away, it's ok
Kill the day
Close your eyes
The curtains that you like
Push them away, it's ok
Kill the day
Close your eyes
The curtains that you like
Push them away, it's ok
Kill the day

You feel the waves as they begin
To crash and wash your life away
It strapped you down
And made you a slave to the taste
You've messed it up
Made a mistake
And now I think it's time to pay
For all the promises you start to break, yeah
In these flames you've burned us alive now
You could've been someone
In these flames you've burned us alive now
Now you've left your impression
I, I think it's coming back again
And I can't fake the way I feel inside
I don't want you, I don't need you
You burned me once but you won't burn me again, yeah
You motherfucker, you've lost all you loved
And all the friends you've made
I picked you up
Gave you another chance to waste
You point your finger at me
But you still won't
Assume any blame
You, think your conspiracy's lead you astray, yeah
In these flames you've burned us alive now
You could've been someone
In these flames you've burned us alive now
Now you've left your impression
I, I think it's coming back again
And I can't fake the way I feel inside
I don't want you, I don't need you
You burned me once but you won't burn me again, yeah
Your misery tears away
At your lungs
With its sharpest teeth
Your misery has got you down now
You can't come crawling back
Now running your mouth
Sick of all the games
All of those years they seem like yesterday, yeah
In these flames you've burned us alive now
You could've been someone
In these flames you've burned us alive now
Now you've left your impression
I, I think it's coming back again
And I can't fake the way I feel inside
I don't want you, I don't need you
You burned me once but you won't burn me again, yeah

Turn to my eyes so I may steal you
Snatching such a vision burns a shape into me
Yet another hole, yet another hole
In this infested soul, in this infested soul.
Could I keep you, keep you, keep you
Keep you here in my pocket or I would bring you out and show around?
Not too much, not too much,
oh let it rain, oh let it rain,
oh let it rain, wow! Let it rain!
And maybe in time I could change
And I would die to be you
and I would kill to be good
Until then, let's be eye to eye to eye to eye to eye
So say a spell, so say a spell!

I was out on the west coast trying to make a buck
Things didn't work out I was kinda down on my luck
Got tired of roaming and bumming around
So I started thumbing back east toward my hometown
Made a lot of miles the first two days
I figured I'd be home in a week if my luck held this way
But the third night I got stranded way outside of town
At a cold lonely crossroad rain was pouring down
I was hungry and I was freezing done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord I was sure glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab where I knew it would be warm
At the wheel there sat a big man he weighed about 2-10
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
Big Joe's the name I told him mine
He said the name of my rig's Phantom 309
I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said son this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't no driver or a rig running any line
That's seen nothing but tail lights from Phantom 309
We rode and talked the best part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said I'm sorry son this is as far as you go
Cause I gotta make another turn just on up the road
He tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said have yourself a hot cup old Big Joe
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothing flat he was clean out of sight
I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was setting me up
You could've heard a pin drop
It got deathly quiet and the waiter face turned kinda white
Did I say something wrong I said with a half way grin
He said no this happens every now and then
Every driver in here knows Big Joe
But son let me tell you what happened bout ten years ago
At the crossroads tonight where you flagged him down
There was a bus full of kids a comin' from town
They were right in the middle when Joe tapped the hill
It could have been slaughter but he turned his wheels
Joe lost control went into a skid
Gave his own life to save that bunch of kids
And there at the crossroads was the end of the line
For Big Joe and Phantom 309
But every now and then some hiker will come by
And like you Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here have another cup and forget about that dime
Keep it as a souvenir from Big Joe and Phantom 309

The train now standing on platform four
What will you do when the gas taps turn?
Where will you be when the bodies burn?
Will you just watch as the cattle trucks roll by?
Pretend it isn't happening? Turn a blind eye?
See the army convoys quietly passing by?
Heard the helicopters in your little bit of sky?
Have you seen the squad cars packed with boys in blue?
Have you ever wondered what they're there to do?
Pictures in the paper of soldiers in the street
Pictures in the history books of rotting human meat
Auschwitz's now a tourist spot for the goggle eyed to pry
Still in working order just for you and I
Photos of the victims, of gas, of gun, of bomb
Inheritance of violence in the bookshelves of your home
Don't wait for it to come to you, cos come it surely will
The guardians of the state are trained to search, destroy and kill
There's people sitting at this moment, fingers on the trigger
There's loyalty and royalty to make their violence figure
Allegiance to the flag, they say, as they lock the prison door
Allegiance to normality, that's what lobotomies are for
God, queen and country, they say we've got the choice
Free speech for all if you've got no voice
Propaganda on the airwaves, here's the way to live
Not for you and me the alternative
The look for peace in Ireland with a thousand squaddy boys
Torture in their mental homes is another of their ploys
They'll keep us all in line, by christ, they'll keep us on our toes
But if we stand against their power, we'll see how violence grows
Read it in the paper about rebellious youth
But it's them that are so violent, it's them that hide the truth
Stay in line, or pay the cost,
Do you think they care when another life's lost?
Auschwitz's now a tourist spot for the goggle eyed to pry
Still in working order just for you and I
To ashes at Auschwitz it's just a small leap
From coshes at Southall, life is cheap
Don't think that they won't do it, cos they already do
But this time 'round the pawns are me and you

Cornered again
I've backed my self in and I'm fresh out of time
Too much to deal with lately
I feel like I'm juggling knives
I'm predisposed to be composed
But not of late and no time soon
My list it grows by rows and rows
And leads me to an early tomb
Light in my eyes, I'm paralyzed
I've had all I can take
If we get one more drop of rain
This levy is gonna break
I've arranged priorities
Conversely to what I need
In haste I grab a plate
And fill it with things I hate
Cornered again
I've backed my self in and I'm fresh out of time
Too much to deal with lately
I feel like I'm juggling knives
I'm burning midnight oil
Or wicks but at both ends
And now the choice is
Juggling 9 or dropping 10
Light in my eyes, I'm paralyzed
I've had all I can take
If we get one more drop of rain
This levy is gonna break
I'm burning midnight oil
Or wicks but at both ends
And now the choice is
Juggling 9 or dropping 10
Light in my eyes, I'm paralyzed
I've had all I can take
If we get one more drop of rain
This levy is gonna break
This levy is gonna break
This levy is gonna break
This levy is gonna break
This levy is gonna break
This levy is gonna break
This levy is gonna break

With a pistol in both hands
He walked in like he had a plan
Had the eyes of a dead man
Never seen such a blood fan
Bodies twitching while ears ring
Biding time while my heart stings
Got twelve souls, sure of nothing
Wait and see what hell brings
Two tears in a bucket
The river runs red
Two tears in a bucket
Always fear for the undead
Always fear what I said

I'm a rolling thunder, a pouring rain
I'm comin' on like a hurricane
My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're gonna die
I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you
Hell's bells
Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringing hell's bells
My temperature's high, hell's bells
I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing as I split the night
Cause if good's on the left,
Then I'm stickin' to the right
I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you
Hell's bells
Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringing hell's bells
My temperature's high, hell's bells
Yeow
Hell's bells, Satan's comin' to you
Hell's bells, he's ringing them now
Hell's bells, the temperature's high
Hell's bells, across the sky
Hell's bells, they're takin' you down
Hell's bells, they're draggin' you around
Hell's bells, gonna split the night
Hell's bells, there's no way to fight, yeah
Ow, ow, ow, ow
Hell's bells

One thing or another's always getting in the way
Of this and it's what we do, of this and it's what we do
Wasting time and money's so much sicker than you think
Especially when it's you, especially when it's you
Stopping all the clocks, I'm trying not to think about time
It's all a game of number and who says that they won't lie?
Look at what they made us do, look at what they made us do
How can you be abstract if you're always on the brink
Of finding out something new, finding out something new
I'm taking off my watch
I'm trying not to think about time
First thing it's the money, after a while it's my health,
My health, my health, my health, my health
Nights and days and hours doesn't seem to be much help,
Much help, much help, much help, much help
You need to sort this problem out,
It's going to take a while, gonna take a while
One thing or another's always getting in the way
Getting in the way, getting in the way
Spending time and money's so much quicker than you think
Quicker than you think, quicker than you think
It's all a game of number and who says that they won't lie?
They won't lie
How can you be abstract if you're always on the brink
Of finding something new, finding something new
There's no time time, there's no time time
First thing it's the money, after a while it's my health,
My health, my health, my health, my health
Nights and days and hours doesn't seem to be much help,
Much help, much help, much help, much help
You need to sort this problem out,
It's going to take a while, gonna take a while

Time it goes on
Waits for nobody special
In the prime of my years I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving
But I can't hold you woman
No piece of you
You were the magic
My only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dyin' day
Now is now
We capture the world
And our love will make it all right, all right
Time it goes on
Waits for nothing or no one
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman eternally
Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I've been a no one
Standing in the cold dark waiting for your love
Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love
Turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now
We master the world
In time we'll make it all right, all right
Time is time
Don't give me no wrong
Don't give me no wrong

I long to taste adventure like the nature of the sea
Always moving, always hiding, all the creatures from beneath
Singing silent songs of sadness, my heart waits for its chance
To dance upon the ashes of my burned up little plans
And I stand alone before the night
My nakedness is so clear in the glow of the moonlight
Life is old but so short
We are young, we want more
I'm drowning but I don't care
Because when you got what I got, what I got
Who needs air? I don't need air
My addiction too danger like the rush of the sea
Like a wave on the rocks, the lessons crash down on me
I don't need to prove the world to you, only to myself
So step back, look away as I dive into the swell
I'm drowning but I don't care
Because when you got what I got, what I got
Who needs air?
So take me down to the river like a little child
And take my hand and tell me it's okay to be wild
I never knew the world until I saw through your eyes
I never knew myself until I ripped off my disguise
I'm drowning but I don't care
Because when you got what I got, what I got
Who needs air?
I'm drowning
(I have come to the realization that)
But I don't care
(Life is more than what I have accomplished and)
Because when you got what I got, what I got
(Life is more then the realization that)
Who needs air?
(We have accomplished nothing at all)
I'm drowning
(True success is so selfless so drown in the)
But I don't care
(Lyrics of your life and give up the air that you breathe)
Because when you got what I got, what I got
(You don't need anything)
I don't need air
(You don't need anything)
I don't need air

Cold nights in the city can turn a heart to stone,
I'm still cryin' and you know why I'm out here on my own.
Being here without you, it takes up all my time,
I'm tryin' to forget you, but you're still on my mind.
And I don't wanna tear you down, but I'm the only fool around.
You know I'm here on shaky ground, but I don't wanna tear you down.
I'm in a crowd of people, on this uneasy street,
I'm walking blind 'til I can't see what your love done to me.
And I don't wanna tear you down, but I'm the only fool around.
You know I'm here on shaky ground, but I don't wanna tear you down.
I don't wanna tear you down, but I'm the only fool around.
You know I'm here on shaky ground, but I don't wanna tear you down.
{Instrumental}
Just a temporary pleasure, caused a never-ending pain,
But if love could last forever, then we're sure to love again, love again.
And I don't wanna tear you down, but I'm the only fool around.
You know I'm here on shaky ground, but I don't wanna tear you down.
{Instrumental}
I don't wanna tear you down, but I'm the only fool around.
You know I'm here on shaky ground, but I don't wanna tear you down.
I don't wanna tear you down, but I'm the only fool around.
You know I'm here on shaky ground, I don't wanna - I don't wanna tear you down.

Oh, oh, oh
Why would you pay to see me in a cage?
And why would you pay to see me in a cage?
Some men call the stage
Listen now I have gone
You will know
I was the only one that would have died
What was wrong in the eyes of the unwell and unwise
And I killed a man for his giro today
Wasn't very gay, I didn't mind
I was a money man anyway
Killed a man for his giro today
Why, would you pay
Why, would you pay
To see me in a cage
It's all across the stage
And know
When the night has come
You might say
I was not the only the one who would've died
What was wrong in the eyes of the cruel and unwise
And I killed a man for his giro today
On the off chance that you're listening '
To the radio
I thought you might like to know you broke my heart
Can only sadden up or hedge your bets
Or take a chance and never get you again
All my ties, time and time
I keep on trying hard not to try too hard
When I forgive, I won't forget
To killing time, so I'm better now
I don't need it...
Anything that makes you, feel hate
Can do without hate
Now I believe in love
Now I have gone
Oh yeah, I will pay
For everything you've done
What was wrong
In the eyes of the unwell and unwise
And I killed a man for his giro today
Oh, oh, oh

Guess I'm filled with the Christmas spirit
Celebrate a jolly man in red
Hope my kids don't find out Santa Clause isn't real
Maybe I should have told them about Jesus instead
Last time I heard about it.
He didn't come in a Santa outfit (two times)
Santa Clause is dead! (two Times
Guess it's time to thank the Easter bunny again
For doing absolutely nothing in my life
What the heck do a bunch of colored eggs
have to do with the Son of God being raised back to life
Last time I heard about it,
He didn't rise in an Easter outfit (Twice)
The Easter bunny is dead! (Twice)
Christmas is when I celebrate Jesus' birth
Easter's when I celebrate Jesus' resurrection
Jesus is alive! (Twice)
If we are so worried about what our kids are going to grow up doing, if we are so worried about our kids growing up and getting on drugs and having premarital sex and getting sexually transmitted diseases, and instead of standing around the Christmas tree and wondering if Santa brought them a present why don't we start telling them about how Jesus Christ died for them how He was born from a virgin named Mary, how He was dead for three days and how He rose again. And how the only way they are going to have eternal life is through His blood. And if they accept Him that they'll go to Heaven. If we start telling our kids about that and maybe we won't have to worry about all this violence going on in the world and maybe we won't have to worry about all our problems as being parents and divorce, maybe we won't have to worry about anything. Why don't we just tell them about Jesus and it might solve some stuff!

Don't you shut your eyes
Don't hide your heart behind a shadow
'Cause you can count on me as long as I can breathe you should know
I'll carry you through the night, through the storm
Give you love only love in return
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I would take one for you
Be sure I would
I've fallen from grace yeah I'm much less a saint than a sinner
No ain't no superhuman cause that's just in the movies
I know
But I'll carry you through the night, through the storm
Give you love always love in return
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet I'm no hero
But I would take one for you
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I'd spill my blood for you
If you need me to I'll be there
Yeah yeah...
Uh...uh uh uh uh...
Don't say this is over
Look at them better days
Oh don't say this is over
There's no loser
Look at them better days
And try again!
I can't jump over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet I'm no hero
But I would take one for you
I can't JUMP over buildings I'm no hero
But love can do miracles
I can't outrun a bullet cause I'm no hero
But I'd spill my blood for you
If you need me to I'll be there
Yeah yeah...

Well I've done things I'm not proud of
Broken all the rules of lve
Sentenced five and doin' ten once again
Of all the damage done
It would've been easy just to run
But I stood by and showed my hand like a man
[CHORUS: ]
And I've paid the price for some doghouse rights
Better wake up (wake up)
Let me back in or let me go
Once I was king, kept a black book on a string
But that's changed and rightful too
Since I met you
Oh a brand new man that's what you want (that's what you want)
That's what I am
And baby from this day on (this day on)
I won't smoke or drink or stay out late
You can tell all my friends I moved away
Wake up (wake up) let this fool back in or let me go
Wake up, let this fool back in or let me go.

aint going back to black boy lane,
No I aint going back to black boy lane,
There must be some other way,
Because I aint going back to black boy lane,
Never again...
Do you think you can help?
Can't you make me a call?
We're so near to town,
I can't get nothing at all
Today, are you dancing today?
15 Track-suits coming up my lane,
15 Track-suits coming up my lane,
..................,
There's the men; the ones you must lay,
In which you must lay down and die,
Oh as opposed to strutting all day,
Strutting all night,
Strutting on 'brown,'
Strutting on 'white,'
All day,
Are you dancing today?
Ah there's a bullet there with my name,
So I aint going back to black boy lane,
Never, never again,
What about the fella you knew from sometime before,
In the house by the park with a cage on the door,
You phone and you say, are you dancing today?
Are we dancing today?

I call ya...
You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where've you been
Ooh, baby, let it on the line
This is last call, you say that's all
You can take it fine
I'm sorry but...
It don't make sense
You're pullin' just right out on first offense
Ooh, baby, play it smart
For you go south with your big mouth
Let it take your heart...
Danger, there's a breakdown dead ahead
Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down...
I told ya
No more lyin'
No more tears fallin'
Stop your cryin'
Ooh, baby, I'm your fan
Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand...
Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
Just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Danger, there's a breakdown dead ahead
Then just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down, down, down, down...
No, no, no...

Ev'ry day I'm gonna strut that stuff.
When the music's loud I can't get enough.
Singin' hi, singin' hi,
Come on feet, teach yourself to move.
People shuff'lin' up and down again.
Unhappy faces ain't gonna get you in.
Singin' hi, singin' hi,
Come on people, teach yourself to move.
Hey, hey! hey, all right!
Spread the news, we're goin' have some fun.
Let it go, movin' son-of-a-gun.
Singin' hi, signin' hi,
Come on feet, we was born to move.

With a hundred and eighty miles
You can press my button and see
Faster than a mach 5 I can make you bleed
I'm self-undercover you wont even know I'm there
I can kill all of you you better beware
[Chorus]
Its the dawn of the new future weapon
I'm after your soul [Repeat: x2]
Its the prime speed and violence of action
I'm at the controls
Yes at the controls
Higher than a mile
My weaponology
I can take you out there
With pin point accuracy
Riding in a raptor
Danger to the max
Shoot if you flying by
With the power of my attack
[Chorus]
Living in this present
Living this lie
The air you breathe is a poisonous fire
The sounds you hear destroy the tune
The sounds you hear destroy...
With a hundred and eighty miles
You can press my button and see
Faster than a mach 5 I can make you bleed
[Chorus: x2]
[Repeat: x2]
I'm at the controls
I'm after your soul

The Atlantic was born today, and I'll tell you how
The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no islands should go (oh no)
Most people were overjoyed they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your
Door have been silenced forevermore
And the distance is quite simply much to far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before (oh no)
(I need you so much closer)
(I need you so much closer)

As I fall I leave a scar upon the sky
A simple note for you I wait for your reply
And in your answer I regain the will to to try
[Chorus]
Hover in the diving light
We will rip the night
Out of the arms of the sun
One more time
Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the crowded sky
And over the dumbstruck world we will run
In these hills they wash the gold and graves away
To the valley under all of this I lay
And there you dig me out, unearthed and saved
[Chorus]
We can rip the night out of the arms of the sun
A blood red feather leaves a scar upon my hand
No longer stranded like a painted bird on a fan
[Chorus]
We can rip the night out of the arms of the sun [Repeat: x3]

The day has gone and Im still here
On my bed thinkin with folded hands
Yesterday was a bad day
Tomorrow how will it be?
Waste of time come out of me
Too bored to die let me come in
Waste of time come out of me
Too bored to die
I can only submit myself
Tired and old youll find me with blonde locks of a doll
Cover my eyes so I dont suffer
Too bored to die I hate myself
Waste of time, too bored to die
Waste of time, too bored to die

Why do we always end up like this?
The same position on the couch
Staring into each other's eyes
But do we have to talk about this now
And do I have to feel like crying?
Because I
I don't want to run
And don't come back again
We could have avoided this
Five desperate hours pass
And now we know the truth
That I can't learn to love you
So desperate I can taste it
Wishing things were different
But still I cannot change
Run, and don't look back again
There's nothing left to see
These empty months have proved
My inability to treat you like you deserve to be treated
But then you can't expect me to change who I am

Oh baby baby
Oh baby baby
Oh baby baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me
How you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'cause I need to know now, oh because
My lonliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Oh baby baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it
Show me
How you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'cause I need to know now, oh because
My lonliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Oh baby baby
Oh baby baby
Oh baby baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess
That my lonliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My lonliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My lonliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

(Hey, I know who you are, but you don't know me)
(Ha ha ha!)
Talkin' a lotta shit
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that)
Got a lotta shit on my mind
(I know that guy, man)
(That's the guy, man)
Got some bad feelings on me
(Ha ha ha!)
(I know that guy)
(Yea, he's going to your seat, man)
(Come to me, sorry to me, man)
(I make a problem for you my friend)
Fast, fast people coming to my house
(Ha ha ha!)
(I know man, make a problem very quick, very quick!)
(Ha ha ha!)
Telling me things I already know
(Woo!)
Some bad shit
Don't wanna touch it
It's like big, empty city
Full of toasters
Bad energy

You know by now that I've been passed
Through an awful lot of hands
And all I have is what is left
From ten thousand one night stands
Sometimes I feel like I was there
When the blues began
With this crying guitar holding me
Like a woman holds a man
[Chorus]
Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh, I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer
At night sometimes I can still feel
Every place I've ever been
I feel it in my music
And it all comes back again
You know I've played for city lights
And for stars above
And every note I ever play
I always play for love
[Chorus]

I finally broke into the prison,
I found my place in the chain.
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows,
All the brave young men
They're waiting now to see a signal
Which some killer will be lighting for pay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray.
I fought in the old revolution
On the side of the ghost and the King.
Of course I was very young
And I thought that we were winning;
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
As they carry the bodies away.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
Lately you've started to stutter
As though you had nothing to say.
To all of my architects let me be traitor.
Now let me say I myself gave the order
To sleep and to search and to destroy.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
Yes, you who are broken by power,
You who are absent all day,
You who are kings for the sake of your children's story,
The hand of your beggar is burdened down with money,
The hand of your lover is clay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture

We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Right on time here's the other shoe.
Clouds overhead start to loom.
Some born to win others fated to lose.
From options we must choose.
My friend dread is right on time, can't start to think that it is fine
Watch the tower as it starts to teeter.
New lyrics follow the same old meter.
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall.
We're dying on the inside.
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Butterflies, my stomach starts to heave.
What joyous blunder waits for me?
Finished first but I missed the start.
Hitched the mule behind the cart.
Take the rose by the thorns.
Hope for sun, but here's the storm.
So head outside and wait for rain.
Watch it all go down the drain.
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall.
We're dying on the inside.
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
"We settle in but it's time to go, taken to sea by the undertow.
Love the smell but I hate the taste.
Feeling good is such a waste.
Loved the book but I hate the end, gained a lover but I lost a friend.
Straight to worst, from the best.
Nothing can fill that hole in my chest."
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about fall.
To make things worse, it all goes so fast and we try to hold on as they go past.
We need a Peter, we get a Paul; at least Judas had the balls.
To make a move on these building doubts about how this messiah thing would shake out,
"I feel the nail against my skin, wait for the hammer to drive it in."
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to fall.
"We're dying on the inside."
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to fall
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to fall
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside

I see you fading away from us
I'll miss you very much
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams
And pride still running high, always on your side
But I wanted more for you
You can't go on this way
And now I see it all fall through
We pray for better days
Stuck alone and scared
Throw your life away
And now choking on your pride
May be the only way
I don't want to see you like this
We all tried to save you but missed
I still feel the hope on your road
Now come back to us like the days of the old
I still feel you there, trying to get on top
You'll always have my support in my heart
People you've hurt
Friends that you've lied to
But we understand, and that's not you can see the end of the road
I can see it too, for you, I'm scared if I lose you, I'm not prepared
This time, if you die
I watch you, right before my eyes
Just trust me, and listen
You have no self control
This will take your life
Overdose and then indulge until you die
Pondering, we all ask the question why
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad
And we are left the only family that you've ever had
Overdose and then indulge until you die
Pondering, we all ask the question why
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad
And we are left the only family that you've ever had
But I wanted more for you
You can't go on this way
And now I see it all fall through
We pray for better days
Stuck alone and scared
Throw your life away
And now choking on your pride
May be the only way
Help you see it through
Fight this, me and you
Reaching deep inside
Problems not just you is what we find
Our friendship makes it mine

"Take the Skinheads Bowling"
by Camper Van Beethoveen
from Telephone Free Landslide Victory
Everyday I get up and pray to Jah
And he increases the number of clocks by exactly one
Everybody's coming home for lunch these days
Last night there were skinheads on my lawn
Chorus: Take the skinheads bowling, take them bowling.
Take the skinheads bowling, take them bowling.
Some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes (got big lanes X 2)
Some people say that bowling alleys all look the same (look the same X 2)
There's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything (anything X 2)
Had a dream last night but i forget what it was (what it was X 2)
(chorus)
Had a dream last night about you my friend
Had a dream I wanted to sleep next to plastic
Had a dream I wanted to lick your knees
Had a dream about nothing
(chorus)
(chorus)

They all know me by my car
They all know I'm gone, but not how far
I'm heading straight down 101
I'm going to go and get me some
My lips are movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
Eu não posso dirigir
E agora aparece
Meu dedo enterrado
No meu nariz
My lips are movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down

Lovers keep on the road your on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, were gonna get out
Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreamin' of the Osaka sun
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Dreamin' of when the morning comes
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun will come out
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load
Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love
Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the reign of love
Reign of love
By the church, we?re waiting
Reign of love
My knees go praying
How I wish
I'd spoken up
Or we'd be carried
In the reign of love

When I hold you in my gaze
When there's nothing else to say
I can still find you when you look away
You can say to me we're through
You can say that you are free
But you fool yourself
You belong to me
The more you want to run
You can't make it to the door
Took a chance on love
Now we both want more
And tonight goes on forever
I can feel it in my life
I can see it in your eyes
Going through this world together
Finding paradise with you
Into the savage blue
The savage blue with you
When the storm has passed us by
And the crowd has come and gone
I will be with you
Cause our love goes on
And we share a quiet place
That no one else can touch
Spirits live as one
And our souls are free
I will wait for you
Now my heart's an open door
Tell me that you'll stay
Don't want to lose you anymore
And tonight goes on forever
I can feel it in my life
I can see it in your eyes
Going through this world together
Finding paradise with you
Into the savage blue
Baby come with me
And tonight goes on forever
I can feel it in my life
I can see it in your eyes
Going through this world together
Finding paradise with you
Into the savage blue
(Tonight goes on forever)
When I'm alone with you
(Tonight we are together)
Oh yeah
(Tonight goes on forever)
Into the savage blue
(Tonight goes on forever)
When I'm alone with you
(Tonight we are together)
Makin' love to you
(Tonight goes on forever)
Into the savage blue
(Tonight goes on forever)
(Tonight we are together)
(Tonight goes on forever)
(Tonight goes on forever)
(Tonight we are together)
(Tonight goes on forever)
(Tonight goes on forever)
(Tonight we are together)
(Tonight goes on forever)

Telling me you don't want to be here
Had enough of life
I see your shoulders falling down the mountain
You once loved to climb
Don't you want to talk about it
Well saying there's no life left inside of you
[Chorus]
What about your loves
What about your dreams
What about the chanced to borrow dreams
What about the moonlight
What about the way you sign
When it touches you
On your knees in the teeth of failure
It's got you gag and bond
You say it's killing you
Well listen now I'm telling you
Your better days are to come
Set your sights on simple beauty
Like the way my eyes shine
When I'm around you
[Chorus]
Nobody said it would be easy
To take a fall and stand
Just wrap your arms tight around me
And we'll stumble together
Until we learn to dance

I walked twenty blocks to your favorite bakery
to pick you up a little treat
I know you're not an early riser
after a long night on your feet
And this pretty flower's called a "Saint Paulina"
It's grown in the African wild
Oh, baby just to see you smile
Baby just to see you smile
We could have ourselves a Sunday picnic
spread a blanket on the grass
I've got a brick of firecrackers
honey, let's see how long these babies last
Oh, there ought to be a law against this
tonight I'd put myself on trial
Oh, baby just to see you smile
Baby just to see you smile
Baby just to see you smile
I know you got it in you
Oh, what I wouldn't give you
Oh, baby
You've got the gift that keeps on giving
So baby, why you wanna keep it hide?
I've done so many things that I'm not proud of
Only you can make me feel like my old self again
And if the moon's the only light left shinning
I'd walk a thousand miles
Oh, baby just to see you smile
Baby just to see you smile
Baby just to see you smile
You know I've got to have it
Honey, you could stop the traffic

Naked Man, Naked Man
Passing through Naked Land
Naked Man, Naked Man
In the sand, where is your hand?
Naked Man, Naked Man
Please go back to Naked Land
Naked isn't a sometimes thing
Naked is an all time thing
It's not the size of the dog in the thing
It's the size on the thing in the dog
Naked on a Monday
Naked all year long
Naked is never right
Naked is always wrong
So get the hell away from me
You goddamn Naked Man
Go the fuck away from me
Back to Naked Land
Naked Man, Naked Man
Passing through Naked Land
Naked Man, Naked Man
In the sand, where is your hand?
Naked Man, Naked Man
Please go back to Naked Land
Naked Man in Denver
Naked past sleep
Naked isn't dirty
Naked isn't clean
Naked isn't fun
Naked isn't nice
Naked lasts forever
So roll those naked dice
Naked in the morning
Naked all night long
So Paul is a naked lady

In cases such as these I'd like a hand
Don't wake me up without a master plan
With silence I'm becoming fragile
Don't you understand?
When things that once were beautiful
Are bland
And when I feel like I can feel once again
Let me stay awhile
Soak it in awhile
If we can hold on we can fix what is wrong
Buy a little time
For this head of mine
Haven for us
In truth there is no better place to be
Than falling out of darkness still to see
Without a premonition
Could you tell me where we stand?
I'd hate to lose this light
Before we land
And when I feel like I can feel once again
Let me stay awhile
Soak it in awhile
If we can hold on we can fix what is wrong
Buy a little time
For this head of mine
Haven for us
Before we let euphoria
Convince us we are free
Remind us how we used to feel
Before when life was real
And when I feel like I can feel once again
Let me stay awhile
Soak it in awhile
If we can hold on we can fix what is wrong
Buy a little time
For this head of mine
Haven for us

Go, every time I go up, I eventually go down
But then I go back up and it seems like a round
I wish I could stay up all the day
But I know sometimes it wont go that way
What Im asking you is what should I do? What should I do?
Would you leave me if, when I fall to the ground?
Would you still love me every time I am down?
Would you help me up and put my all into you?
Because I want to do, what you want me to do
I am down, I am on my knees, be with me
And lift me up so high, to the sky and let me see
I know I want to be with, I want to be
I know I want to be, what you want me to be
He will never leave you
Would you leave me if, when I fall to the ground?
Would you still love me every time I am down?
Would you help me up and put my all into you?
Because I want to do, what you want me to do
Would you leave me if, when I fall to the ground?
Would you still love me every time I am down?
Would you help me up and put my all into you?
Because I want to do, what you want me to
Would you leave me if, when I fall to the ground?
Would you still love me every time I am down?
Would you help me up and put my all into you?
I want to do

It's not surprising
That you have all those wounds
They're advertising
The things that you've been through
It's tantalizing
To psychoanalyze
We're all downsizing
What we do with our lives
There's not enough money
In this whole world
To pay for a break or two
There's not enough armor in a suit of mail
Your broken skin's not black or blue
But damaged just the same
And who does not feel fractured too
Like broken skin
The sun's not rising
Upon your burned out shell
Still exercising
The things you don't do well
It's not enterprising
To grapple with the past
You're past surmising
How long the past can last
There's not enough trees
You can hide behind
Not enough walls to climb
Not enough cracks in the paving stones
Your broken skin's not black or blue
But damaged just the same
And who does not feel fractured too
Like broken skin

What's behind,
Your black door?
I wanna know,
I wanna know, yeah,
May take a week, honey,
It may take more,
I wanna know,
I wanna know,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh~oh,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh~oh,
Ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh,
Got to doubt,
Your condition,
I wanna know,
I wanna know,
It would end,
My suspicion, yeah,
I wanna know,
I wanna know,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh~oh,
Ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh,
Oh...oh,
When I see it,
Start to open,
Can't you hear me,
Beggin' please?
Ooh~ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh~ooh ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh,
Ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh,
Ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh~ooh,
Ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh~ahh.

Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time
Yea, you are the fortunate...
I've been looking for a way out
Something that isn't so cruel
Well I'm a little tired, you see
Complacent and miserable
I think you're missing out
I think you're dumbing it down
You're past the point of holding up to your words,
There's no getting it by us now
So if it's OK by you,
Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, 'Yea I'm alright'
You are the fortunate all the time
So full of this adventure
The feelings insecure
It's so easy, push the pin, fake the tense
And give us nothing more
And if it's OK by you,
Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time
And if it's the one thing
That I've been sure of,
Well its OK, I know you've got the time
If it's all one in the same thing
Then I've been waiting for the fallout with history
But it's got on for so long, for so long
That I don't think you'll ever be the same
Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time
Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yea I'm alright
You are the fortunate all the time
Hey (don't pay no mind)
Heyo heyyy (we are the second, you're minutes behind)
Heyo heyo heyyyo (So you say, 'Yea I'm alright')
Heyo Heyo Heyo (You are the fortunate all the time)

I need to wake up soon
So very soon
Into the light zone
Into the light
I`m falling forwards
And into sight
And running backwards
And falling down
They cheer they cheer
Under a piercing and
Blinding light
The crowd all gather
Singing
Right on right on
But there`s no dark corner
Only
Centre stage
The crowd gets restless
I begin to say
I don`t know if you know
I care I`m here
I`m only barely holding on
To something that is real
I`ll stand up to the noise and light
Until everything requires
I might be heard
Or else wake up
And dream
Dream
Dream
He`s so good looking
The traffic stops
He`s a politician
A heavenly cop
Words of healing
Fall from his lips
Lifting up the weak
Is in his gift
People say yeah
To the hall of office
And the foreign stage
Maybe at last
The world`s a
Better place
He`s brought down swiftly
By the
Hand of fate
The people weep
And the thought remains
When you fight for every breath
Do you stop to think about your friends or do you
Realise
That in that moment separating life and death
You want to take what you can get
And maybe
Only wake up
But not
Dream

You're telling everybody that she loves you
You know she don't
You're telling everybody that she'll come back
You know she won't.
You tell the same old story
To everybody else
And pretty soon you'll start
Believeing it yourself.
I know because she put me through it too
She gets around
And you got so much pride you won't admit
She turns you down.
So you'll stick to your story
I did the same thing too
And pretty soon you'll start
Believeing that it's true.
--- Instrumental ---
You say you're something special in her eyes
You know you're not
A mem'ry and a lotta foolish lies
That's all you've got.
But you say that she'll come back
I know just how you feel
And pretty soon you'll start
Believeing that she will.
But you're just asking for a broken heart
When you won't end
'Cause when you start believing your own lies
That's what you'll get.
So go tell everybody
She found someobody else
And maybe soon you'll
Start believeing it yourself...

I get by in a different way
I get by in this life in a different way
I get by in a different way.
I get high in a different way
I've got hope to cope with the everyday
I get high in a different way.
No other life will ever do
No other way can see me through
No other way.
I see things in a different way
I see color and life when there is gray
I see things in a different way.
I feel love in a different way
I've got hope to cope with the everyday
I feel love in a different way.
Looked at as one peculiar soul
Who prayed that God would not let go.
I get by in a different way
I've got something real.

When you see love
And you don't know what it is
You might find yourself in fear
To show your heart
But when you feel it
And it's oh, so wonderful
You might find yourself in fear
To let it part, in fear to let it part
So hold her closer when she cries
Hold her closer when she feels
She needs a hand to hold
Someone who'll never let her go again
And hold him closer when he tries
To hold the tears back from his eyes
Don't say goodbye
When your heart decides
That it's time to let it through
There's no reason to be scared
To open up
'Cause love may be blind
But all of us don't see it
So just once in your life
If you hear the knock of love
Just let it in
Hold her closer when she cries
Hold her closer when you know it's time to say goodbye
You hurry back to see her smile again
And hold him closer when he's down
When his world is upside down
Turn it around
So hold her closer when she cries
Hold her closer when she feels
She needs a hand to hold
Someone who'll never let her go again
And hold her closer when she's down
When her world is upside down
Turn it around
Hold her close

Spoken:
Rocka my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Let my people go deep into La La Land
I'm the pied piper with a 'lectronic baby grand
I'm gonna sell you a song
[piano intro]
I woke up when I got here
But I'm not really sure where I am
I see a piano
Beside it is standing a man, he says:
There are two kinds of stars here
The Dead and Alive
We want you to join them.
I wonder, which star am I?
The world is twisted
All of these rockstars are whores
Writing songs for commercials
So you go buy their shit in the stores
And I can't sleep
I can't sleep
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive

There's a banging in my head
Every day I'm seeing red
Feel I can do nothing at all 'til I break the chains
Tear down the wall
Too many people tell me what to do, what to think and say
Now it's time for me to do what I want
You better get out of my way
I'm moving out getting out of here
I can't waste anymore time
Pack my bags, tie my shoes before I lose my mind
You're standing, standing in my way
Well, don't say, I didn't tell you
No one hold me back
I'm gonna do some climbing
I'm pulling in the slack
Lots of things to see and do and none of them include you
I wrote your name on the bathroom wall
You won't be lonely
Everybody's gonna call
Aw, you better move
Too many people tell me what to do, what to think, and say
Now it's time for me to do what I want
You better get out of my way
I'm moving out, getting out of here
I can't waste anymore time
'Cause I know
It's all out there
And some of it is mine
Yeah, that's right
Better step aside
Yeah, move it over
Go on, get out of here

500 channels of a day-dream stimulation
Helps me to resent my life and raise my expectations
Locked into re-runs, your memories repeating
And all your ideals seem so self defeating
For you and yours, the Pepsi generation
And when you're discontent, you change the TV station
And when you hate your life, no qualities redeeming
A million brainwashed zombies will always be heard screaming
And when there is no hope
I'll smoke some crack, I'll shoot some dope
When theres no enemies, I sit and stare at my TV
And in my ignorance, I'll be a slave and sycophant
And in a perfect world devoid of all temptations
The good leftover crizack could unite the nations
But now the war machines are mapping our destructions
With poisons over flowing in the chemical seductions
And when there is no hope
I'll smoke some crack, I'll shoot some dope
When theres no enemies, I sit and stare at my TV
And in my ignorance, I'll be a slave and sycophant
With my credit and my bank, my mind will draw a blank
I'll block out history, and stare at my TV
For me there is no way
500 channels waste my life away, away

you failed me once again
but I fool believed in us
I asked myself a hundred times
is it you that I can trust
you're stripping the bark off me
I hold still speechlessly
strew salt in my open wounds
I still won't give up on you
beat me till I'm senseless
bleed me till I go dry
but I won't give up on you
we made it this far
what I feel is true
I can't understand this fight
that lasts so long
and I'm staying here
to prove you wrong
brainwashed by delusions
you are led away from truth
I bound up my wounds to leave
since you asked me not to go
you're stripping the bark off me
I hold still speechlessly
strew salt in my open wounds
beat me till I'm fearless
bleed me till I go dry
but I won't give up on you
we made it this far
what I feel is true
I can't understand this fight
that lasts so long
and I'm staying here
to prove I'm right
brainwashed by delusions
you are led away from truth
I bound up my wounds to leave
since you asked me not to go
I won't let go

I ain't no cowboy
I just look like one
And I ain't no prisoner
But I'm on the run from these chains
And I'm just between trains
I ain't no loner
I just work alone
There ain't no place
Where there's a home I could claim
And I'm still between trains
Still between trains
CHORUS
I've got to let it roll
I've got to let it ride
I can never show
What's really going on inside
If I'm too young to learn
Or too old to change
I guess I'll always be
Between trains
I ain't no soldier
But I've been to war
I done some killin'
All I kill anymore are these pains
And I'm just between trains
Just passin' through
Never stayed this long in one place
So when I'm gone just lay my remains
Somewhere between trains
Somewhere between trains
CHORUS

Raise your can of beer on high
And seal your fate forever
Our best years have past us by
The golden age of leather
This was the night not long to come in the year of our Lord A.D.
Where in a desert way-house, poised on the brink of eternity
Four and ninety studded horsemen closed the knot of honor
As only drunken soldiers can
And passed from man to man, a wanton child to dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed as nothing less than the end of
An age
A last crusade, a final outrage, in this day of flaccid plumage
And there was worn no cloth but leather
Made supple by years of stinging cinders
And here were seen the scars of age
For age had been the common call for one last night together
Down colored the sky (the ritual feast)
Some had died (they were buried with their bikes)
Each grabbed a rag (from a man with a sack)
Torn strips of color (the red and the black)
We made a vow to give it all we had to give
We made a vow to die as we had lived
They flew the colors, they began to fight
They flailed at each other like bugs at a light
Bodies and bikes beyond repair
Smell of oil and gas in the air
Then the wind whipped the desert with a giant hand
And the humans and the Harleys caught the shifting sand
And the old ranger weathered the storm
And he topped the rise by the middle of morn
He saw rippled dunes, calm and surreal
And a glint of a shaft of chromium steel
Golden age

Maybe I'm not ready for this, and you know it.
Maybe I'm too scared to tell you what I'm really thinking
It's not fair to stay together because of regrets we might have.
I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you?
I'm only trying to be completely honest.
So I guess this is the ending or a beautiful mistake.
And if we both agree that we shouldn't be together why does it hurt so much?
I feel like I lost my closest friend.
I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you?
I hope you're happy and completely lonely.
There I am standing all alone on sydney harbor bridge.
And you know I would jump into the fucking ocean if it meant I was truly capable of being satisfied.
Well I ever be?
Did I just give up the best thing I ever had?
I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you?
I hope you're happy and completely lonely.
I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you?
I'm only trying to be completely honest.

It's taken me a little while to bounce back
I've been falling from some thing good
People say I took a little too long
Oh I did, yeahOh baby oh
Till you came a long and you saved me,
you saved me, with that good love
You came a long and you saved me,
you saved me, oh, with that good love
It's taken me a little while to come back
I've been working on some thing good
Oh, so every now and then I tend to fall back
Oh lord, I've been misunderstood
Till you came along and you saved me
you saved me with that good love
oh yeah yeah
You came around and you saved me
you saved me, oh, with that good love
oh yeah, yeah
You've got it all baby
I'm so addicted
I, I cant help but want it more and more and more
You've got it all baby
I'm so addicted
I, I can't help but want it more and more and more
You saved me, oh
Till you came along and you saved me
you saved me, with that good love
You came a long and you saved me
you saved me, oh, with that good love
oh yeah, oh yeah
Till you came along and you saved me
you saved me with that good love
ohh you came along and you saved me
you saved me, oh, with that good love
You came a long
You saved me
you saved me

From where I stand, i can see
They've got the upper hand of me
Reminds me of this world at last
Simply changes much too fast for me
And when they call out, will I hear them
And when they fall out, will I see them
This yellow light, on the crowd
And colours way to loud to see
Reveal their drive, we could change it
Try to rearrange it
They call me a tom boy and I let them
Cause only a tom boy could forget them
And simply change it
They call me a tom boy and I love it
Cause only a tom boy could stand above it
By simply changing

Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of ten
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain,
Sayin', Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
Would ya please not stare at me like that, he said
It's just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide
Well, Judas, he just winked and said
All right, I'll leave you here
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear
I'm gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you'll be
Judas pointed down the road
And said, eternity
Eternity, said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
That's right, said Judas Priest, eternity
Though you might call it 'Paradise
I don't call it anything
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
All right," said Judas Priest
I'll see you after a while
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feelin' low and mean
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father is deceased
Well, if you are
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest
Oh, yes, he is my friend
Said Frankie Lee in fright
I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight
Yes, that's the one,said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
Well, my message is, he's down the road
Stranded in a house
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
What kind of house is this,he said
Where I have come to roam
It's not a house,said Judas Priest
It's not a house it's a home
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over everything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in every one
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst
No one tried to say a thing
When they took him out in jest
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
Nothing is revealed
Well, the moral of the story
The moral of this song,
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong.
So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'
Help him with his load
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

I wrote this once before
Long before the summer
You were then a student
And we were dark as angels
We were in the east
Working to the west
The west was looking south
And the south she had no pity
But last night I dreamed
And you were always
In it
There were
Hopes and plans and schemes
And the town was full of winners
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Has lighted things so
Differently
Has lighted things so
Differently
I wrote this once before
And we were all then working
We thought we`d stop the flow
Of a cruel and heartless woman
If I`d known this then
What would these wings have done
They`d have beat and flapped and flown
And not done and not done
But last night I dreamed
And you were always
In it
There were
Hopes and plans and schemes
And the town was full of winners
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Has lighted things so
Differently
Has lighted things so
Differently
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Has lighted things so
Differently
Lighted things so
Differently
So differently
I wrote it on my hand
I kept it in the dark
I never ran it through my hair
I stuffed it in my pocket
I wrote this on a journey
All the way from Spain
Where our fellows fought
And never came back again
To this changing light
To this changing light
Dark dark
Changing light
Dark dark dark dark

Well, I've come to know the look on your face
When you're lyin' about where you've been
Or how much you spent
I know when you will raise your fingers
To your mouth as if to wipe away the shame
It's not a game, I know you feel bad
If you ask for my forgiveness
If you call my name, I will come
If you ask for my love, I will give you some
Someday I know, you'll understand
Someday you'll finally realize
What you're doin' to yourself
If you ask for my forgiveness
If you call my name, I will come
If you ask for my love, I will give you some
We've been dancin' to that same old song
Over and over again, I wanna be your lover
I don't want to be your policeman
So, tonight when you finally make
Your way back to our door
I'll let you sleep it off like I did the night before
When you ask for my forgiveness
When you call my name, I will come
When you ask for my love, I will give you some
In the morning I will get you up
And I will smile just when you want me to
'Cause I'm, I'm all you have

(david smalley)
I said, "come on, yeah!
Come on, ooh!
I've been lookin' for someone
Just like you"
I said, "come on, yeah!
Come on, ooh!
Together we could find out
What to do"
It's not easy when you fall in love
But I'm willin' to try, yes I am
'cause I've been thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Oh, oh, oh, every way I can
I said, "come on, baby!
Come on, try!
I know you were hurt
By that other guy"
I said, "come on, baby!
Come on, please!
To make you happy
I'm on my knees"
It's not easy havin' just one girl
But I'm willin' to try, yes I am
'cause I've been thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Oh, oh, oh, every way I can
I said, "come on, baby!
Come on, try!
We got this chance
Don't let it pass you by"
I said, "come on, baby!
Come on, please!
If you make me happy
Then I'll never leave"
It's not easy when you fall in love
But I'm willin' to try, yes I am
'cause I've been thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Oh, oh, oh, every way I can
Every way I can
Every way I can

Some summers in the evening after 6 or so
I walk on down the hill
And maybe buy a beer
I think about my friends
Sometimes I wish they lived out here
But they wouldn't dig this town
No they wouldn't dig this town
Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Try not to think about it anymore
Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Anymore, no not anymore
Alice, the world is full of ugly things
That you can't change
Pretend it's not that way
It's my idea of faith
You can blow it off
And say there's good in nearly everyone
Just give them all a chance
Now let's give them all a chance
Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Try not to think about it anymore
Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Anymore, no not anymore
No it didn't work out
No it didn't work out the way we thought it would
No it didn't work out
An arranged marriage is not so good
Thank God it's you
Ya know, your timing is impeccable
I'm not fooling you
I don't know what to do
Some dude just knocked me cold
And left me on the sidewalk
Took everything I had
Everything I had
Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Try not to think about it anymore
It's getting late where you are, Alice Childress
Anymore, no not anymore
Anymore, no not anymore

Can We All Come Together
You are what you are
I am what I am
Can we all come together
With some kind of plan
I want you to laugh
But you want me to cry
Can we all come together
Hey, why don't we try
Can we all come together
Can we reach across the sea
There are worlds in between us
The sky is all we see
So let's all come together
Let's all come together
Why do we like different things
And we live different ways
Can we come together
For happier days
I want you to smile
But you let me down
Can we come together
Let's do it right now
I see you live for the sun
I live for the rain
Can we come together
Can we be the same
I want to settle down
But you want to run
Can we come together
Can we be like one

[ - racial divide... racial reconciliation - ]
Inside a dream where no one can see
shifting the shadows from my own memories
same quilt behind an imitation
just take your troubles as they come
but can't escape why did we get it wrong
a twist of fate, same black situation
it causes me pain, same blodd in our veins
but they won't hide as parts of me have died
why do we ignore the words
the price to not be heard
a circle, more or less
nunca nos rendimos, aqui estamos otra vez!!
close to the flames, just seems like hell
faicing the truth not the answers they sell
don't let us fall back, you can't bring me down
apathy kills anger its disturbing the peace
try not to be quiet, destroy the disease
it's all in you plight, it's all you should know
get out of the way, the clouds in your mind
just make a change and banish the blind

Late in the night
When the feeling isn't right
Holy night

I roll and I tumble, cried the whole night long
Yes I roll and I tumble, I cried the whole night long
I got up this morning, feeling that something going on wrong
Well now want you to love me baby, or please let me be
Yes love me baby, or please let me be
If you don't like my peaches please don't shake my tree
Well I want you to love me baby, and come on and say you'll be mine
I want you to love me baby, come and say you'll be mine
If you don't like my potatoes, please don't dig up my vine

So after all, you needed more than a death threat fall
You needed more, and I let you fall
Into the coffin with your floor-dropped jaw
And I remember you aspiration, your dream to fit in
But it's gone, and they're here
So let's kill these felons now
But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home
But I remember you, when you stand there
You stand with your eyes closed
And I feel, tonight, that I let you die
But you could have lived forever, it took smiles to keep you alive
But heroes die, and so did mine
But you go, and I stay, will it keep you at peace now
But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home
But I remember you, when you stand there
You stand with your eyes closed
You stand with your eyes closed
You stand with your eyes closed
You stand with your eyes closed
I'll dig you out, and I'll sit you up
For the fools to find you, the fools breathe into you
I'll dig you out, and I'll sit you up
For the fools to find you, the fools breathe into you
Breathe into you
So sleep child no one can touch you now
No one can hurt you now, not here anymore

Come home
It's been so long So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
Come home
It's been so long
Can't hide no more
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
Drive me home

BENEATH THIS SKIN I HIDE
I DIE TO REMEMBER
All the time I was alone
MEMORIES I HAVE
A constent reminder
Of where I've been
And who I am
(PLEA)
Beneath this skin I hide
(CONSTANT REMINDER OF YOU)
MEMORIES OF GOLD[x4]
Sorry you feel this way
(CONSTANT REMINDER OF YOU)
Sorry you feel this way
(CONSTANT REMINDER OF YOU)
One day I'll sleep
and dream...
One day I'll sleep
One day I'll sleep and dream...
The more I try the less I find
(WHAT LIES IN MY HEART)
I'll try to sleep and dream
The more I try the less I find
(WHAT LIES IN MY HEART)
I'll try to sleep and dream
Dream...
Wake me up
Sound the sirens now
(The more my eyes turn inside, war inside turns out)
(War attacks and at times I learn what my dreams mean)
Wake me up
Sound the sirens now
It's late at night
I lie awake
I feel so empty
The more your learn about yourself
The more you learn
(ABOUT YOURSELF)
The more you learn
(ABOUT YOURSELF)
The more you learn
(ABOUT YOURSELF)
About yourself

I'm in my right mind when I awake
Won't let my mind shake like a quake
Don't roll like thunder in your heart
Can't let change rearrange or tear you apart
All they can think to do is starve and strive
Takin' away life in order to survive
How will hope have a chance to stay alive
In the summer of 1999
Bring a new route I'm ready
The world's still spinnin' in the air
Man's still sittin' in despair
I won't let 'em bring me down
I'm gonna wait for the new day to come around

oh (lover) it's a (lovely) night
but outside the sky's still light
if we just sit and stare
we could take a walk through london
into regent's park or thereabouts
to watch the crowd prepare to (?)
what makes your world go round
(?) chase you down
puts mirrors in your eyes
which i smash against the ground
and any fool will know
that smashing people's hearts
can be so much more fun
than breaking people's bones
baby just don't stray too far
you're helpless on your own
these people want to change things
they're dangerous to know
fill (?) your tiny head with rubbish
take you clean away from me
there's not much that i own
but i'd like to think that i own you
have i ever told you
i only see my face
when i look into your eyes?
well how can i forgive your open legs
which stopped me dead in my tracks
like a flytrap traps a passing fly
and have you ever noticed
how we never ever swallow anybody's lies?
(god) that makes me strong
and now we've cleared the air
let's stay to watch the penalties (dispensed)
punching women kicking men
five on one, one on ten
these fuckers getting all that they deserve
it's just tricks with mirrors
that makes them think they're in the right
but we know different and who's to argue
on such a lovely night?

When I was young, I first encountered my crippled lungs
I felt them burn, and cursed them ever since
I was turning blue, in a match right in front of you
And I slithered to the floor, hope I score some more
I won't go where the sun doesn't shine
Go crazy in the evening if we sail upright
Love is a shadow, in the brightness it dies
Because tonight
We raise the sun, and we shine it over everyone
If we want a gradual hush
Our lips should kiss each other so
I just want to feel your body
I want you to know your quarry
You can see the world looking down from a different universe
Can we save every single one of them, if we only have five hands
My father cradled us; we're bright blue and we're covered in blood
We staggered through the door, trouble's taken score
I won't go where the sun doesn't shine
Go crazy in the evening if we sail upright
Love is a shadow, in the brightness it dies
Because tonight
We raise the sun, and we shine it over everyone
If we want a gradual hush
Our lips should kiss each other so
I just want to feel your body
I want you to know your quarry
I just want to, feel your body, I want you to, know your quarry
I just want to, feel your body, I want you to, know your quarry

"(By the) Wayside"- Neriah/ Avid- Altered States-Jetspeed Records- 2005
It's just a matter of time
before it all goes away
so tell me everything will be o.k.
You never know what you'll find
beside your feelings today
don't you know- there's got to be a way
By the wayside
Whenever nothing is right
and everything's upside-down
know that something's got to turn around
I'm going out of my mind
just trying to figure it out
oh, won't you tell me what it's all about
By the wayside
How long, how wrong?
It's just a matter of time
before it all goes away
so tell me everything will be o.k.
You never know what you'll find
beside your feelings today
don't you know- there's got to be a way?
By the wayside

We had an apartment in the city.
Me and my husband liked living there.
It's been years since the kids have grown,
a life of their own, left us alone.
John and Linda live in Omaha.
Joe is somewhere on the road.
We lost Davy in the Korean war.
I still don't know what for, don't matter any more.
You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
"Hello in there. Hello"
Me and my husband, we don't talk much anymore.
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.
Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, "Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do."
You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
ah, but, but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
"Hello in There. Hello."
So if you're walking down the street sometime
and you should spot some hollow ancient eyes,
don't you pass them by and stare
as if you didn't care.
Say, "Hello in there. Hello."

Well, my head is spinnin'
Like a spinnin' top
I got rhythm in my feet
And I really wanna hop
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight
I got money to waste
A car to drive
We'll go out and play
The joints a little while
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight
And we'll take in a show
And go to a dance
You won't be lonesome
'Cause I'll make romance
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight
Now wait, let's have a little taste
'Cause haste makes waste
We might wanna stop
At another little place
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight

Some times it's simplenet things that make it hard
Spoiled baby tee's with credit cards
Overtime always on my mind
Could have beens eating away inside now
Praise God and pass the bottle of Beam
Because tonight I can't seem to say what I mean
Don't know if I would even if I could, Amen.
Somehow this seems like borrowed time
Pay it no mind, Everything is find
But sometimes I'd rather hear laughter
While this whole place died.
A Johnny Jump-Up is a lovely thing
A pint of cider and some whiskey
I had four dead inside of me
Just to hear this jack-ass sing his line about
How he used to hang out somewhere "back in the day"
Knowing terms only an asshole would say
So I sat there drinking more
Thinking about drinking more
Nelson Algren came to me
And said clebrate the ugly things
The beat up side of what they call pride
Could be the measure of what they call pride
Could be the measure of these days
God save Otis Redding because I know he's never gone
As sick falls from this mouth hear me sing it wrong
Is it "cigarettes and coffee" now or dreams to be remebered
I'll leave regrets for dead and sing along
So I'm reaching for the phone, I don't want to be alone
I want to get some friends ehre tonight
I got a basement full of booze and some blues to lose
I'll ignore the whole world tonight
It will be alright.

Denial Waits
-verse 1-
Denial waits its
Here to claim me now
As I crawl down to hell
For a chance that youll come around and
-pre 1-
Lay down tonight
But Im left
Telling myself that
Everything will be alright
-Chorus 1-
Run away
From the way that you love me
With no regrets
Walk away
Dont want to hear that youre sorry
From words unsaid
So stay away
I know you wanna destroy me
And fade away cause I know
-VERSE 2-
If I just close my eyes
I still see your lips
Saying
Everything will be alright
If I saw you right now
Im embarrassed to say
Id take you back and
We could just pretend you never went away
-Chorus 2-
Run away
From the way that you love me
With no regrets just
Walk away
Dont want to hear that youre sorry
From words unsaid
So stay away
I know you wanna destroy me
Just save you breath cause I know
-verse 3-
Denial waits its
Here to claim you now
Denial waits its
Here to claim you
-Chorus 3-
Run away
From the way that you love me
With no regrets just
Walk away
Dont want to hear that youre sorry
From words unsaid
Denial waits (x2)

There's a worm in your head,
Squirming over on me.
Leaves a paper thin scab
And you're laughing.
It's too crowded
With the skull cap on. (? )
When you're amplified.
And everybody's tired of the noise that you make,
And everybody's tired of the voice you're faking.
Nobody's counting, cause everybody's fine.
And everybody's whistling because everybody's blind.
There's a page of your face from the xerox machine.
Gray matter, bending, blending.
Makes me sleepy when you can't define
How far you're trailing behind.
You're always sedated.
You're simplified.
Picking off the scabs
From the skin of your lies.
And nobody's counting, cause everybody's fine.
And everybody's buying it cause everybody'd blind.

Rolling and tumbling ain't done me no harm
Gonna boogie my night all away
Rita and Greta been twisting my arm into
Heading out west
Down to the Burlesque
Saving my ace through to you
Well, drinking and sinking, I'm feeling alright
Right down to my snakey spat shoes
Just about shutdown and three in the night
Because I'm heading out west
Down to the Burlesque
Show 'em a moon at the door
We got to show the Burlesque
Rolling, tumbling
Sure ain't done me no harm
Drinking, sinking
Just been too bad on my arm
Well I finally lost Rita and Greta went home
I guess that leaves just me and you
Been kinda sneaky to get you alone
Oh but you in that dress
Destination Burlesque
I got all my cards in one shoe
I got all my cards in one
Rolling, tumbling
Sure ain't done me no harm
Drinking, sinking
Just been too bad on my arm
Well I finally lost Rita and Greta went home
I guess that leaves just me and you
Been kinda sneaky to get you alone
Oh but you in that dress
Destination Burlesque
I got all my cards in one shoe

I love you and all that you do
I need you to see me through
I want you and I say
Oh and god bless you
She told me you're going away
I said how can I make you stay
�I love you and I say
Oh and god bless you
If I call out your name
Could you hear me calling
If I said that it's wrong
Would you say I'm falling
If I told you the truth would you
Stay
Say ya say ya
I love you and all that you do
I need you to see me through
I want you and I say
Oh and god bless you

I'm going to Africa, yes ma'am,
I'm a brick, was President Lincoln.
Okay, Mittens!
There's a dog in the vent,
Chicken necks,
I pick Ken Griffey Jr.
I fell out two times
I'm pedaling backwards,
This Snowflake tastes like fishsticks
We're a totem pole
Dying tickles
I heard a Frankenstein lives there,
She's touching my special area,
Go banana!
Ralphie (Ralphie)
Get off (Get off)
The stage (The stage)
Sweetheart (Sweetheart)
Oh say, can you rock?
I'm a pop sensation! I'm a pop sensation!
Salmon gutter
I'm Idaho,
You smell like dead bunnies,
That's where I saw the leprechaun,
Fun toys are fun
Chocolate microscopes,
You're not it, that is so 1991,
I bit my tongue

1-2-3-4... Go!
How can you sleep at night, when the sound of the clock is ticking away our time?
Will we make it through the night?
I'll believe It when I see it, and I'm blinded by the sunlight
Faded through my eyes,
I see your silhouette.
Now the visions from last night are coming alive, coming alive
We're dead, we're dead, now we own the night
We're dead, we're dead, live the dead beat life
We're dead, we're dead, every single night
So lets party in the graveyard.
*Calling all monsters,
Zombies and creeps...
Tonight's the night for dreamers
And true believers in the after life
Let's get this party started! *
I take back all my poor words.
Talk is cheap, but my mind is rich
When I close my eyes
You grab my wrist,
And pull me in to your cold dead lips
In to your cold dead lips
You're a cold heart bitch
In to your cold hard lips
You're just a cold hard bitch
We're dead, we're dead, now we own the night
We're dead, we're dead, live the dead beat life
We're dead, we're dead, every single night
So lets party in the graveyard!
Party in the graveyard!
They say the world is ending
What did you live for?
Let go of all your vices
They're just controlling us
They say we're dead and it ends tonight
I say, " Then lets party in the graveyard!"
We're dead, we're dead, now we own the night
We're dead, we're dead, live the dead beat life
We're dead, we're dead, every single night
So lets party in the graveyard
Party in the graveyard!
Party in the graveyard!

You want the whole nine
Yard lies
then lets hear a jeer
For the nice guys
I know the end of this book
And it's a happy one please book
But you cant skip the start
And break for the good part
But our guile
Is argyle
Yes a guy's guile
Is oh what a guile
I got the message its on
It was there all along
And if I lead you along
Then I read you wrong
There was a bridge
And a tunnel to
And does a suitcase
Kinda look like a coffin
(well, yes)
and does it happen often
(well , yes)
and am I worried
(well yes)
I guess but it makes sense
I got the message its on
It was there all along
And if I lead you along
Then I read you wrong
(What a buy what am I doing here )
I write her
letters from my new home
Crying
then I kissed the phone
Im writing
letters to angels
with heavenly pens and holey tongues sent
coded messages to
our northern neighbors

Six o'clock in the morning
Still sitting here pouring the drinks till they're gone
We did everything together
We would have done it forever
How did we go wrong
I know that what goes up comes down
I didn't know you hit the ground
Why'd ya have to give it up
You were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high Michelle
We did it just for a good time
A misunderstood time
We lived with a fear
I wish we still could have done things
Not overhung things
I wish you were here
And now I'll live a life of could have beens
Until new life begins
Why'd ya have to give it up
You were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high Michelle
I'll say another prayer tonight
And I'll see you in the light
Why'd ya have to give it up
You were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high Michelle

I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
And I won't be much when you get through with me
I'm losin' weight and turnin' mighty pale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
But now the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
And I won't be much when you get through with me
I'm losin' weight and turnin' mighty pale
It looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, every night you drag me where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I always thought the way you talked was neat
And I dreamed that when you speak, you speak to me
But you're always out of reach and I can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet, I'll want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
You're the only soul inside that makes me shake
And the crazy senseless things you make me take
It would really make my day if you'd only move away
'Cause I'm scared that if you stay, I'll want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
But you're always out of reach
And I can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet
I'm fermenting, can't you see
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
I want to touch you
Touch you, touch you
Touch you, touch you, touch you

Hemlock five caught me out there later on
It's the girl I told the man, but he swore he'd prove me wrong
Not seeing as I saw it as I gazed at the skyline
Someone dropped a dime, man, someone took the time
I'm not a man with a grasp on reality
Kerouac is wack but I'm down with Dostoevsky
Sugar's got my back plus Baretta 380's
One of which I dropped as the man tried to bait me
Come on, find yourself
Come on, find yourself
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
Now don't get it messed up, they got me all dressed up
To feed me to the fishes, I use my mojo for the loco
I know the soft machine and its goings ons
And I'll be damned if the man's gonna spill me
You wanna see me get wild and crazy
I'm sorry man but your threats don't phase me
You covered the ground but you're lazy
Come on, come on, contest me
Come on, find yourself
Come on, find yourself
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you, it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you

Colin Zeal knows the value of mass appeal
He's a pedestrian walker, he's a civil talker
He's an affable man with a plausible plan
Keeps his eye on the news, keeps his future in hand
(And then he)
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha
While sitting in traffic, Colin thinks in automatic
He's an immaculate dresser, he's your common aggressor
Colin's the modern retard with a love of bombast
Keeps his eye on the news, doesn't dwells on the past
(And then he)
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha
(And then he)
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha

He's an affable man, with a carrotene tan

I am a happy nihilist, no absolute truth does exist
When I decide to shake my fist
I only got myself to blame
Cause we're all players and life's the game
I only take what I need, I am so light on my feet
I will not stop or concede, I am not driven by greed
No moral compass for me, it's all just natural feelings
Existence has no meaning, there's no such thing as happy
But late at night when I sleep, I dream of more than I see
There's something burning in me, a driving need to be free,
Why do I sit here and think about the things that I need?
There's nothing left to believe, oh, is it all just a dream?
I've taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like Hell to trust nobody else but me
I've taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like Hell to trust nobody else
I used to read everything, I used to need nothing
I used to put my money on me: I used to be something
Now I can't sleep, 'cause I'm not happy
I've taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like Hell to trust nobody else but me
I've taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like Hell to trust nobody else but me
Woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh
Why am I haunted by the metaphysical?
Is it a cosmic lie or is it literal?
The books I read that used to free my mind
Have made me more blind but the truth I'll find it
I was a happy nihilist
Now I'm wondering why I exist
I've taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like Hell to trust nobody else but me
I've taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf
But it still hurts like Hell to trust nobody else but me
Woah oh, oh

And if I knew the answers I would tell you now
Just what would be the chances that I could show you how
If I knew where all the tears were coming from
Add up all the years that you've been gone
This is that new song
I told you about twenty years ago
Do you know what true romance is and could you show me now
Just what would be the chances that I could tell you how
If I knew where all the tears were flowing to
Guide them to a river where I'd swim with you downstream
This is that old dream I told you about twenty years ago
And could you hold me now

I wanna ask you fellows
Why do you shut me out?
When I've driven every place
That they call land
I talk plain talk
I've seen the moon sittin' on the road, and
And I don't eat no chateaubriands
And I drive my car
Under same stars
Where the miles are
Come back I demand
Dear gentlemen
Please let me in
I don't know how I can
Make you understand
I'm a pure denizen of the Citizens Band
I'm a pure denizen of the Citizens Band
I'm a pure denizen of the Citizens Band
I'm a pure denizen of the Citizens Band
Hey friend, know what I'd do
If I was makin' the bucks
I'd move into a place
Where all they had was trucks
'Cause there's one thing I can't stand
There's one thing that I cannot stand
One thing I cannot stand
Can't stand, cannot stand, can't stand

On the seventh day
he arrived to stay,
a sky so grey opened up for him.
Like a hallow man,
he kneels down to pray without a shame, calling her name.
Christina bleeds.
The rope's caress, it's oh, so tight.
A hanged man's love the last despise.
Christina bleeds.
Rope is tight, so fucking tight.
Her fragile touch the last thing he felt.
And Christina bleeds.
As the evening crawls
she feels the loss when the wind weeps through,
the promise carved in cross.
In the evil dusk she disappear for the lust,
lost love that sears.
Christina bleeds.

I pretend to sleep while she cries at night
Then slowly dries her eyes
Vacant are the words of mine
That say we are alright
I don't want, don't want to be
Your hate and misery
But I want to be your crutch and I want to be your thing
In this eternal un-ending
Hold on tight but don't hold me down
Stay all night if you wanna
Do your worst, your worst to me
No one will ever hear you
So let me get this straight
I'll take a minute if I may
And try to take it all
Take it away for you
Black and blue with residue
Your open heart and the untrue
Try to let us go
Another night without
I don't want, don't want to be
Your hate and misery
But I want to be your crutch and I want to be your thing
In this eternal un-ending
Hold on tight but don't hold me down
Stay all night if you wanna
Do your worst, your worst to me
No one will ever hear you

(leonard phillips)
Wake from your sleep all you weary ones
Who are leary of the night
Look to the east all you dreary ones
Who are waiting for the light
Dawn is breaking and a new day is born
The world is singing the song of the dawn
Birds are singing
Hear them welcome the morn
They're sweetly singing the song of the dawn
Yesterday the sky was grey
Look this morning they're blue
The smiling sun tells everyone
Come and start life anew

I don't know why the winter's so long
It wears me out, it goes on and on
Yeah I don't know why the winter's so long
It seems never-ending, it goes on and on
I know you blame yourself
But don't
I don't know why this town is so small
It makes me mad, I've seen it all
Yeah I don't know why this town is so small
There's noboby left here, everyone's gone
I know you blame youself
But don't

When the time comes around
I want you to know
You can count on me
When it all comes down
You'll know where I'll be
Standing right next to you
'cos I'll be true to you
I'll be true to you
When the days grow dark
And the winds grow cold
I'll still be with you
I'm tried and I'm tested
And I won't let you down
You can count on me
Because I'll be true to you
I'll be true to you
This love that I've found
It flows like a river
And it's all for you
The streets of this town
Speak only one name
And that name is you
So when the time comes around
I want you to know
You can count on me
When it all comes down
You'll know where I'll be
Standing right next to you
Because I'll be true to you
I'll be true to you

Sun's up, uuh huh, looks okay
The world survives into another day
And I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
I had another dream about lions at the door
They weren't half as frightening as they were before
But I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
Walls windows trees, waves coming through
You be in me and I'll be in you
Together in eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
Up among the furs where it smells so sweet
Or down in the valley where the river used to be
I got my mind on eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
And I'm wondering where the lions are
I'm wondering where the lions are
Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake
Thousand-year-old hieroglyphs doing a double take
Pointing a finger at eternity
I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy
Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun
Polished and precise like the brain behind the gun
(Should be) they got me thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
And I'm wondering where the lions are
I'm wondering where the lions are
Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay
One of these days we're going to sail away
Going to sail into eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
And I'm wondering where the lions are
I'm wondering where the lions are

D. Cassidy/S. Shifrin/M.D. Ehmig
I've been waitin' in your dark room
With the full moon in my eyes
Baby you should have locked your window
'Cause I warned you I'd come back to say goodnight
And I've waited all this time to let you know
It's taken me this long to let you go
You remember me
How you stole my life
I've come back to get
What you took that night
You can't hurt me now
I'm all over you
When I leave my heart goes with me
When I leave my heart goes with me this time
Got no switchblade in my pocket
Got no razor up my sleeve
Nothin' I'd do could compare to
The way you cut the heart right out of me
And I've got to see your face before I go
There's something I've just got to let you know
You remember me
How you stole my life
I've come back to get
What you took that night
You can't hurt me now
I'm all over you
When I leave my heart goes with me
When I leave my heart goes with me this time
I've fallen from the mountain
Been swept up by the storm
Stumbled through the desert
Just to make it to you door
So I think it's only fair you should know
Now I'm strong enough to really let you go
