                    In the world today, there is more music than ever before. This abundance of musical data provides
                    opportunities for us to take advantage of it. One of the facets of the music industry right now is
                    that redundant lyrics sell extremely well. We wanted to take advantage of this formulaic industry
                    and automate the process of generating lyrics in order to make the music industry more efficient and
                    versatile. Our objective with this project is to analyze the current ocean of music out there and
                    find
                    patterns that can be used to create new lyrics. Through this project, we aim to generate new lyrics
                    specific to ten different genres and shed some light on several related aspects like their
                    popularity prediction, clustering and genre classification.

                    A genre can be described as a collection of patterns. Songs that share these patterns can be
                    considered
                    as belonging to the same genre. These pattern mainly depend on the rhythm, speed, key,
                    instrumentation and other musical dynamics. But with how genres have been developed, can we determine them
                    just by analyzing lyrics?

                    The <a href="http://millionsongdataset.com/">Million Song Dataset</a> is a dataset curated by an
                    organization named EchoNest (now Spotify) that has one million songs where each song consists of 41
                    distinct features related to audio analysis (tempo, duration, mode, loudness etc), artist
                    information (artist popularity, artist familiarity etc) and metadata (releases, title, song hotness
                    etc). We look at the MSD summary data set for our project as the full MSD dataset is 280GB in size
                    and difficult to work with. The summary dataset also has all the songs but it has only those
                    features which are suitable to save in a key value format.

                    released, artist, genre, and lyrics. All songs in the database were released between 1968 and 2016,
                    excluding several songs incorrectly labeled with invalid years.

                    For the MetroLyrics data, we dropped duplicates and removed non-english songs using a library called
                    CLD2. This resulted in a loss of around 50% of the data and only 155954 records persisted out of the
                    total 362237.

                    To begin with, we looked at how the different attributes in the dataset are distributed. The aim was
                    to identify if there is any correlation between the attributes or not. The following image shows
                    distribution plots for the attributes - "artist_familiarity", "artist_hotttnesss", "song_hotttness",
                    "duration", "key", "tempo", "loudness", "mode" and time_signature".

                    Apart from the distribution of values, we also looked at the correlation between different attributes.
                   We can see that the attributes like "artist_hotttnesss" and "artist_familiarity" are
                    significantly correlated and both of them are again correlated to "song_hotttness".

                    One way to understand more about the data and its underlying patterns is unsupervised methods such
                    as clustering.
                    We wanted to see if the lyrical data had any patterns. Would clustering group the lyrics in
                    different genres?
                    Would it find other patterns in the lyrics? What exactly would the clusters
                    represent?
                </p>
                <h4 class="roboto">Feature Extraction</h4>
                <p>
                    We started by extracting features from the textual lyrics data by applying Doc2Vec on Metrolyrics
                    dataset.
                    The reason why we choose Doc2Vec instead of Bag of Words is because a Bag of Words only gives
                    information regarding
                    individual words and their frequencies, but lacks the semantic meaning and grammar that is
                    associated with real
                    speech. Doc2Vec is a neural network based model that converts each document to a vector of a
                    specific size of our choice.
                    For our experiments we chose it to be a 300 dimensional vector.
                    This heavily reduces both computation expensiveness and brings along the power of the underlying
                    information of the semantics of each song rather than just the word information. We trained Doc2Vec
                    using 20 Epochs and each Epoch going 20 iterations and a learning rate of 0.025.
                </p>
                <h4 class="roboto">Principal Component Analysis</h4>
                <p>
                    After extracting the doc2vec features for each song, we did principal component analysis on the same
                    to see if we can represent the data using fewer dimensions. After performing PCA on our data we
                    realized that the variance is fairly evenly split across all of our components. This means that we
                    cannot reduce our dimensionality any further. This makes sense as Doc2vec uses each feature to
                    diseminate the information related to each document
                    across the vector.

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Cumulative Variance vs Number of Components</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After applying principal component analysis we move on to data visualization, plotting the first two
                    components and the first three components in a 2D and a 3D plot respectively. However, as shown in
                    the pictures below, the visualization was not great. This is because as found in
                    Dim-Reduction, the share of variance across the components is fairly even.
                    In order to mitigate this, we decided to use TSNE in order to obtain a 2-D representation of our
                    data that incorporates all of the components.The reason why we did not use TSNE to reduce the
                    dimensionality of our data is because while TSNE is great for visual representation it removes too
                    much information for clustering.

                <p>
                    Finally, we cluster the lyrical features using the K Means Clustering algorithm. We use the elbow method
                    to find the best number of clusters.
                    However, looking at the plot it was not very straightforward to choose the elbow. We decided to
                    proceed with 20 clusters in order to achieve best computation time while keeping a low sum of
                    squared distances.

                </figure>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We found that suprisingly, even with the variance qualities mentioned previously, the clusters were
                    still clearly differentiable even when using just 2 or 3 of the top PCA components. We also graph
                    the clusters using TSNE, the graph however was not how we expected, possibly due the fact that
                    informations that was used in clustering was removed in TSNE but overall the TSNE graph looks better
                    than the original data with genre. In order to understand how well these clusters represent each
                    genre,
                    we generated graphs for the genre distribution and wordcloud for each cluster and the results are
                    shown
                    below.

                    Doc2Vec is a unsupervised learning algorithm that makes vectors out of pragraphs or in our case
                    lyrics.
                    It allows us to take some lyrics and put them into a format that we can train with.

                    As we can see most of the clusters contain a large percentage of rock songs while a few of them were able
                    to sepearate out Hip-Hop, Metal, R&B and Pop. Before going into the problems, there are a few
                    interesting gems here:
                    First off, we seem to have found a subgenre of Hip-Hop clusters 2 and 11 which are interesting due to the
                    differences in words.
                    One seems to be about rap songs about 'money' while the other is mainly profanity. Another
                    interesting thing is that
                    the pop cluster(16) has the largest use of 'baby' and 'oh-oh' as one might expect. Metal is another
                    interesting one as it seems to
                    have a focus on 'life' and 'death'. Another tidbit is the prominence of 'now' and 'know' across many
                    different clusters. It seems that
                    these words are used often and used together. An issue with the clusters is the prominence of Rock,
                    and it's simply a problem
                    with the dataset as we mentioned earlier. It's unforunate but the results still ended up being very
                    enlightening.

                    In order to generate a popular song, we need to know what makes a song popular. Looking at the
                    correlation matrix, we can see that the song popularity is definitely related to artist popularity
                    and familiarity, which seems reasonable, but do other factors also affect the popularity of a song? To
                    find out, we tried to predict the "song_hotttness" using other attributes from the MSD dataset. We
                    tried various regression models for this task and the results were as follows:

                    In order to understand which features of the song affect the popularity the most, we plot the
                    weights of the features for all the models mentioned baove. As we can see in the figure below, the
                    most important features are "artist_familiarity", "artist_hotttnesss" and the "loudness" of the
                    song. From this, we infer that the more famous an artist is, more the popularity of a track made by
                    them.

                    We were also curious to study the affect of lyrics on "song_hotttnesss". Therefore, we also trained
                    the same models we used above on features extracted from both MSD and Metrolyrics data. The lyrics
                    were converted into vectors using Doc2Vec module. The vectors obtained were high-dimensional which were then transformed using
                    PCA reduction. These lyrics features were concatenated with MSD features to make the complete
                    feature set and the regression models were trained on that. We observed that the models gave higher
                    values of RMSE when trained with lyrics than when trained without them. This is probably because
                    many of the most common words repeat in more and less popular songs to a similar extent. Hence, we
                    conclude that lyrics have no significant effect on popularity of songs.

                    The next step was to learn to classify the genres of the songs based on their lyrics. For this, we
                    converted the lyrics to vectors using Doc2Vec and reduced the dimensionality of the vectors obtained
                    by PCA reduction. Several classifier models were trained on the lyrics features and then tested for
                    their performance scores. The results have been summarized below:

                    We could infer that lyrics have a positive impact on genre classification of songs. This is probably
                    because songs of the same genre have similar kinds of lyrics. We noticed that the most seemingly
                    unique
                    genres were Hip Hop, Metal, and Pop. Furthermore, Metal and Pop seem to share some confusion
                    with
                    Rock. Thus, unsupervised learning showed positive results.

                <h4 class="roboto">Handling Skewed Dataset by Resampling Techniques</h4>
                <p>As we know that our dataset is heavily skewed towards rock genre which can affect the classifiers
                    accuracy. Therefore, we created a balanced dataset by undersampling the majority classes which
                    resulted in 1000 songs per genre (10000 songs overall). We then trained our best classifier -
                    Multilayer Perceptron on this dataset. The model was able to acheive a test accuracy of 47.8% and a
                    training accuracy of 99.6%. (overfitting)</p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, we also tested the Multi Layer Perceptron by creating a balanced dataset by oversampling
                    the minority classes (creating duplicates). The model was able to achieve a testing accuracy of
                    44.8%
                    and a training accuracy of 78.9%.

                <p>
                    After learning to predict the popularity and the genre of a song, our ambitions fly high and with
                    motivation from from Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn architecture that performs character level text
                    generation, we unleash the power of Recurrent Neural Networks to generate novel song lyrics.

                <h4 class="roboto">The Pre-Trained Reddit Text Gen Model</h4>
                <p>
                    Built on top of tensorflow and keras, we have used a Python package called TextGenRNN. This is a
                    wrapper over the char neural network model and also enables a great deal of flexibility. We used
                    Google Colab to train our model with an environment configured with 2 vCPUs, 13GB memory and a K80
                    GPU. With rnn size of 256 units and 5 layers, we trained our network for 50 epochs. We do this on
                    top of the pretrained model provided with the package which has been trained on hundreds of text
                    documents acquired from Reddit. The pre-trained model is useful since it has already gained
                    knowledge and has embeddings that include the modern internet grammar. The model has a great
                    influence on the language we are learning and helps in the generation of subsequent lyrics.
                </p>
                <h4 class="roboto">Transfer Learning: From Reddit to MetroLyrics</h4>
                <p>
                    To incorporate the understanding for our lyrics, we have used this pretrained model and retrained
                    all the layers on 1000 songs from each genre, i.e. 10000 songs altogether. This enabled our model to
                    learn relations and context not present in the original dataset. This way we have transferred the
                    learning from one dataset (Reddit data) to another (songs dataset) and have combined them to get
                    some novel results.
                </p>
                <h4 class="roboto">Word Level and Character Level Text Generation</h4>
                <p>
                    We tried both word level and character level models. The results from the character level model are
                    not as good as the word-level model. Because the latter is better at capturing long-distance
                    dependencies if trained for a similar amount of data. In order to predict up to the third word from
                    the beginning of a sentence, a
                    word-level RNN has to make two predictions to get there, while the character-level model must make
                    predictions for the number of times equal to the number of characters before the second space. The
                    result gets more error prone with the higher number of predictions the model needs to make.
                </p>
                <h4 class="roboto">Introducing Genre Bias</h4>
                <p>
                    In order to generate better lyrics for each genre, after finishing the first phase of training, we
                    retrain the model seperately on 1000 songs from each genre (10). Thus, creating 10 genre biased
                    models, we use these models to genreate novel lyrics.
                </p>
                <h4 class="roboto">Evaluation</h4>
                <p>
                    In order to evaluate the lyrics generated by our model, we tought of two different approaches. One
                    was to provide a the first few lines of a known song as a seed for the model and let it generate the
                    new lyrics baed on that. Once the lyrics are generated by the model we compare how similar it is to
                    the original song. We use BLEU score as our metric for the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score, or BLEU for short, is a metric for evaluating a generated
                    sentence to a reference sentence. This is achieved by counting matching n-grams in original lyrics
                    and our newly generated lyrics starting from the seed of the original song. Below are some of the
                    results on comparing with the reference songs. Although BLEU score is a good metric to evaluate
                    machine translation which is also based on RNN models, it might not be the best way to measure the
                    goodness of a text generation model, so we take the results with grain of salt.

                <p>
                    Another way to evaluate the lyrics generated by our model is to convert the lyrics to doc2vec and
                    then use our classification model to predict the genre in which our lyrics is falling into. If the
                    predicted genre is same as the genre towards which the model has been biased, then we can say that
                    the results are sound.
